I agree, they both worked on it. In interviews with Pratchett he says the talked almost daily. I&#039;m excited for my venture into Discworld, satirical scifi is always great.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Terry Pratchett wrote more of the book? Hmm, yeah, I think I won&#039;t have trouble believing that. I read thus book having already read lots of Gaiman&#039;s works but none of Pratchett&#039;s. And most of the humor was unfamiliar and yet totally hilarious! I&#039;d have to start buying more Pratchett books, I guess. Although, as you said, it&#039;s no fair to shine the spotlight on only one of them - the book wouldn&#039;t be as good if &#039;twas only written by either one (but that&#039;s me).]]></description>
