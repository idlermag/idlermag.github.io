					<description><![CDATA[Excellent advice from a veteran for a first timer like myself. I could almost see the circuit in my mind&#039;s eye. Hear the crowd and cars roaring. Another great article from Dr. Hansman, inspiring enthusiasm for new and old fans of F1. And I hope to meet the good doctor and her husband at COTA. Maybe get her autograph with the sharpie that just made my packing list.....]]></description>

Yes, I do have a parking spot (Lot F! come say hi!) - thank you for providing more information on the shuttles. I hope they work as planned and everyone&#039;s able to get to the track with as few hassles as possible. (Fingers crossed!)
As for the prohibited list, I&#039;m holding out hope the one I received with the tickets (that does not mention horns) is the most recent list...and I&#039;ll be able to bring the horns. Otherwise, I guess there will be some track workers scaring one another at the front gates with our horns....have to at least give it a shot, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You must have a parking spot at the track.  

For those that do not, be sure you know where your shuttle pick-up location is, how to get there and where to park.  Keep in mind the earliest shuttle is at 7:00 AM and may take 45 minutes or longer to get to the track.

I have a feeling the shuttle situation will turn into a, how you say, cluster-fugazi  so get there early.

On another note, the prohibited items list includes &quot;horns&quot; (which I interpret to include &quot;air-horns&quot;) and other &quot;Items that may be deemed a safety hazard or annoyance to participants or guests&quot;.  See the latest list here: http://www.circuitoftheamericas.com/prohibited-items]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another very good article, Erin - somewhat cooler than the others (see what I did there?). I would also advise taking that plastic poncho to Silverstone - it&#039;s *always* raining there.

Enjoy the weekend everyone, It&#039;s going to be wonderful.]]></description>
