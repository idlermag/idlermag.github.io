					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll start a new club when i get back there.  Read any damn book you want and don&#039;t finish it if you don&#039;t feel like it.  On meeting day bring along some food, and if you want to talk about books - that&#039;s okay too.  I personally tend to stay up until all hours of the night to finish almost any book, it really doesn&#039;t matter what it is or how well written.  I know I enjoyed it when I go out searching for the first or next book in a series (I do get out of order a lot) or something else by the same author.]]></description>

You just need a group of people who will forgive you for not finishing the book. It helps if there&#039;s good food. :)]]></description>

Thanks! The Lord of the Rings does go on forever! Whenever I tell people that scifi books are my favorite, they ask me about those books and then I feel like I&#039;m not a true scifi fan. I think I&#039;ll work on the Handmaid&#039;s Tale today, I really liked the movie too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I always start reading books with the intention of finishing them, but there is always the odd one which i just can&#039;t get into! If i&#039;m not into a book then i&#039;m not really fussed about what happens in the end so i stop reading!
I read The Handmaid&#039;s Tale, it is worth finishing, but if i&#039;m honest i only read the book after watching the 1990 film adaptation (the film i thought was much better!).
i got stuck reading Cloud Atlas, and i never finished The Lord of the Rings because i got so bored of it - it goes on forever!]]></description>
