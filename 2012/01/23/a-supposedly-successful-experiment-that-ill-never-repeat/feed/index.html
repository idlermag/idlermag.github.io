					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2012/01/23/a-supposedly-successful-experiment-that-ill-never-repeat/#comment-3035&quot;&gt;brendamso&lt;/a&gt;.

The funny thing is that I used to prefer Burger King to, say, McDonald&#039;s, and now I&#039;ve totally reversed. While McDonald&#039;s is remarkably flavorless, it at least feels in my mouth like (overcooked) ground beef. As I get older I find the texture of Burger King beef increasingly disturbing. (By default, in a fast food pinch, I prefer Wendy&#039;s to either.)

Thanks for commenting. And I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if BK delivery starts popping up in other places as well. It&#039;s expanding around here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I personally enjoy eating Burger King, maybe not on a daily or even weekly basis, but I&#039;m usually too lazy to get up and go to Burger King.  Alas they do not have a Burger King with home delivery here where I live :(]]></description>
