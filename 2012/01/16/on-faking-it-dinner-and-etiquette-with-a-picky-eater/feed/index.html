					<description><![CDATA[One of the only common foods in the world that I don&#039;t enjoy is bell pepper.  Green, red, yellow or rainbow, the taste makes me ill.  I get the same kind of flack.  I might not share your particular aversion, but I can certainly understand the feeling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s easier, sometimes, to lie than have to listen to people laugh about your &quot;irrational distaste for onions.&quot; I, like you, absolutely loathe onions. I love so many foods, but onions I just cannot stomach. Once, a friend&#039;s mother asked if I&#039;d like some eggs with greens and of course I said yes, only to find out it was littered with onions and peppers. She then proceeded to take a seat across from me at the table and watch me eat. I swallowed every bite whole! I didn&#039;t chew once because I knew if I did, I was likely to violently gag through the whole meal. 
So, I understand where you&#039;re coming from. I enjoyed this piece specifically because there is another person out there who finds the slimy-but-crunchy texture of onions loathsome.]]></description>

Hi Katie! Thanks for reading. Your husband has it way worse than I do, since mine&#039;s just a sort of violent dislike + gag reflex. Tell him I UNDERSTAND.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jill,
My husband is horrifically allergic to onions (he violently throws up within an hour.) Many people claim he is lying about his allergy. I have been trapped into more than one meal in which I have had to watch, in horror, as he politely forced down something with onion in it, only to buy Pedialite and saltines on the way home. Great post. I&#039;m going to forward it to him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I try to make it a point to ask what (if any) aversions to certain foods people have before inviting them for dinner. If only all people thought to do so, then the hurt feelings could be avoided without the need for stealth.]]></description>
