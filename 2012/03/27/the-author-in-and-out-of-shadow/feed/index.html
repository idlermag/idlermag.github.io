					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you that while it&#039;s not fair to ask an author to be &quot;perfect&quot; -- particularly an author who lived in a different time and place -- there&#039;s a real uncertainty in buying the work of a writer who advocates for and may financially support causes that one finds morally objectionable. It&#039;s easy with a dead writer, when you can discharge your responsibility by voicing your objection.

I don&#039;t think there is an easy answer. I don&#039;t think we&#039;re obligated to shun the work of people with different (or even abhorrent) political views -- in fact, I think we all lose if we never encounter divergent views, but I might be a bit more likely to check out such an author&#039;s book from the library rather than buying a hardcover.]]></description>

I didn&#039;t know Lovecraft was racist. It makes me not want to know anything about an author, which can really take away from their work sometimes. It&#039;s almost easier to treat the book as its own entity.]]></description>

I completely agree about nice or rude authors I&#039;ve met in person. I will recommend a book I haven&#039;t read if the author was kind and gave a great reading.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I too have the same issues frequently when it comes to comic book writers. If I read an interview where extreme politics are involved (those with which I disagree, of course) or hear writers tell tales out of school to finger point or evoke sympathy, I tend to shut down on them. 

It&#039;s both a shame and a blessing that the line between the work and the worker, so to speak, is frequently so blurry in art and literature. H.P. Lovecraft challenges many of his fans with the same dilemma, given his attitudes on race. For every instance where an author&#039;s background enriches the reading of a seminal work, you&#039;ll come across something distasteful that may have the opposite effect.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bookseller and when I meet authors who are rude I find, unless they&#039;re fantastic writers who can make me forget I&#039;m reading a book, I can never enjoy their work in quite the same way again. There have been a few authors who have shocked me so much with their rudeness (inc homophobic/racist comments) that I will no longer recommend their books to customers. (In the interest of maintaining some amount of professionalism I will never actively discourage someone from buying their books, I just will not guide people to them unprompted).]]></description>
