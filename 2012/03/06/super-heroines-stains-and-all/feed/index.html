					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still a fan of the Batwoman monthly in the new 52, but I think it really does miss Rucka&#039;s writing. It moves a lot more slowly, although J. H. Williams&#039; art goes a long way to make it feel like you&#039;re inhabiting every minute. It&#039;s also kind of amusing to read it as basically the same as it would have been before the new 52. Which speaks really well of Kate Kane--she was new continuity before the new continuity even existed. :)]]></description>

Excellent writing! I haven&#039;t picked up a comic book in a very long time, but after reading this
I just might have to visit the local comic book shop!]]></description>

Knowing your tastes, Pete, I suspect you would be completely wowed by the design of the Batwoman art, but blown away by the story in Stumptown. Not that Stumptown is any schlub design-wise either. Even the paper the hardcover is printed on is perfectly chosen and adds to the experience of reading.]]></description>
