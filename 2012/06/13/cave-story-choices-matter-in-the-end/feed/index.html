Oh, well if you&#039;re talking walkthroughs to circumvent difficult gameplay situations, I&#039;m totally on board! Today&#039;s games are definitely better, as you mentioned, at guiding the player, but they can still be tricky. And older games -- whew, am I glad we have guides for some of those. ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2012/06/13/cave-story-choices-matter-in-the-end/#comment-3840&quot;&gt;Stephanie&lt;/a&gt;.

I have strongly mixed feelings about the information available online -- on the one hand, it really does seem to enable gamers seeking a shortcut to a &quot;perfect playthrough,&quot; and I&#039;ll admit to having given in to that temptation more than once. On the other hand, I have a lot of memories from when I was younger of games like &lt;i&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Maniac Mansion&lt;/i&gt; where I would hit a point where I simply didn&#039;t know what it was I needed to do next, and I just couldn&#039;t find the right NPC in the game or hadn&#039;t made some connection that the game expected me to make on my own.

The irony, perhaps, is that most games aren&#039;t built like that anymore -- they&#039;re a lot better at leading you where they want you to go while making it look like a player choice (see: the &lt;i&gt;Half Life&lt;/i&gt; games), and there&#039;s still a walkthrough or a strategy guide that&#039;ll make even that unnecessary.

It&#039;s a strange world. I (almost) never felt like I needed a guide in &lt;i&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/i&gt;, and yet I can&#039;t entirely imagine playing &lt;i&gt;Final Fantasy XIII&lt;/i&gt; without one. (There are just so many intricacies to the boss battles, and too many quirks that I can&#039;t really imagine figuring out on my own. &quot;Oh, you just stand there and let him hit you. &lt;i&gt;Of course.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;)

And given how little choice is involved in &lt;i&gt;FFXIII&lt;/i&gt;, that seems rather wrong.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[PS: I really like this blog&#039;s motto: &quot;refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy.&quot; I recently felt like I was devoting too much energy on my own site to video game-related things, but games are such a big part of my life. I shouldn&#039;t have to apologize. Thanks for inspiring me!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post! I can agree with both camps, but growing up, I played a game without knowing about the alternate paths I could have taken or the extras I could have found had I looked. Now we have a little convenience called the Internet, and gamers are easily spoiled. I&#039;d rather play through a game once and be happy with whatever outcome I get. If the game is good enough, and I want to reply for the sheer joy of the experience, then there&#039;s nothing wrong with wanting to take advantage of the variety a game offers. Even then, I prefer to discover it naturally, rather than read a guide and follow a set sequence of events to achieve a certain result.]]></description>
