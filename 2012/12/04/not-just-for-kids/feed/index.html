					<description><![CDATA[I only just got my hands on Planetary volume 4 yesterday, and highly recommend the whole thing. If you&#039;re looking for more &quot;literary&quot; comics, I&#039;m a big fan of Adrian Tomine -- his collections &quot;Summer Blonde&quot; and &quot;Shortcomings&quot; are like if early, alcoholic Raymond Carver had been a millennial and written comics. Rich, bleak, depressing, and masterfully done. Alan Moore&#039;s &quot;Watchmen&quot; is essential reading -- it&#039;s possibly the most literary superhero story ever done -- and his &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; series does something sort of similar to Planetary, but with an entirely different tone and set (mostly) at the tail end of the 19th century instead of the 20th.

I&#039;ll second Greg Rucka&#039;s &quot;Batwoman: Elegy.&quot; It&#039;s simply one of the best, most beautifully drawn, most rounded mainstream comics stories of the past few years. Rucka and Ed Brubaker&#039;s &quot;Gotham Central&quot; series is also amazing. (I wrote about it here on The Idler a while ago.) 

But more than anything, get to CADL! Lansing&#039;s library has an amazing set of comics collections available to check out. They have most or all of what I&#039;ve listed above, and probably most of the other recommendations here as well.]]></description>

I&#039;ve heard of Bone, I think we had it in the kid&#039;s section where I worked, not that that means it can&#039;t be awesome. :) I liked the artwork in it.]]></description>

Sword of Sorcery sounds good, I&#039;ve been looking for something to fill the Game of Thrones void in my life. I&#039;ll have to head out to my local shops and see what&#039;s available.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Agree muchly with Barbara&#039;s suggestion of Bone.

This past weekend, I picked up a few trades. Two were gifts. They&#039;re both by Brian K. Vaughn, and they&#039;re both pretty grand: Runaways v1 and Saga v1. Also picked up Planetary v1-3, and you&#039;re welcome to borrow if you&#039;d like.

For light reading, Runaways is pretty win. Also, if you can find it, the Middleman is pretty awesome (as was the tv adaptation).

The Boys is great, but doesn&#039;t really fit the bill for what you&#039;re looking for right now. The same is true of Irredeemable and the Walking Dead.

Warren Ellis&#039; Freakangels is pretty good and readable on the interwebs for free: http://www.freakangels.com

Transmetropolitan, also by Ellis, is also quite good, ableit a bit batshit insane at times.

As much as I disliked the massive character shift, I&#039;ll admit the the Alan Moore-penned Supreme books were worth reading. I think I have the trades somewhere.

I&#039;ll dig through my big box this weekend and see if I have anything I can salvage for you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a big Marvel/DC reader, so I&#039;ll give you some alternatives that you might enjoy:
Jeff Smith&#039;s Bone, Craig Thompson&#039;s Good-bye Chunky Rice, Brian Ralph&#039;s Daybreak, Love and Rockets by the Hernandez brothers, Lynda Barry&#039;s One Hundred Demons, Jessica Abel&#039;s La Perdida and Life Sucks, Colleen Doran&#039;s A Distant Soil, It&#039;s a Good Life If You Don&#039;t Weaken by Seth. And lots of other books by Drawn and Quarterly, Fantagraphics, Top Shelf Productions and First Second Books, basically. There&#039;s just too much, so see what you like of the stuff I&#039;ve mentioned and let me know if you want more suggestions ;-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh my oh my. *rubs hands together* This is my area of expertise.

Of all the things I&#039;ve written about for the Idler, I&#039;d recommend Batman (current run by Scott Snyder), Batgirl (current run by Gail Simone) and Batwoman (any, particularly Batwoman: Elegy by Greg Rucka) the most for super-hero fare. All are available in initial collections and recent issues can be found at your local comic shop. 

Sandman is an always classic choice, but I would also point you towards Fables and Sweet Tooth. Fables may seem daunting (volume 18 just came out), but all collections are readily available online and in stores. Sweet Tooth is just ending its monthly run, so starting at the beginning would be no daunting task. 

And if you like Game of Thrones, and want to hit a local comic shop, I&#039;d try Sword of Sorcery by DC Comics. Only 3 issues have been out and it&#039;s a great read. It is also readily available through Comixology.com and its iPad/tablet app.

Can&#039;t wait to hear what you choose!]]></description>
