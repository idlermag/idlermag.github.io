					<description><![CDATA[I think this is part of the problem with the perception that counting calories has to be about restriction and not eating anything you want to eat. For me, counting calories or using any sort of eating plan (currently Weight Watchers) has never been about not eating what I want to eat or not going out with friends. Does food measurement have to be obsessively accurate to make a difference? Not really, but being close helps. Over time I&#039;ve just started to learn how much things are worth. This doesn&#039;t mean I never eat a hamburger or fries. It just means that I&#039;m more aware of what a hamburger and fries twice a day is &quot;worth.&quot; I think the key is just better awareness, especially for me. 

Because the thing is that if I don&#039;t keep track of what I&#039;m eating, I eat twice as much as I need to eat. I rationalize poor choices because I &quot;forget&quot; that I already had two sandwiches for lunch. I don&#039;t actually need a huge amount of food to not feel hungry. If I go over one day, whatever. You won&#039;t see me not going out to lunch or dinner because I&#039;m counting points or calories, though, that&#039;s for sure. Getting obsessive just doesn&#039;t work in the long run. 

Anyway, I think the point is to find a balance between being obsessive and being aware. For me, that happens when I&#039;m tracking what I eat by some sort of method, be it calories or points. It doesn&#039;t break my heart if I go overboard on the occasion, but I definitely feel better than when I ate indiscriminately. 

Also, I &#060;3 you. And I have too many opinions on this subject. My b!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Extremely well said, Jill. Obviously it&#039;s good to make healthy choices that give your body strength and energy, but there&#039;s no reason a diet should exclude you from living a full life. Whenever I feel bad about my food choices, I try to remember that I&#039;d rather have the memory of spending time with friends over sangria than the memory of staying home just to avoid the calories.]]></description>
