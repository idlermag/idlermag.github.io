					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;My understanding of the Doctor is that he’s always been a do-gooder. Traveling through time, righting wrongs, helping civilizations evolve — that’s the Doctor’s schtick.&lt;/em&gt;

Well, not quite.  In his very earliest episodes in 1963-65 he was an arrogant, grumpy, ill-tempered old man who initially tried to avoid helping people if he could.  He kidnapped his first companions to prevent them from reporting his existence.   He even tried to kill a helpless, unconscious opponent by smashing him on the head with a rock, and his companions had to stop him.

&lt;em&gt;Dr. Song almost immediately exhibits more ingenuity in how to do the things the Doctor does, from uses for the sonic screwdriver to how to appropriately pilot the TARDIS.&lt;/em&gt;

To be fair, her mother (no, her other mother) is the TARDIS.]]></description>
