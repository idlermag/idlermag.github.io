					<description><![CDATA[Really enjoyed your article and was heartened to see that your first in person F1 race turning out to be a ludicrous 6 car parade did not dampen your enthusiasm for the sport (my first was the 1966 USGP and luckily I did not go to Indy that year). I thought it very well written but can&#039;t help pointing out one really glaring error:

&quot; Some of these turns can be taken at high speed, but most are best navigated at around 45 mph.&quot;

most corners &#060;75 kph? No, indeed very few are.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t count how many times I&#039;ve had to explain to friends that Formula One is not the same as the indy series. Reading this article makes me feel a little less alone. There are kindred spirits out there. I&#039;ve been a devoted fan for about a decade, but haven&#039;t met anyone as devout as the good Dr. Hanman. She is brilliant. This article is spot on. Well done Dr.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amid the endless column inches devoted to Formula 1&#039;s politics and technology - both in print and online - it&#039;s a genuine treat to read a well written article by an avid and knowledgeable F1 enthusiast (with content directed towards other enthusiasts, new and old) in which the author is openly celebrating the pleasures of all that F1 brings to its audience. A wonderful and welcome breath of fresh air. More please. Congratulations, Erin. All best wishes, Steve Matchett.]]></description>
