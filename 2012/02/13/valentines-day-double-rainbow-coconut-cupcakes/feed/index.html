					<description><![CDATA[I LOVE BAKEITINACAKE.COM! Your cupcakes look beautiful and delicious. Too bad I can&#039;t morally ask you to frost freeze one and mail it my way, but know that I wish I could! 

Last year, I made these suckers http://bakeitinacake.com/post/17387909491/bake-a-heart-into-a-cake-if-youre-too-shy-to. The only problem was that I had to remember which way the heart was facing so that when people bit into it, they actually saw a heart and not just a red blob!

Happy Valentine&#039;s Day!]]></description>
