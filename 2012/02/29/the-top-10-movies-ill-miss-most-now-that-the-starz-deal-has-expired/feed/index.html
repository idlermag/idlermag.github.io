					<description><![CDATA[Hey, nice list!  I agree with all of those movies with the exception of Gnomeo and Juliet.  Although it wasn’t a waste of my life, I could say I could have lived without it.  I guess that is the beauty of all you can watch services; if you don’t like something, stop watching and try something else.  I intend to order the best DVD and Blu-ray movies I can, but sometimes there is a stinker.  I love having streaming too with my Blockbuster @Home because I can supplement when I don’t have a game rented.  Oh, I also watch a movie on one of my 20 HD-commercial free movie channels I get too, which I record on my DVR for later.  Actually, only ten dollars a month is nice since it would be nearly twice that much for Netflix, and I don’t mind paying it even as a DISH employee.]]></description>
