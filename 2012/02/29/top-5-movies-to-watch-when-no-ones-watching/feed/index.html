					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2012/02/29/top-5-movies-to-watch-when-no-ones-watching/#comment-3210&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, I guess because even though it&#039;s very self-aware to begin with, the issues it critiques collapse in on themselves.  I think a lot of people love Fight Club for all it&#039;s radicalism but then feel content to simply quote Fight Club and reference their knowledge of the film to brand themselves as edgy and counterculture.  That&#039;s pretty much the same kind of contented laziness we&#039;re supposed to hate according to the movie&#039;s logic.  Beyond that, I think just the fact that it&#039;s uber violent and male-centered makes me feel like it&#039;s a guilty pleasure.  I&#039;ve written about the film and book quite a bit in grad school and I always always get questioned about &quot;how can you like this with it&#039;s view toward women or lack of women?&quot;  I&#039;ve also been questioned about it&#039;s literary quality--like it&#039;s not lit enough for English study.  I don&#039;t necessarily agree with the assumptions behind those questions, but they make me feel guilty that I love the film so much.  Hope that answers your question.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dont understand how you see fight club as a &#039;guilty pleasure&#039; its a brilliant film and stays fantastically true to the novel and i dont know anyone who would be embarrassed to be caught watching it, at no point in the article do you actually explain why you count it as a guilty pleasure so i was hoping you maybe could clear that up for me?]]></description>
