										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Detroit Tigers third baseman, catcher, centerfielder, oh-hell-put-him-anywhere-and-he&#8217;ll-play guy Brandon Inge was called up from the Tigers&#8217; Triple-A affiliate in Toledo to join the starting lineup against left-handed pitchers. A ringing endorsement, I know. Inge was assigned to Toledo earlier this season when his hitting, never stellar, totally bottomed out &#8212; .177 in 239 appearances at the plate.</p>
<p>In Inge&#8217;s first at-bat after rejoining the Tigers, <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011108210617" target="_blank">he hit a home run</a>.</p>
<p>Inge is the kind of player fans either love or hate, often, I think for the same reasons. He&#8217;s only ever played for the Tigers, which is either a sign of loyalty or that Inge isn&#8217;t good enough to play anywhere else. He was a member of the 2003 team that lost more games than any other in the history of the American League, which gives his presence on a team making a playoff run this year a feeling of redemption, or every time he walks to the dugout after striking out serves as a reminder of that team&#8217;s failures. At his best at the plate, he&#8217;s a mediocre hitter, with little power and control who strikes out too much. He participated in the 2009 Home Run Derby and didn&#8217;t hit a single home run. At his best in the field, he&#8217;s a miracle. It&#8217;s a crime that he&#8217;s never won a Golden Glove.</p>
<p>For me, Inge is the last remaining piece of an old puzzle, a link both to the worst Tigers team I ever watched and to the team I&#8217;ve loved more than any other. He played with Bobby Higginson and Dimitri Young. Pudge Rodriguez, who was the first well-paid piece of the Tigers post-2003 rebuilding puzzle, took Inge&#8217;s spot as catcher. He played with Justin Verlander, Magglio Ordóñez, Sean Casey, Curtis Granderson, Kenny Rogers, and Joel Zumaya in 2006. Casey and Rogers were gone the next year. Zumaya has been the walking wounded most of the time since then. Granderson was traded to New York in 2009. Inge is still around.</p>
<p>It may not be for that much longer, and when Inge is done with the Tigers, he&#8217;ll be done for good. Nobody wanted to trade for Inge when Miguel Cabrera took over his spot at third base in 2008. (Inge didn&#8217;t even get his spot back when Cabrera moved to first base, and Carlos Guillén, who was useless at first base, got the chance to be useless at third.) No one picked up Inge on waivers when he was assigned to Toledo. It&#8217;s entirely possible that Inge is too expensive: not enough offense, and defense that will get worse and not better with each passing year.</p>
<p>Even I&#8217;m not romantic enough to say that he deserves a spot just because he seems to be a really great guy, a true professional who has taken everything the team has thrown at him, played everywhere &#8212; <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011108140561" target="_blank">and I mean everywhere</a> &#8212; they&#8217;ve asked him to play. Granderson was a great guy too, and I think trading him was the right move. The Tigers know what they&#8217;re doing, and when Inge really doesn&#8217;t have anything left to offer, they&#8217;ll pay out his contract and let him go. I&#8217;ll be sad, even if it&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to enjoy it while he&#8217;s here, as long as it lasts.</p>

If you&#8217;re a hockey fan (as I am) you know that a playoff beard is part of standard lore, and you probably looked forward to seeing the usually clean-shaven Steve Yzerman slowly become a bit scruffier, or the perpetually stubbled Brendan Shanahan turn into a grizzly bear overnight.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s in a beard?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a hockey fan (as I am) you know that a playoff beard is part of standard lore, and you probably looked forward to seeing the usually clean-shaven Steve Yzerman slowly become a bit scruffier, or the perpetually stubbled Brendan Shanahan turn into a grizzly bear overnight.</p>
<p>The Tigers are noticeable lacking in the facial hair department, and it&#8217;s not (as far as I am aware) due to any Steinbrenner-esque rules (no visible tats, no facial hair, steroids and cheating okay). </p>
<p>Earlier in the season, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/04/12/in-which-i-have-had-it-up-to-here/">I bitched and moaned</a> about the Tigers not playing with any sense of urgency, and there seemingly being no clubhouse leader to smack their asses into line. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I&#8217;ve been proven wrong.</p>
<p>Enter Alex Avila.</p>
<p>When he was called up at the end of the 2009 season, Alex was money. </p>
<p>In 61 at-bats, Alex launched 5 homeruns, batted .279 and walked ten times. His slugging percentage, on-base percentage and OPS were impressive too: .375/.590/.965, respectively.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Avila was only 22 at the time.</p>
<p>Since then, he has called Armando Galarraga&#8217;s (near) perfect game and, this weekend, Justin Verlander&#8217;s second career no-hitter. </p>
<p>His stats are impressive, but more so, he&#8217;s starting to remind me of Big Wheel&mdash;Lance Parrish, so named because he was the big wheel in the Tiger&#8217;s championship machine.</p>
<p>What makes Avila, at the tender age of 24, the second coming of Lance?</p>
<p>Check out his new facial hair. While he&#8217;s always had the perpetual 5 o&#8217;clock shadow,<a href="http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/2/275353219001/275353219001_922924438001_vs-922920433001.jpg?pubId=275353219001" target="_blank"> he&#8217;s now sporting a rather counter-trendy goatee</a>.</p>
<p>Then, he said this: We&#8217;re too good to be playing like this.</p>
<p>Mind you, he&#8217;s right, and mind you, no one else bothered to say it. Calling your teammates out to the press? That&#8217;s what a leader, or a douchebag, does. How do you know which Alex is?</p>
<p><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=14417199&amp;tcid=fb_det_14417199&amp;c_id=det" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s check the video evidence.</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Kid takes Andruw Jones out at the plate. He sets up for a collision and DOES. NOT. BUDGE. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? Is that the sound of Avila putting his money where his mouth is?</p>
<p>Yes. And you&#8217;ll notice the Tigers have been a different team lately. A team with a leader, who is only 24 years old&mdash;a lot like someone else who grew an okay beard every now and then. Stevie Y, anyone?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, my Monday team, the MIRS Muckrakers, played like the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p>By that I mean the Detroit Tigers of the Alan Trammell era&mdash;the Alan-as-manager era, when I just wanted to hug (and gently smack) him when he would lament, post-game, “We just had that one bad inning.”</p>
<p>For us, it was the first inning. We were up to bat first and promptly went down in order; I, at the #2 spot, hitting the first pitch and not, as my coach would say, using my lower half. (I’d have the same problem during at bat #2, but AB #3 was much better&mdash;to the tune of a hit that felt about 60% right.)</p>
<p>Then, the defense.</p>
<p>Mind you, we were playing Team Hooah, which is the sound you make in the Army when something is awesome (“Hooah, motherfuckers, we just killed bin Laden!”), when you’re driving a point home, when you’re happy, sad, silly, etc. It’s a much more badass version of &#8220;smurf.&#8221; </p>
<p>So Team Hooah is good. They’re a National Guard team, and a few years back, we had to reschedule our late-season games with them because they were deploying. As you can imagine, we didn’t need to spot them any runs. We didn’t need to give them a hand. </p>
<p>But we did, to the tune of NINE RUNS in the first inning.  </p>
<p>As Alex Avila said of his own under-performing team, We are too good to play like this. (Some other day I’ll have a whole separate column on Alex, because there’s so much to love about him: his perpetual five o’clock shadow, the way he calls pitches without dugout help, how he called the perfect game and Armando didn’t shake him off, how he can be, finally, the leader the Tigers need.)</p>
<p>When we lost 19-9, I felt just like I felt watching the Tigers from 1989-2005, and 2007-present. We’re too good to play like this. But it’s only the first game of the season, right, and we’re all a bit rusty or nervous or whatever.</p>
<p>And, really, now that the news of bin Laden’s death has settled, I am feeling a little overcome with compassion for our armed forces, many of whom don’t get lazy evening ballgames or full seasons or even a cup of tea, the television and Monday night baseball on ESPN. </p>
<p>It kind of doesn’t feel right to bitch about my just-for-fun team booting balls and missing plays and dropping outs. (Lucky bastards. I was HOT after the game!)</p>
<p>I said “Thanks,” to every member of Team Hooah as they passed, because, fuck it, our one bad inning was better than any day in Baghdad or Kabul or even Ft. Sill, OK. I’ve got it pretty easy. I’m not fighting PTSD and nightmares and the horrible memories (and withdrawals of powerful adrenaline highs that can’t be replicated in normal life) of war. </p>
<p>I’m bitching because no one else seems to want to do what it takes to win as much as I do. Maybe I feel a little cosmically twinned with the military that way. So hey, nice game, Team Hooah. It was a privilege to have our asses kicked by men and women of honor.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a day after Valentine&#8217;s, and all I can think about is how much I love the Tigers.</em></p>
<p><strong>LOVE LETTER POSTMARKED MICHIGAN AND TRUMBALL</strong></p>
<p>It’s the legs I fall in love with,<br />
the high knee socks and pants stopping<br />
just at the crest of calf<br />
small bay of knee.</p>
<p>They’re Brandon Inge’s legs<br />
sublime and twitchy at third base</p>
<p>the shudder in Abuelito’s walk<br />
the limp when he shuffled into the Loma<br />
with a mistress at his hip</p>
<p>wondering how I’d have been so surprised<br />
when the man I love with the knees<br />
made of glass<br />
betrayed me.</p>
<p>I must have fallen in love with<br />
Abuelito first, then Lance Parrish,<br />
and now these Tigers</p>
<p>the way every woman in my family<br />
has learned to love any man</p>
<p>stumbling over the positives<br />
(“we were in almost every game”)</p>
<p>waiting for next year<br />
it could always be so much worse<br />
as a friend says, “we could all have one leg.”</p>
<p>Oh, Abuelito, teaching me<br />
to love the lost men before I knew<br />
he was among them</p>
<p>to love them even more the further they went away<br />
when one could only listen through the radio<br />
in the driveway of the old house on Fairmont<br />
Ernie Harwell forever notching the scores</p>
<p>his lovely wife Lulu eternally waiting at home<br />
with dinner still warm</p>
<p>losses stepping upon losses</p>
<p>like the bricks of the new ballpark.</p>
<p>How I waited for them for years<br />
and they couldn’t even<br />
set the record<br />
for most losses in one season</p>
<p>because that, in its own way, would be<br />
a kind of win.</p>
<p>But it’s smaller&mdash;the man at the plate<br />
when every out is a war<br />
and every strike a reason to leave<br />
and every pitch, my love, is a weak ankle<br />
shattering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cardinal Dreams</strong></p>
<p>1.<br />
Firebird, Thunderbird, Sunbird<br />
they all seemed the same to me<br />
their headlights like eyes<br />
unmoving, blank.  </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Phoenix Center in downtown Pontiac,<br />
somewhere near the Fiero plant and Fischer Body<br />
where Johnny Cash worked three weeks<br />
alongside Abuelito, building the 1951 models. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Johnny Cash joining the Air Force, Abuelito’s<br />
old Aztec thunderbird medallion curling<br />
into his chest hair<br />
those years after the war,<br />
open shirt, asleep on the couch<br />
with the afternoon game on, his mammoth<br />
cherries jubilee Cadillac parked in the driveway, </p>
<p>4.<br />
four years old when he jumps off<br />
the couch and the Tigers take the World Series,<br />
tugging at his pant leg<br />
and repeating what I think is the name<br />
of his automobile </p>
<p>5.<br />
car-din-al. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Once I dreamed a cardinal:<br />
on a power line<br />
bisecting a dying oak<br />
in the front yard of the home<br />
I was leaving</p>
<p>Sean Casey’s calf muscle snapping<br />
as a taut electrical wire in Game Two</p>
<p>my Abuelita when she discovered<br />
the crimson lipstick of her husband’s mistress. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Like a skipping record for days, for weeks<br />
I look out the front window<br />
of the house on Allen St.<br />
three perfectly equal wooden frames<br />
stained dark a hundred years before<br />
spinning tires.</p>
<p>8.<br />
Through the wood<br />
of the frames/ through the glass and the branches<br />
of the three story oak to the transmission lines<br />
on the other side – it is the same every time. </p>
<p>One cardinal</p>
<p>motionless</p>
<p>balanced on a wire. </p>
<p>9.<br />
In the dream is it clear, the facts are unquestionable:<br />
I’ve seen this same bird,<br />
	fixing its tiny<br />
	repeating record eyes on me until I wake,<br />
hundreds of times/</p>
<p>I cannot remember<br />
if I’ve seen the bird/<br />
awake. </p>
<p>10.<br />
It’s the baseball day-<br />
dreams, the two hands of Albert Pujols,<br />
the St. Louis Cardinal </p>
<p>smiling across his jersey, his hands still<br />
as the pitcher begins his motion,<br />
the sublime strain of fabric<br />
along quadriceps.</p>
<p>He’s a man you love even when he breaks you<br />
when the Cardinals take the Series in five<br />
and we go home alone.</p>
<p>12.<br />
The cherries and the cars and the<br />
bird and the tugging were all the same, were all real<br />
or not real, were all some kind of way </p>
<p>to explain what had happened/ what had maybe<br />
never happened, but I cannot speak<br />
when I try to say it, lusting after Pujols </p>
<p>and alone at night and wearing patent red<br />
shoes, imagining myself as Mercury<br />
with the winged heels when I chase the bus,<br />
waving a hand looking into each passing branch.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, if you&#8217;ve ever doubted the wisdom of Dombo (not to be confused with the elephant, Dumbo) let this ease your mind.</p>
<p>So the Nationals, another National League club, <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=4262">plunked down an almost unthinkable amount of money for a guy who has never managed to break .300 on the season</a>. And yes, I know that he&#8217;s come close, but if I&#8217;m going to sign a guy to a deal like that&mdash;7 years, $126 million&mdash;I am certainly not going to go all-in on a guy who can&#8217;t break .300 in the NL.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Miguel Cabrera money, but <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=5544">Werth is not putting up Miguel Cabrera numbers in the column that matters most: RBIs</a>.</p>
<p>You want a guy who only hits homers when it doesn&#8217;t matter, or the bases are empty, sign Marcus Thames to a league-minimum deal. You want a guy who&#8217;s not going to choke when you&#8217;ve got runners ready to score? Then Werth is not really your man.</p>
<p>So why is Dombo right to have never even entered the Werth sweepstakes? </p>
<p>Because Werth is a lot like a guy who got a similar contract recently: <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=5940">Matt Holliday</a>.</p>
<p>And when you look at Holliday&#8217;s numbers, you see a pretty obvious trend. When he&#8217;s played in the NL, he&#8217;s been above .300 every year save one&mdash;and that year, he hit .290. But for the half-season he was in Oakland, he hit .286&mdash;worse than his rookie year. He&#8217;s traded to the Cards at midseason, and hits .386. </p>
<p>The worst thing that could have happened for the Tigers would have been a repeat of the Dontrell Willis experience, but with a hitter. Werth, I suspect, is a lot like Holliday, in that they&#8217;re very skilled (in Werth&#8217;s case, somewhat skilled) hitters in the NL, but in the AL. . . well, it&#8217;s better for Werth to stay in the NL. </p>
<p>I mean, look: Holliday had a ONE HUNDRED POINT SWING in his batting average. Just by switching leagues. Now, ok, maybe we can&#8217;t extrapolate that&mdash;it does seem too extreme to be a standard for players of Werth&#8217;s / Holliday&#8217;s ilk when switching to the AL, with it&#8217;s harder-to-master pitching&mdash;but even a fifty point drop would have been disaster.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the Tigers with a big money, big name free agent, who sometimes plays right field and struggles at the plate? And hits, what, .230? No, no you can&#8217;t. Even Johnny Damon, who was slightly disappointing, hit .270. </p>
<p>So who&#8217;s a better bet for the Tigers? There&#8217;s always <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=5035">Carl Crawford</a> who can hit, field, and run. (The Tigers would be wise to add a bona fide baserunner&mdash;teams like the Twins always kill us with the running game.) Or Jim Thome. Or, hey, Magglio Ordonez.</p>
<p>Don’t be sad, Tigers fans. We didn’t miss out on anything but a sure bust. I&#8217;m fairly certain that Werth will continue to nibble around the .300 mark this season, but he&#8217;s not going to make the Nats a contender. Of course, if I&#8217;m Dombo, and I&#8217;m wrong, I can always take solace in the $126 million I didn&#8217;t place on that bet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Watching the wonderful new installment of Ken Burn’s <em>Baseball</em> (the original, I sheepishly admit, I have yet to watch), <em>The Tenth Inning</em>, a player mentioned something similar: the chemistry comes when you’ve been winning together, when you are all bought into the plan, when the games get tough and you all&#8212; each of you&#8212;grind out each at-bat, each pitch, to get the right ball to hit and the hit that drives in the run that wins the game.

That kind of focus and workmanship has been missing from the Tigers since, well, 2006. And it’s the kind of thing you don’t get by building, or retaining, guys for amorphous reasons, like “He’s a veteran,” “He’s a leader,” or “The sound of the ball off his bat is different, like all the greatest hitters the game has ever known.”

So the Tigers have already announced who is not coming back&#8212;at least, not at this pay scale.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Leyland is famous (in my mind) not just for his mustache, but for busting up the most clichéd sporting myths with curt quotes. (Never mind that he’s responsible for some completely original epic inventions, like the time he said in a mid-inning interview that that sound of the ball coming off a great hitter’s bat just plain sounded different. Amazingly, he was talking about Craig Monroe, who, say what you will about where he is now [out of baseball], could evidently ring the distinct sounding sweet spot with the greatest hitters Jim had ever heard.)</p>
<p>Jim says team chemistry is overrated; give him a group of guys who can win together.</p>

So long, pal. so long.</p></div>Neither Magglio Ordoñez’s winning smile, spectacular hair or even the way he came back to trigger his option in 2009 with a stellar end of season is worth the price of this year’s option&mdash;$15 million. Of course we’ll all always remember fondly his walk-off homerun, which sent the hooded Placido Polanco galloping and celebrating around third, and sent the Tigers to the 2006 World Series. My money is on Brennan Boesch ironing out his late-season batting issues and winning the job in right field. If Magglio does re-sign, I bet he’ll be primarily a DH supporting the everyday RF.</p>
<p>Jeremy Bonderman hasn’t pitched a complete season that I can recall, either suffering a “dead arm” or a legit blood clot or some variation thereof. He’s got good stuff, but, as doomed former skipper Alan Trammel would say, it’s the one bad inning that gets him. Every start. Too bad for him the Tigers can get a starter who’ll be hurt often and give up tons-o-runs one inning each start for much, much less than Bondo’s recent rate. Some National League team will get him at a bargain rate, and he’ll probably become a 5th (maybe 4th) starter of note. He’s welcome to Spring Training if he doesn’t catch on anywhere else, and if that happens, I think the bullpen is an option.</p>
<p>And goodbye Johnny Damon, whose single most important contribution to the team in this, his single year as a Tiger, was not his spirited defense of the city of Detroit as he spurned the waiver wire advances of the Boston Red Sox, but the time he convinced the bullpen, a few starters and some other position players to trim their locks into Mohawks. Wouldn’t it be great if he ended up back with the Royals? Or the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he could pick on National League pitching and hang out with new manager Kirk Gibson?</p>

I like long at-bats and turning two. Call me. Or my agent.</p></div>Probably Carlos Guillen should pack his bags too. Despite his willingness to play anywhere (platooning in the outfield, short stop, second, first when Cabrera was originally signed and then third when Cabs moved to first and no one wanted to apologize to Brandon Inge and put him back at the hot corner) microfracture surgery&mdash;which he had after the hard “break up the double play” slide that sent him to the DL&mdash;is no joke. It’s not promising to have anything in common with Greg Oden (well, ok, maybe ONE thing), and his creaky knees are probably never going to improve. Besides, I’d rather see Will “Busta” Rhymes and Scott “Don’t Call Me Grady” Sizemore have a metaphorical knife-fight for the right to play second. Frankly, I’d rather see Cabrera and Inge as the team elders, and the payroll down substantially to make room for a few new guys.</p>
<p>It looks like we can say welcome back to Jhonny Peralta and Brandon Inge (barring a contract impasse). Dave Dombrowski says the Tigs won’t chase a Cliff Lee-caliber player, but they’re looking for rotation slots 3/4/5 to be filled. One with Phil Coke. (And his spectacular sideburns.)</p>
<p>Perhaps in the coming months we’ll have signed Carl “The Perfect Storm” Crawford (ohpleaseohpleaseohplease), gotten word that Joel Zumaya will never be hurt again (I’m saying rosaries for that one) and maybe, just maybe, I’ll finally get a call back about being the Tigers bench coach. </p>
<p>One just can’t say for certain. But it will be something to look forward to, to tide us through the winter.</p>
<p>Quick hit playoff picks:</p>

Yankees in six, with A-Rod doing something douche-tastic in the fourth game.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Giants will fall prey to The Curse Of Barry Bonds’ Jerkism (and paying way too much money for Barry Zito) and will be dispatched by the Braves. Braves in 5.</p>
<p>In a battle of sweet red uniforms (my personal favorite) the Reds and the Phillies will take it to seven games. Much as it pains me to say this (because the Phillies are my National League team) the Reds will take game 7. Tear.</p>
<p>Everything is bigger in Texas, including the hype. A rookie closer and Josh Hamilton’s sore ribs won’t be much more than a speed bump for Carl Crawford, Evan Longoria and Matt Garza. These boys know how to win, and they grind it out. Rays in 5. Four if Longoria has a beard.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s the seasonal equivalent of Sunday dread, that moment as the last of the weekend turns into the first of the work week (or, years ago, fresh seven days of school) when you begin to feel your entire life weigh heavily upon you. Somewhere recently I read that Sunday dread is the bit of evening where you are nearly smothered by the choices you’ve made, and the doubts you have about them – should I have gone to grad school when I was young? Is it too late to become President? Why didn’t I try harder in fifth grade? Will we ever be the people living in the same neighborhood as Tom Izzo?

It's when September is just about out of days and the Tigers, God bless them, are officially, mathematically, scientific-method tested and retested and confirmed, out of the playoff picture. Again.

Is it too late to become President? Why didn’t I try harder in fifth grade? Will we ever be the people living in the same neighborhood as Tom Izzo?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s when September is just about out of days and the Tigers, God bless them, are officially, mathematically, scientific-method tested and retested and confirmed, out of the playoff picture. Again.</p>
<p>But it’s more than the end of the season. It’s the constant reminder of Opening Day, the (irrational) amount of hope and optimism gurgling north during Spring Training in the dispatches from the beat reporters in Lakeland. It’s the same as catching a whiff of summer even as the maple leaves are scratching across your shoelaces.</p>
<p>Austin Jackson comes to the plate, and it’s impossible to forget his first games, his first hits. Watching the Tigers dismantle the Twins this past weekend (ten runs? Where did that come from?) of course stirs up the same emotions roiling us off the couch and high-fiving in front of the television, exclaiming to no one when the boys would come back in the bottom of the ninth and you were listening to the game on the radio, covered in garden soil, spade raised triumphantly. </p>
<p>And yet it’s all tinged a little sepia, something like watching a film knowing the end will be tragic. The Tigers will take the series from the Twins, it will be impressive, it will be so much like June and those hot nights when Miguel Cabrera just seemed to will the team to win, when even Eddie Bonine had nasty pitches working and the bullpen was not what opposing hitters wanted to face.</p>
<p>It’s the Sunday dread, the nostalgia and the promise all still present – the taste of watermelon on the breeze when you’re buttoning your coat – and all somehow failed. The fabulous home record, the road trip disasters. The injuries, the sense of having wasted something – something perfect like 26 outs, something perfect like a Rookie of the Year season paired with an MVP. </p>
<p>We know what’s coming. The cold, the long tucking in until the snow drains away, the months of rumors and innuendo and tough decisions we can spend this moment, next year, second guessing. </p>
<p>Still, it’s not quite time. The Tigers might be getting ready to hibernate, but baseball isn’t finished. There’s an entire month left of hot tea on the couch, windows open, blankets swathing feet. Maybe it’ll be harder to burst from that cocoon while watching the playoffs, but if it’ll stave off the Sunday dread-esque feeling of knowing it’s almost time to tuck the cleats away, you better believe I’m ready to bring out my Phillies hat.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it’s the Robert Fick jersey popping up at a road game, or a talking head mentioning the time Shane Halter played all nine positions in one game. Sometimes it’s my brother reminding me of the guy I dated that one summer who looked like Rich Becker, or how the name Chad Kreuter seemed to us as children both vaguely pornographic and slightly B-movie horror madman-esque.

However they’re called up, the specters of the players we grew up with (and had perhaps even entirely forgotten about until they were invoked, like disembodied voices at a séance) still linger near the dirt of the on-deck circle, exist, somehow, side by side with Miguel Cabrera even though maybe they’re now living in Florida or running a limo company or imprisoned in South America.

So when Binge (B + Inge = Binge, and describes, for this fan, his feast-or-famine approach to offense) poked one through the infield, turning his all-time hits ticker from 999 to 1000, it was only fitting that the leading edge of Bobby Higginson’s right forearm could be seen as his transparent self marked a cautious lead at third, his whole mouth stuffed with Big League chew and, of course, that fabulous goatee meticulously trimmed.

<p>And why wouldn’t Higgy be there? He’d played with Inge since the day Brandon made it up from the minors in 2001. They slogged through terrible seasons together, including the back-to-back 106- and 119-loss seasons. Higginson, who exited the game quietly in 2005, playing just 10 games and retiring in the offseason, was the last Tiger to get 1000 hits with the team.</p>
<p>Maybe it was something like unfinished business that kept the five-years-ago Higgy haunting the base paths.</p>
<p>When Higginson hung up his cleats, he did so without ever having a winning season under his belt, let alone having the success of the following season, when the Tigers tore through their opponents like some kind of nuclear disaster and entered the World Series as the best Cinderella story since the Boston Red Sox a few years prior. </p>
<p>I don’t know why, but he seems to be hanging around the edges of major league baseball lately. </p>
<p>Higgy is a Philadelphia native, and when the Phillies’ Roy Halladay tossed a perfect game this season, sharp fans were quick to note that Halladay took a no-hitter into the 9th on September 27, 1998, when the intended third out, Higginson, broke it up with a home run.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the way Higginson sort of disappeared slowly, like Marty McFly’s hand. Maybe it’s the silence, the lack of a formal announcement preserved in the annals of the internet, the full page ad in Detroit papers, thanking the fans, which we all remember him placing but seems to occupy a disintegrated sheaf of newsprint I cannot find record of now.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s got something to do with the fact that he hasn’t said a word about the Tigers since he retired, and he certainly hasn’t been brought back to the ballpark except by fans like me, who swear they see him swaggering out of the dugout on his way to left field.</p>
<p>It’s the same as the backyard game, playing short teams and calling for ghost runners. Even though you’d just been there, standing on third, and now you were knocking the bat against the soles of your shoes, you could still see your forty-seconds-ago self out of the corner of your eye, getting a lead. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[First Joel Zumaya’s beautiful right elbow went supernova, a truly sickening thing to watch in real time, as I did, tearing up because I just want to hug the boy and tell him, it’s ok, son, you’ve got one more brutal recovery and storybook comeback in you. 

Then in rapid succession: Brandon Inge (fractured hand) Magglio Ordonez (broken ankle) and Carlos Guillen (calf strain) fall like dominos, as though they were all single file on the third base line, just waiting their turn.

Which brings us to now. Take a look at <a target="new" href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=300829114">Sunday’s starting lineup</a> for the Bless You Boys:

A Jackson CF
W Rhymes 2B
R Raburn LF
M Cabrera 1B
J Peralta SS
B Inge 3B
B Boesch DH
C Wells RF
A Avila C

It’s Miggy and the minors!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A funny thing happened to the Detroit Tigers after the All-Star break – something that seems to happen to some degree every year around this time, as <a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/joshlandon/status/19788124516">@joshlandon</a> noted, though I am not certain it involves Jim Leyland taking the boys to Tijuana for hookers and coke.</p>
<p>After making most of the American League Central look confused, outplayed and sometimes embarrassingly outclassed the first half of the season, the Tigers can’t buy a win. At least this time there’s a pretty obvious culprit: the dreaded injury bug.</p>

<p>Then in rapid succession: Brandon Inge (fractured hand) Magglio Ordonez (broken ankle) and Carlos Guillen (calf strain) fall like dominos, as though they were all single file on the third base line, just waiting their turn. Johnny Damon’s been scratched more than a handful of the last few games (flu) (back) and in the meantime, our pitching staff has had a difficult time staying in the majors, with Rick Porcello and Armando Galaragga each taking their turns in the minors. </p>

<p>It’s Miggy and the minors! (Note: I didn’t come up with that on my own – some Facebook friend or another said the team looked like Miggy and the Minors, and since then, I haven’t been able to get the notion of Miguel Cabrera as the “Charles in Charge” lead of a team of baby-faced baseball players – surely a Friday night sitcom. )</p>
<p>The infield especially – in the past few days before the Peralta trade, the infield was actually Miguel + Ramon (who, let’s be honest, only this year played his way into the position, so he may as well be a rookie). Don Kelly – the 30 year old rookie – was even taking a few turns at third.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s slim pickings, but the fact that our boys in blue are even scoring or not looking like those teams we annihilated earlier in the season is in itself remarkable, and a fabulous endorsement of the minor league system we’ve got working. And, as you’ll no doubt learn over the coming months, gentle reader, I am especially grateful for the opportunity to see names in the lineup that riff easily into nicknames – such as Will “Busta” Rhymes, holding it down at second and holy hell, is the kid fast, by the by.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the admirable performance of the “and the Minors” that’s keeping this team together. Let’s turn to Yeats. <a target="new" href="http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html">The opening stanza of “The Second Coming:”</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br />
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br />
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br />
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</p></blockquote>
<p>Disclosure: my relationship with baseball borders on the ecstatic/religious, so you’ll immediately note why I am thinking of Yeats when I say this: that the truly noteworthy aspect of this season is that, for the Tigers, the center IS holding, and the center has a name and wields a terrible bat: Miguel Cabrera. </p>

He still, nearly singlehandedly on some nights, has kept the Tigers’ season on life support. The savior comparison is obvious and insulting, so I’ll let you fill in the blanks on that one.</p>
<p>But it’s not just a poetry-meets-humor-meets-baseball-and-Jesus post, folks. It’s the airtight case for Cabrera as MVP, regardless of whether he rocks the Triple Crown this year or not. The man has saved more games than Valverde can legitimately lay claim to, and he doesn’t have an off night. </p>
<p>First game back after his new baby was born? Three homers. In. One. Game. (The Tigers did lose the game – a rare night when the boys wasted Miggy’s rare talent.)</p>
<p>Sure, Robinson Cano is having a great year, too, but people, I think I could have a great year too if my teammates were the Yankees. </p>
<p>Maybe Yeats makes the best case for Cabrera, MVP:</p>
<blockquote><p>Surely some revelation is at hand;<br />
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br />
The Second Coming! …<br />
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br />
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br />
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br />
Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br />
The darkness drops again but now I know<br />
That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br />
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br />
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br />
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p></blockquote>
