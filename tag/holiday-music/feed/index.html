Is it the hair? Is it the fact that he is nuts? Is it the fact that he shot that lady in his driveway? Or it is his music, the Wall of Sound, the Ronettes, <em>Let It Be</em>, or his work with John Lennon &amp; George Harrison in the early 70s? I think of all these things, from the crazy to the cool, but I also think of Spector’s really great Christmas LP from 1963, <em>A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector</em>. Did I mention it was released in 1963? Care to guess the date? November 22, 1963, the day John Kennedy was shot in Dallas. Needless to say that the LP initially faded from view due to this unfortunate event. (Times change as Jay Z’s first volume of <em>The Blueprint</em> was released on September 11, 2001. That record went Platinum) and needless to say everything changed after the President was shot. The following year the Beatles would hit the American airwaves and shores and music, youth music, would rise anew.</p>
<p>When I first got heavy into Frank Sinatra what struck me was the timing. Watching <em>Oceans 11</em>, listening to a record with Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, anything having to do with this culture was really rendered stale and lame by the arrival of British Pop music in the 60s. When you compare times, sure there will be things that seem different, making what was fresh seem stale. I’m sort of shocked then that the Spector Christmas Record didn’t make a splash in spite of those horrible circumstances. When I put it up into the context of 1963 you would think it arrived in a space ship.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed when I heard the LP was its sense of joy. Pure, raw joy. These songs are happy, no, these songs are a celebration of the season. It sounds so cliché, it feels cliché to write it and look at it, but listening to the record it conjures up happy smiles and happy memories. The template for the Wall of Sound was in place prior to this LP being released; &#8220;Be My Baby&#8221; was also released in 1963. But this LP is just an amazing bit of sound.</p>
<p>Most of my favorite Christmas music is the kind that invokes a quiet, sedate mood: nighttime, watching the fire crackling in the fireplace, or reflecting on the year that has invariably whipped by in the crack of a knuckle. These records are ones I would consider calm, and that&#8217;s  part of their appeal. The Spector Christmas ain’t sedate, it ain’t calm. No, this is a record mad for being outside, in the blinding white snow with a deep blue sky overheard. It is joyful, cheerful, and rollicking. The only &#8220;slow&#8221; song on the LP is the last track, which is really just a spoken bit from Spector himself.</p>
<p>There are some other up-tempo Christmas songs from this period, but none had the same sass or energy as these songs. For the year 1963, the best selling Christmas LP was one by Andy Williams. The Ronettes he ain’t. Ella Fitzgerald’s 1960 Christmas LP had a bit more bite to the songs and arrangements, but the energy feels much more traditional, much more in line with the time. Listen to Ella’s LP, <em>Ella Wishes You A Swinging Christmas</em> and then the Spector LP. You can practically feel the joy and vibrations coming from the plastic when you open the case, so clearly cracking is the LP.</p>
<p>It is that youthful edge, that energy and joy and happiness that makes the Phil Spector Christmas LP with its bevy of different artists an all-time classic that you can listen to during the season and not get bored with or tired of. It is brief but packs ten times the amount of joy that one could seriously expect on a tiny tinny piece of plastic. </p>

Do you remember when it started? I was walking through Meijer with my kids the other day, just as the store’s Christmas displays were going up. I said aloud, to nobody in particular, “When I was younger Christmas was in December.” An older couple was walking in front of us and they heard me, I could tell in their body language and the slight smile as the husband looked at his wife. It was the last week of October. </p>
<p>When I think about Christmas, I think about silence. When I was younger there was stillness to the season. You felt removed from reality, isolated. No broadband, no wireless devices. Presents. Snow, if you were lucky. Darkness, fire in the fireplace accompanied by silence. Stillness. I wonder if this is something that is becoming an antique. I mean, I’ve seen 13-year-old kids with cell phones. Was the emptiness of the season an outdated thing? Nowadays I feel like we cannot escape, cannot have that anymore, that stillness. Maybe it is just a personal thing, as we grow up do we lose that peacefulness, that emptiness? I experienced it a bit a few years ago, driving around the MSU campus at dusk. It was empty and gorgeous in the pink sunset. Am I a relic? Do I expect there to be this sense that we all share that might be unfounded? I never remember seeing Christmas stuff in October. I remember waiting for the Sears catalog, but never in October. Did working in a mall do this to me? To the way I enjoy the holidays? 8 hours of music a day, lightning fast days with increasingly rude and frazzled customers.  A day off work but before you know it you&#8217;re right back into the thick of things the very next day. I wonder if this is a side effect of aging, losing those moments and memories as life piles up around your feet.</p>

I am one who believes that music is molecular, that something changes in you when you hear music. Memories are instantly associated and strengthen those connections. For me there are a few memories of Christmas music growing up. The biggest is obvious and I will discuss it in a few weeks. For now I’ll talk about the first Christmas LP I can remember, John Denver &amp; the Muppets.  I remember my parents having the John Fahey Christmas LP, the cover is a dead give away, and who amongst us didn’t either have a copy or know someone with a copy of Mitch Miller’s Christmas Sing-A-Long LP. </p>
<p>I spent eleven Christmas seasons in retail: six working in a proper record store, five working in a bookstore with a music department. At the record store we played the music of the season sparingly, tastefully. At the bookstore we played the music offensively, all day in many cases. I feel I have seen both sides of the holiday music coin. I prefer the first way, as a feature to enhance business and set a mood rather than a tool to sell things. Call me old fashioned. I never gave the music thought at the record store but found it oppressive at the bookstore, which led me to owning Holiday CDs but never choosing to listen to these records. Five Christmases out of retail have sort of cured those ill feelings.</p>
<p>I spent four Christmases as a DJ on a local radio station. There was a rule at WNMC: No Christmas music until the week of Christmas. Novel, when you think about it. Even with the availability of the music in the station the DJs, all volunteers, chose their holiday selections judiciously, respectfully. It was there, in the basement of West Hall, that I sort of re-learned to love Christmas music. I was able to find interesting recordings, play them in a way that fit the overall theme and feel of my show. Last year, far removed from both retail and radio, I actually played Christmas music recreationally. I would load up the CD player and let it play.</p>
<p>I have kids of my own now, two of them in fact. I want them to enjoy the season as a whole, and I want them to have memories of the sights, sounds and smells of the season. We have established a few traditions revolving around the holidays. An educational toy store in Suttons Bay hosts real reindeer and taking the kids to see the animals is one of the highlights of the season for me. Last year when I put on the Christmas music it was a nice, calm Sunday. I don’t remember if there was snow on the ground or in the sky. I do remember how nice it felt, sitting there and listening. I hope to give those feelings to my kids so that when they are in my shoes, maybe they will feel the same way.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I’ll be taking a look at different Christmas music. I do not expect this to be a complete look, we only have a few weeks.  Frankly we will be looking at a few of my own personal favorites. Some you may know, some you may not. I might even have a surprise to throw into a column or two. But please feel free over these next few weeks to talk about some of your personal favorite memories of Christmas music or any other Holiday music that you were raised on.</p>
