										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Detroit Tigers third baseman, catcher, centerfielder, oh-hell-put-him-anywhere-and-he&#8217;ll-play guy Brandon Inge was called up from the Tigers&#8217; Triple-A affiliate in Toledo to join the starting lineup against left-handed pitchers. A ringing endorsement, I know. Inge was assigned to Toledo earlier this season when his hitting, never stellar, totally bottomed out &#8212; .177 in 239 appearances at the plate.</p>
<p>In Inge&#8217;s first at-bat after rejoining the Tigers, <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011108210617" target="_blank">he hit a home run</a>.</p>
<p>Inge is the kind of player fans either love or hate, often, I think for the same reasons. He&#8217;s only ever played for the Tigers, which is either a sign of loyalty or that Inge isn&#8217;t good enough to play anywhere else. He was a member of the 2003 team that lost more games than any other in the history of the American League, which gives his presence on a team making a playoff run this year a feeling of redemption, or every time he walks to the dugout after striking out serves as a reminder of that team&#8217;s failures. At his best at the plate, he&#8217;s a mediocre hitter, with little power and control who strikes out too much. He participated in the 2009 Home Run Derby and didn&#8217;t hit a single home run. At his best in the field, he&#8217;s a miracle. It&#8217;s a crime that he&#8217;s never won a Golden Glove.</p>
<p>For me, Inge is the last remaining piece of an old puzzle, a link both to the worst Tigers team I ever watched and to the team I&#8217;ve loved more than any other. He played with Bobby Higginson and Dimitri Young. Pudge Rodriguez, who was the first well-paid piece of the Tigers post-2003 rebuilding puzzle, took Inge&#8217;s spot as catcher. He played with Justin Verlander, Magglio Ordóñez, Sean Casey, Curtis Granderson, Kenny Rogers, and Joel Zumaya in 2006. Casey and Rogers were gone the next year. Zumaya has been the walking wounded most of the time since then. Granderson was traded to New York in 2009. Inge is still around.</p>
<p>It may not be for that much longer, and when Inge is done with the Tigers, he&#8217;ll be done for good. Nobody wanted to trade for Inge when Miguel Cabrera took over his spot at third base in 2008. (Inge didn&#8217;t even get his spot back when Cabrera moved to first base, and Carlos Guillén, who was useless at first base, got the chance to be useless at third.) No one picked up Inge on waivers when he was assigned to Toledo. It&#8217;s entirely possible that Inge is too expensive: not enough offense, and defense that will get worse and not better with each passing year.</p>
<p>Even I&#8217;m not romantic enough to say that he deserves a spot just because he seems to be a really great guy, a true professional who has taken everything the team has thrown at him, played everywhere &#8212; <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011108140561" target="_blank">and I mean everywhere</a> &#8212; they&#8217;ve asked him to play. Granderson was a great guy too, and I think trading him was the right move. The Tigers know what they&#8217;re doing, and when Inge really doesn&#8217;t have anything left to offer, they&#8217;ll pay out his contract and let him go. I&#8217;ll be sad, even if it&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to enjoy it while he&#8217;s here, as long as it lasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps I am of the softball-playing age where I should begin to think of being put out to pasture&mdash;pasture, in this case, being the desolate expanse of the outfield known as right field.</p>
<p>I have been a centerfielder for much of the time since returning to Lansing&#8217;s beer league co-ed rec division post-the birth of my daughter. For the most part, I have enjoyed it&mdash;even reveled in it.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1293" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1293" data-attachment-id="1293" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/10/19/the-hot-corner/bo-jackson/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg" data-orig-size="496,294" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bo-jackson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=496" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300&#038;h=177" alt="Bo Jackson" title="bo-jackson" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-1293" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300&amp;h=177 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=150&amp;h=89 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg 496w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1293" class="wp-caption-text">Bo knows avascular necrosis.</p></div> Except this year. I&#8217;m bored. Tracking fly balls is less thrilling, and more, well, blah. My focus isn&#8217;t there, and my joints aren&#8217;t a fan of sprinting across uneven, mole-hole filled terrain. Especially this fall, as I&#8217;ve been suffering from what seems to be a hip pointer. (Which is, as I described it to the man in the convenience store, the injury that took Bo Jackson from two-sport pro athlete to retired trivia subject pretty quickly.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for a new challenge. Or looking to recapture the potential I had in my youngest days, when my first fast-pitch coaches would place me at third (which then seemed insulting, as we all wanted to play first) because I had the arm, even then, to make the throw. (Even then, I was tossing the ball with a modified sidearm motion.)</p>
<p>I did play most of one co-ed season&mdash;my first back in action&mdash;at third. That wasn&#8217;t a particularly shining effort, but now I&#8217;m ready to give it the old Little League try all over again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to start training. (Heck, it&#8217;ll also lead to some great blog fodder, right?) Beginning as soon as I find a willing trainer (the Mickey to my Rocky), I am spending the off-season fielding grounders, learning to dive (eek!) and, really, hoping to make myself the most Brandon Inge-like 3B in a skirt in Lansing.</p>
<p>Aside from ordering the Tom Emanski videos, what should I do? Who should be my Mickey? How do I become a great co-ed 3B? What else do I need to do?</p>
<p>Answers, please. This is going to be painful either way&mdash;but perhaps I can augment that with just a little fun.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Watching the wonderful new installment of Ken Burn’s <em>Baseball</em> (the original, I sheepishly admit, I have yet to watch), <em>The Tenth Inning</em>, a player mentioned something similar: the chemistry comes when you’ve been winning together, when you are all bought into the plan, when the games get tough and you all&#8212; each of you&#8212;grind out each at-bat, each pitch, to get the right ball to hit and the hit that drives in the run that wins the game.

That kind of focus and workmanship has been missing from the Tigers since, well, 2006. And it’s the kind of thing you don’t get by building, or retaining, guys for amorphous reasons, like “He’s a veteran,” “He’s a leader,” or “The sound of the ball off his bat is different, like all the greatest hitters the game has ever known.”

So the Tigers have already announced who is not coming back&#8212;at least, not at this pay scale.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Leyland is famous (in my mind) not just for his mustache, but for busting up the most clichéd sporting myths with curt quotes. (Never mind that he’s responsible for some completely original epic inventions, like the time he said in a mid-inning interview that that sound of the ball coming off a great hitter’s bat just plain sounded different. Amazingly, he was talking about Craig Monroe, who, say what you will about where he is now [out of baseball], could evidently ring the distinct sounding sweet spot with the greatest hitters Jim had ever heard.)</p>
<p>Jim says team chemistry is overrated; give him a group of guys who can win together.</p>

So long, pal. so long.</p></div>Neither Magglio Ordoñez’s winning smile, spectacular hair or even the way he came back to trigger his option in 2009 with a stellar end of season is worth the price of this year’s option&mdash;$15 million. Of course we’ll all always remember fondly his walk-off homerun, which sent the hooded Placido Polanco galloping and celebrating around third, and sent the Tigers to the 2006 World Series. My money is on Brennan Boesch ironing out his late-season batting issues and winning the job in right field. If Magglio does re-sign, I bet he’ll be primarily a DH supporting the everyday RF.</p>
<p>Jeremy Bonderman hasn’t pitched a complete season that I can recall, either suffering a “dead arm” or a legit blood clot or some variation thereof. He’s got good stuff, but, as doomed former skipper Alan Trammel would say, it’s the one bad inning that gets him. Every start. Too bad for him the Tigers can get a starter who’ll be hurt often and give up tons-o-runs one inning each start for much, much less than Bondo’s recent rate. Some National League team will get him at a bargain rate, and he’ll probably become a 5th (maybe 4th) starter of note. He’s welcome to Spring Training if he doesn’t catch on anywhere else, and if that happens, I think the bullpen is an option.</p>
<p>And goodbye Johnny Damon, whose single most important contribution to the team in this, his single year as a Tiger, was not his spirited defense of the city of Detroit as he spurned the waiver wire advances of the Boston Red Sox, but the time he convinced the bullpen, a few starters and some other position players to trim their locks into Mohawks. Wouldn’t it be great if he ended up back with the Royals? Or the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he could pick on National League pitching and hang out with new manager Kirk Gibson?</p>

I like long at-bats and turning two. Call me. Or my agent.</p></div>Probably Carlos Guillen should pack his bags too. Despite his willingness to play anywhere (platooning in the outfield, short stop, second, first when Cabrera was originally signed and then third when Cabs moved to first and no one wanted to apologize to Brandon Inge and put him back at the hot corner) microfracture surgery&mdash;which he had after the hard “break up the double play” slide that sent him to the DL&mdash;is no joke. It’s not promising to have anything in common with Greg Oden (well, ok, maybe ONE thing), and his creaky knees are probably never going to improve. Besides, I’d rather see Will “Busta” Rhymes and Scott “Don’t Call Me Grady” Sizemore have a metaphorical knife-fight for the right to play second. Frankly, I’d rather see Cabrera and Inge as the team elders, and the payroll down substantially to make room for a few new guys.</p>
<p>It looks like we can say welcome back to Jhonny Peralta and Brandon Inge (barring a contract impasse). Dave Dombrowski says the Tigs won’t chase a Cliff Lee-caliber player, but they’re looking for rotation slots 3/4/5 to be filled. One with Phil Coke. (And his spectacular sideburns.)</p>
<p>Perhaps in the coming months we’ll have signed Carl “The Perfect Storm” Crawford (ohpleaseohpleaseohplease), gotten word that Joel Zumaya will never be hurt again (I’m saying rosaries for that one) and maybe, just maybe, I’ll finally get a call back about being the Tigers bench coach. </p>
<p>One just can’t say for certain. But it will be something to look forward to, to tide us through the winter.</p>
<p>Quick hit playoff picks:</p>

Facial hair.</p></div>The Twins will continue to be a team good enough to win the AL Central handily, not good enough to make it out of the first round. Yankees in six, with A-Rod doing something douche-tastic in the fourth game.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Giants will fall prey to The Curse Of Barry Bonds’ Jerkism (and paying way too much money for Barry Zito) and will be dispatched by the Braves. Braves in 5.</p>
<p>In a battle of sweet red uniforms (my personal favorite) the Reds and the Phillies will take it to seven games. Much as it pains me to say this (because the Phillies are my National League team) the Reds will take game 7. Tear.</p>
<p>Everything is bigger in Texas, including the hype. A rookie closer and Josh Hamilton’s sore ribs won’t be much more than a speed bump for Carl Crawford, Evan Longoria and Matt Garza. These boys know how to win, and they grind it out. Rays in 5. Four if Longoria has a beard.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it’s the Robert Fick jersey popping up at a road game, or a talking head mentioning the time Shane Halter played all nine positions in one game. Sometimes it’s my brother reminding me of the guy I dated that one summer who looked like Rich Becker, or how the name Chad Kreuter seemed to us as children both vaguely pornographic and slightly B-movie horror madman-esque.

However they’re called up, the specters of the players we grew up with (and had perhaps even entirely forgotten about until they were invoked, like disembodied voices at a séance) still linger near the dirt of the on-deck circle, exist, somehow, side by side with Miguel Cabrera even though maybe they’re now living in Florida or running a limo company or imprisoned in South America.

So when Binge (B + Inge = Binge, and describes, for this fan, his feast-or-famine approach to offense) poked one through the infield, turning his all-time hits ticker from 999 to 1000, it was only fitting that the leading edge of Bobby Higginson’s right forearm could be seen as his transparent self marked a cautious lead at third, his whole mouth stuffed with Big League chew and, of course, that fabulous goatee meticulously trimmed.

<p>And why wouldn’t Higgy be there? He’d played with Inge since the day Brandon made it up from the minors in 2001. They slogged through terrible seasons together, including the back-to-back 106- and 119-loss seasons. Higginson, who exited the game quietly in 2005, playing just 10 games and retiring in the offseason, was the last Tiger to get 1000 hits with the team.</p>
<p>Maybe it was something like unfinished business that kept the five-years-ago Higgy haunting the base paths.</p>
<p>When Higginson hung up his cleats, he did so without ever having a winning season under his belt, let alone having the success of the following season, when the Tigers tore through their opponents like some kind of nuclear disaster and entered the World Series as the best Cinderella story since the Boston Red Sox a few years prior. </p>
<p>I don’t know why, but he seems to be hanging around the edges of major league baseball lately. </p>
<p>Higgy is a Philadelphia native, and when the Phillies’ Roy Halladay tossed a perfect game this season, sharp fans were quick to note that Halladay took a no-hitter into the 9th on September 27, 1998, when the intended third out, Higginson, broke it up with a home run.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the way Higginson sort of disappeared slowly, like Marty McFly’s hand. Maybe it’s the silence, the lack of a formal announcement preserved in the annals of the internet, the full page ad in Detroit papers, thanking the fans, which we all remember him placing but seems to occupy a disintegrated sheaf of newsprint I cannot find record of now.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s got something to do with the fact that he hasn’t said a word about the Tigers since he retired, and he certainly hasn’t been brought back to the ballpark except by fans like me, who swear they see him swaggering out of the dugout on his way to left field.</p>
<p>It’s the same as the backyard game, playing short teams and calling for ghost runners. Even though you’d just been there, standing on third, and now you were knocking the bat against the soles of your shoes, you could still see your forty-seconds-ago self out of the corner of your eye, getting a lead. </p>
