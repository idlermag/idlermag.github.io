										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a sojourner in a strange land. I started alone, climbing a sand dune to catch my first glimpse of a mountain with a brilliant light glowing at its peak. As I walked toward the mountain, I encountered a glowing mark which wrapped itself around my neck and gave me the ability to float through the air. I found living scraps of fabric which carried me to a platform where I closed my eyes and saw a figure in white.</p>
<p>That figure would return as I moved forward to show me the story of the world and the people who came before me.</p>
<p>There is a balance every narrative game has to find between what the game gives you, and what it leaves for you to find. My first trip through the game was carried almost entirely by what was given. There was the experience of the world as I traveled through it, and there was the story of the world as revealed in the visions/cutscenes between levels. Every vision showed a little bit of where I had been, a little bit of where I was to go next, and a little bit of what had happened. It&#8217;s brilliantly difficult to be more specific than that, as the visions are images entirely free of text.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on writing. The visions are iconographic &#8212; the graphemes it uses are representations of embodiment and embodied action, and like all representation, it operates by demanding interpretation. The revealed story &#8212; the story communicated through the visions &#8212; is perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous. Life, living cloth, both flora and fauna, emanate from the energy of the mountain. People begin to direct energy, first into greater cloths, and then into structures which use cloths as energy sources. The people attain great heights, and then the energy starts to flicker. There is a tearing of the cloth. New, terrible machines are built under storm and cloud. The world is covered in sand. A single traveler appears, and moves through the ruins of the world to the mountain.</p>
<p>All of this is recorded. All of this is shown. None of it is explained. None of it has meaning independent of the traveler and the player&#8217;s experience. The traveler reconstructs the story by moving to a place in the world where a new chapter can be told. While the story, like all stories, is dependent on an imagined past, the play itself re-creates the story from the very first play. Without the traveler, without the reader, without the player, the writing is just an encoded possibility, a hope for a story. Every book, every game, every story is a ghost, a trace, a breath waiting for a body to enliven.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a companion. I was initially indifferent to others. The game has a trophy given when the player encounters 10 other players within the game. I earned this trophy on my first playthrough, as I moved forward and left other players behind. The second time, however, I met a traveler in a white robe.</p>
<p>Unlike most games with online multiplayer functionality, <em>Journey</em> doesn&#8217;t give players a way to talk to each other using voice or text. Instead, you can press a button to make a noise (which varies in tune with the game&#8217;s soundtrack) and create a single luminescent glyph.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on language. Because you can &#8220;talk&#8221; quietly or loudly by tapping the button lightly or holding it down with greater pressure, the game&#8217;s single hailing action can be incredibly expressive. I soon realized that the other traveler was calling my attention to places in the world I should explore. I found new ruins, hidden flowers, and secret glyphs which added to the story told in the visions. We had a way to acknowledge each other, to keep track of each other, and, most interesting of all, to chatter. Sometimes our speech had a clear purpose &#8212; &#8220;Come over here!&#8221; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; &#8220;Can you see me?&#8221; &#8212; but sometimes it was more a way to share excitement, or nervousness, or wonder. That is, it was a conversation in which clear communication was taking place, but in which that communication was entirely indifferent to individual words. It was a striking reminder of how much of a conversation is carried by tone and context rather than grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>As we moved through the world, the traveler taught me, and I was able to say thank you. In the moments of greatest beauty, we sang to each other. We were not only acknowledging each other, but acknowledging the world, and participating in it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I returned to <em>Journey</em> after my two complete playthroughs for a number of smaller, partial attempts. After the game is completed, the end of the first, tutorial level becomes a gateway where the player can jump to any of the later levels, rather than having to play the whole game in order. I collected the glowing symbols I had missed. I found the final hidden glyphs. I earned a white robe of my own. I tried and failed to take on the role of teacher.</p>
<p>So the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I put the robe away. I gave up the external signs of experience, and simply entered the world again.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on humility. While the story is dependent upon the player as a reader, an actor, a participant, the world itself endures unchanged. In most games, replay value is measured by variability of outcome &#8212; different choices resulting in a different story, different actions leading to a higher score. <em>Journey</em> has no score, and the world, the symbols, the glyphs, the visions, and the outcome are the same every time. You may approach the mountain alone or with a companion, clothed in brown or white, with a long flowing scarf or with almost no scarf at all. The mountain always strips all of these things away. The end is always the same.</p>
<p>And yet <em>Journey</em> is the only video game I can think of which I&#8217;ve played from beginning to end three times.</p>
<p>And the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I met a traveler. Somehow, I was better as a guide in the brown robe instead of the white, and I showed my companion the better paths. As we approached the mountain, in the final wind and snow, we were separated, and I did something I had never done before. I waited. When my companion was blown from the path, I sat in one place so that she could climb back and we could finish the journey together. Even then, somehow, she got ahead of me without my having seen her, and I found myself rising to catch up. I&#8217;m still not sure if I was mistaken somehow about her having lost the path, or if I was inattentive, or if she found a new way. None of these things seems likely, but I know for certain that we were separated and found each other further ahead. My patience, apparently, was nothing compared to my companion&#8217;s, as she waited for me to finish waiting for her. We entered the mountain together, to begin again, alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I saw the world.</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I learned the language.</p>
<p>The third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was part of the world.</p>
<p>I may yet return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 50 very pleasant hours playing BioWare&#8217;s <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, I&#8217;m at something of a loss to make sense of what just happened. Perhaps it&#8217;s useful to begin with my description of those 50 hours as &#8220;pleasant,&#8221; which isn&#8217;t quite correct. There was a tremendous &#8212; and very interesting &#8212; tension at work during my gameplay. I was often in something of a hurry, as the are very specific constraints on my play time, and portions of the <em>Mass Effect 2</em> experience are supremely slow. I found myself cringing every time I needed to move beyond my immediate surroundings by taking a shuttle to a new landing site or docking at a city. Even taking the elevator between levels on Commander Shepard&#8217;s ship the Normandy meant an interminable wait staring at a loading screen. The <em>Mass Effect</em> universe is a place constantly tottering on the brink of total collapse, with each of the various societies Shepard encounters pleading for intervention in the final minutes of their darkest hour, but there&#8217;s no particular urgency. If Shepard receives a report of a ship in danger of falling into a planet&#8217;s atmosphere, the player can rely on the event to not actually occur until Shepard has leisure enough to make the trip.</p>
<p>In fact, the unintended implication of <em>Mass Effect</em>&#8216;s episodic but non-sequential narrative architecture may be that the truly moral choice would be for Shepard to fly from system to system but never actually land. Each of the distress calls would continue to beckon, preserved in a stasis where some existential danger has been comprehended, but eternally delayed. I like to imagine entire generations living their whole lives on that ship, passing the story of the hero who will come to save them to their children and their children&#8217;s children. It&#8217;s an appealing counternarrative to the adolescent fantasy of an individual hero whose labors succeed where armies, scientists, and politicians have failed. It would also save the player from having to wait for all of those loading screens.</p>
<p>Even so, while it may not be quite right to speak of my time playing the game as pleasant, I have to acknowledge that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> was a rich experience. Peter Brooks<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> argues that a great deal of the pleasure of narrative comes not just from knowing the ending, but in the postponement of the ending, and in that light, <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a masterpiece. The plot of <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is actually pretty thin &#8212; Shepard dies (why not?), is brought back to figure out who is kidnapping entire human colonies, a crew is recruited, some navigational information is recovered, and everyone flies to the center of the galaxy to save the world and learn a little something about themselves.</p>
<p>But while the main story itself doesn&#8217;t give the player that much to do, there are a million ways to put off doing that handful of things. Every character Shepard recruits wants something, and expects Shepard to get, save, and/or destroy it for them. While I think BioWare would argue that these errands constitute a major part of the main storyline &#8212; and they did indeed compose a significant fraction of my play time &#8212; they&#8217;re also entirely optional. More importantly, in terms of the narrative architecture, making the character loyalty missions optional means that they have to be entirely independent of each other. Nothing that you do on any one loyalty mission can directly affect any other because the game can&#8217;t assume that you&#8217;ve completed (or will ever complete) any specific mission before completing another. Without that necessary sequential relation, there is no room for causes and effects. Each mission is its own context, meaning, and self-contained consequence, and Shepard remains a blank state onto which entire civilizations can project their hopes and fears, a knight-errant.</p>
<p>While BioWare is famous for their choice-centered <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/04/22/mass-effect/">good or evil/light side vs. dark side/paragon vs. renegade</a> gameplay, and for creating game franchises where the choices made in earlier games carry over into sequels, these choices can necessarily have only marginal impacts. If the player makes a choice that results in a character&#8217;s death in an earlier game, then this character will not show up in the sequel, but since each game must be created to encompass both the possibility that character X is alive and dead, then characters from earlier games <em>must</em> be limited to secondary (or cameo) roles in later games. Commercial constraints mean that BioWare cannot create a <em>Mass Effect 3</em> which cannot be beaten (or is ultimately any less rich of an experience) if any single character is killed in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. (Imagine, for example, a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> where it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether Boromir or Aragorn dies. Tolkien would not have been able to make Aragorn so central to the plot of the second book, and so absolutely critical to the resolution of the war. Boromir&#8217;s death would be robbed of its classically tragic nobility.)</p>
<p>The result is that each game demands that you assemble a new cast of characters, and largely abandon your previous crew. Relationships still exist, sort of, but of necessity cannot be central to the action or narrative development of the new game. There are major choices in <em>Mass Effect 2</em> that promise to impact <em>Mass Effect 3</em> &#8212; you can strengthen or decimate the Geth, you can deliver the Collector base to Cerberus or destroy it &#8212; but these decisions cannot do much more than change a handful of cutscenes. (The outcome of the war does not really depend on whether you win the loyalty of Rohan or tell them off.)</p>
<p>None of which is to say that you shouldn&#8217;t play <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. It&#8217;s an extraordinary game in terms of visuals, setting, and characterization, but it&#8217;s a triumph of storytelling and not of story, of world building and not of narrative. Raph Koster has argued that <a href="http://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/20/narrative-is-not-a-game-mechanic/" target="_blank">&#8220;Narrative is not a game mechanic&#8221;</a> &#8212; that is that narrative in video games is not a central operation of the game itself but a way for the game to provide feedback to a player who is navigating the game&#8217;s essentially non-narrative problem set (mash button, kill monster, steer car, etc.). I&#8217;m not totally convinced by Koster&#8217;s argument, but <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a pretty strong example of what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a picaresque (and a good one) and not a novel. It&#8217;s a convincing illusion of a world in which the player has agency and choices have persistent effects, even though the overarching story does its best to undo those effects. None of these observations are meant to be criticisms of the quality of the game. In fact, most of them could be addressed if BioWare were designing individual, standalone games rather than franchises. It&#8217;s not the mechanic/narrative interface that defeats the possibility of player choices from having a significant and lasting impact on the narrative world, it&#8217;s the lack of a clear and specific endpoint.</p>
<p>The world doesn&#8217;t end, and because the world continues, the game has to account for all the choices the player <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make.</p>
<p>So do enjoy <em>Mass Effect 2</em> &#8212; I did &#8212; but don&#8217;t feel bad if you take your time about it. The world will wait for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games are a troublesome medium. Rogert Ebert, famously, <a target="new" href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html">isn&#8217;t convinced that they&#8217;re art</a>. Even those of us who love video games are often apologetic. Yes, many video games are just terrible. Yes, it&#8217;s true that no video game can stand up to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or Beethoven&#8217;s Fifth Symphony, or <em>Ulysses</em>. (Or maybe <em>War &amp; Peace</em>, if you&#8217;re the sort of person who doesn&#8217;t like <em>Ulysses</em>. I happen to like <em>Ulysses</em>.)</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m primarily interested in video games as a medium for narrative and story, not despite but because I think it&#8217;s an open question whether video games are particularly well-suited to narrative.</p>
<p>In fact, depending on what and how you read, the idea of video games as a venue for narrative is in trouble right now. This week, IGN ran a piece on <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/118/1185726p1.html" target="_blank">the end of the $60 single-disc big-budget video game</a> in favor of less-expensive segmented downloads. (This business model is actually not all that far from a lot of &#8220;single-disc&#8221; games, which offer players the opportunity to purchase and download additional content &#8212; &#8220;DLC&#8221; &#8212; after the initial purchase of the physical disc. It just eliminates the requirement that the player buy the disc first.) <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6828237/beyond-angry-birds" target="_blank">Tom Bissell&#8217;s piece in Grantland</a> makes explicit the implied stakes of the low-cost, low-budget gaming world to come:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few months ago, a producer at a major video-game company startled me by admitting that the economic viability of the triple-A video-game production cycle — the expensive development process, in other words, by which games like Halo, Grand Theft Auto, Uncharted, and BioShock are unleashed upon the world — is in all likelihood doomed. Shortly after that, a developer told me he has a hard time imagining how single-player narrative video games are going to survive in the long run; such games, he believes, will eventually be seen as a historical anomaly. Neither man was particularly thrilled to imagine a future largely absent of the kinds of games he makes and most cares about, but current trends could not be ignored.</p>
<p>I told the developer that he sounded a bit like my fiction-writer friends going on about the inevitable death of the novel. &#8220;It takes one person to write a novel,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;To make the kinds of games we&#8217;re talking about, you need several dozen people — probably more like a hundred — with training across several fields. If the money&#8217;s not there, which is increasingly the case, the games can&#8217;t be made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that Bissell&#8217;s skepticism of the developer&#8217;s assertion is well-founded. The sky may well be falling, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that everything is coming to an end. Much like the death of the studio system that controlled prewar American filmmaking, the end of a particular business model will not mean the end of a medium.</p>
<p>While Bissell&#8217;s piece focuses on iPad games, including a number that tell stories surprisingly well, I&#8217;d like to try to shift the terms of the conversation a bit. (An ambitious goal, I know, but I&#8217;m going to take for granted that <em>Idler</em> readers will know from Andrew Simone&#8217;s writing that <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/02/essential-indie-games/" target="_blank">indie/web browser games can tell outstanding and challenging stories with incredibly limited resources</a>.)</p>
<p>First, there is a central mistake in considering whether video games as a medium are well-suited for narrative. The implied analogy is between video games and a genre like the novel or the fiction film, where narrative tools are built into the conceptual framework of the work itself. Video games, however, are a <em>medium</em> and not a <em>genre</em>. The more appropriate analogy would be between the video game and the book. Video games, like books, can be a productive venue for narrative, but like books, video games can be successful entirely independent of whether narrative exists within the individual work, and the success, failure, or indifference of the individual work is immaterial to the larger question as to whether narrative can work within a video game. A book of poetry may entirely ignore narrative, but it would be foolish to conclude from the fact that many great books exist which contain no narrative all that books are ill-suited to telling stories.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-media comparisons can be occasionally illuminating, but to judge video games by the narrative standards and conventions of the novel, opera, drama, or the fiction film is ultimately a mistake. Will video games ever produce a <em>Ulysses</em>? Clearly not. <em>Ulysses</em> already exists. Video games would (and do) do better to measure by and build on its own benchmarks.</p>
<p>And video games <em>do</em> tell some compelling stories, using their own tools, and with their own unique strengths and flaws. Rather than figuring out whether <em>Heavy Rain</em> is as good as your favorite novelist, however, let&#8217;s talk about what makes its story work, and try to imagine what stories video games could (and should) be telling, especially if the big-budget, risk-averse, &#8220;let&#8217;s-make-another-sequel&#8221; business model comes crashing down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my challenge to video game critics, players, and creators. I&#8217;ll do what I can to live up to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve never heard of the <a href="http://www.themoth.org/storyslams">Moth Story Slam</a> here’s what it is:</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Every month <a href="http://www.cliffbells.com/">Cliff Bell’s</a> in downtown Detroit hosts this fantastic little competition MC’d by the hilarious Alex Trajano of <a href="http://www.wdetfm.org/">WDET</a>.  The idea is people from the audience throw their name in a hat and ten people are chosen to tell a story.  The story must relate to the theme of that night, have a beginning, middle and end, and be told in five minutes.  Teams of judges are chosen from the audience and the storyteller awarded the most points wins.  This goes on monthly for a year and Slam winners then compete in the GrandSlam.</p>
<p>A wonderful, generous friend of mine donated to WDET, which sponsors the Slam, and was given VIP seats for a year. VIP seats are important when Cliff Bell’s gets filled to fire-safety-regulated capacity every Slam night.  My friend invited me to go to this month’s March Slam and I took her up on it with enthusiasm. If you don’t hold VIP seats you best get down to CB’s early if you don’t want to stand the whole night.  The Slam starts at seven-thirty, we were there by five, and it was already crowded to standing room only.</p>
<p>The theme for March was animals.  I love animals.  I like talking about animals.  I have a few stories about them.  My friend finds these stories amusing and encouraged me to put my name in the hat.  So I did.</p>
<p>I used to do theater in high school.  I very much enjoy karaoke.  I’m not scared of crowds.  There’s always a bit of an adrenaline rush, but other than that I can get up, do my thing and feel pretty okay with it, performance quality aside.</p>
<p>I didn’t think it would happen, but crazily, my name got picked out of the hat.  My friend was excited for me, and I was suddenly struck with a mild panic.</p>
<p>You see, the stories aren’t supposed to be rehearsed, but they announce the theme a month in advance.  People have plenty of time to come up with a story and/or decide if they want to spend an evening listening to stories on that theme.  I had a funny story in my mind organized into a beginning, middle and end that I practiced a couple times just to figure out the timing.  They blow a whistle every minute you go over the allotted time and I wanted to be sure I could practice proper etiquette.</p>
<p>So my name got picked.  I got up.  I was blinded by spotlights and immediately went into my story.  It was about monkeys being too violent and sexy for children at the zoo.  The thing was, in my mild panic I inadvertently abandoned my plan.  My mouth went on automatic and it told the animal stories I meant to tell, but without a beginning, middle and end.  I can’t remember hearing laughter or not.</p>
<p>Another important thing about the Story Slam: It’s for stories, not stand-up.  They don’t want you going up there and telling a bunch of jokes.  There are comedy clubs for that. However, it would seem my default setting for public storytelling is to tell it a bit like stand-up routine, only not quite as funny as real comic.</p>
<p>When I was done I went back to my seat, not entirely satisfied with the way I told my story, but happy I had the experience.</p>
<p>Then it was time for the judges to sound off.  I had, somehow, completely forgotten about the scoring part of the slam.  I was the third person to go up and received the lowest score up to that point.  I was there to have fun and hear hysterical stories, but I will admit there was a part of me that hoped someone else would get a lower score by the end of the Slam.  No such luck.  I stayed at the bottom the rest of the night.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people in that place, and I like to think there were at least a few people who found my tales of the murderous mandrill, sexy bonobos and a masturbating chimpanzee mildly entertaining.  In fact, a lady came up to me during intermission to tell me she thought I was robbed, that she really liked my story.  The thing was, thinking back over how I ended up telling it, I wasn’t that happy with it.  I had a better way of telling that story.  I suddenly thought of other stories I could have told better.  My tale didn’t have a beginning, middle and end, and it had the air of stand-up about it, which is probably why it scored so low.  Another possible disadvantage is that, being one of the first few people up there, the judges weren’t as drunk as they could/might have been/probably were by the second half, but thems the breaks.</p>
<p>It was still an amazingly fun time.  The other nine stories were all entertaining and the experience was one I will always remember.  Still, I’d like to have just one more crack at it. </p>
