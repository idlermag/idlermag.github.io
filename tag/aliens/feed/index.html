										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>We can allow satellites, planets, suns, universe, nay whole systems of universe, to be governed by laws, but the smallest insect, we wish to be created at once by special act.</p>
<p>&#8212; Charles Darwin</p></blockquote>
<p>If I had a dime for every time I’ve watched <em>Aliens</em> (1986) I’d have, well, a lot of dimes. It remains a staple of my childhood, when I had an army of <em>G.I. Joe</em> action figures and <em>Star Wars</em> spaceships, which I used almost exclusively to play <em>Aliens</em>. Recently, I even sat through it on Syfy, commercial interruptions and curse word cover-ups be damned.</p>
<p>As I grew older I began to gravitate more towards the original film in the series, <em>Alien</em> (1979), which is a psycho-sexual horror film masquerading as science fiction. I responded more to the slow burn, the anguish of knowing that <em>it</em> was coming, but not when. <em>Alien</em> uses shadows similar to the way another great monster film (1975&#8217;s <em>Jaws</em>) uses water &#8212; to help disguise the fundamental flaws of the creature FX while simultaneously forcing the filmmaker to be more creative when deciding how and when to reveal the monster itself.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I saw the transport ship Nostromo touch down on a remote planet in response to an S.O.S. signal, only to find a giant humanoid alien with a hole in its chest. I remember wondering, “Who <em>is</em> that thing? Where did he come from? What’s <em>he</em> all about?” That was right before I was interrupted by the film&#8217;s actual, kick-ass story full of terror, fantastic sets, innovative creature design and rock-solid acting. So yeah, after the initial reveal, I didn’t give two shits about that giant humanoid alien. It appears as though I’m in the minority, though, as <em>Prometheus</em> (2012), <em>Alien</em>’s quasi-prequel, opened last weekend and purports to explain said alien’s origins as well as a whole slew of other things. (Like, the origins of man, for example. You know, nothing major.)</p>
<p>It shouldn’t surprise me that its connections to the <em>Alien</em> series are mostly superfluous. As previously stated, I couldn’t care less about the fan-named “space jockey” at the beginning of <em>Alien</em>. I had always assumed that it was just a remnant of whatever species had occupied that planet before being collectively chest-busted by our parasitic friends. It turns out that this “space jockey,” &#8212; now re-named “engineer” &#8212; may have been involved in the very creation of all that we know and all that we are. Oh, and they may have accidentally created the parasitic race of aliens I have grown up loving, as well. You wanna make an omelet? You know what that involves.</p>
<p>That isn’t the only connection between the films, though. There are smatterings of the original films’ production design everywhere and the company funding the expedition, Weyland-Yutani, is the same company Ripley later works for. . . twice. Here’s the thing: none of it really matters. Not in context of <em>Prometheus</em>, at least.</p>
<p>What we have in <em>Prometheus</em> is two films struggling against each other. One of those films &#8212; the one about a possible explanation for man’s existence via some sort of directed panspermia &#8212; is pretty fascinating and unique. The other is an alien monster film, which has already been executed with such expert precision as to have invented its own subgenre. While the first half of the film puts forth a series of interesting ideas, the later eschews them in favor of more traditional faire.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the biggest problem. While no one in their right mind would argue that any of the <em>Alien</em> films is a character study (<em>Alien3</em> probably comes closest and people HATE that one. I’m not one of those people, for the record), those scripts at least allowed us to spend a decent enough amount of time with everyone to feel <em>something</em> for them. Once <em>Prometheus</em> gets rolling it hardly takes a breath. Remember all of those scientists who had all of those big questions? They can’t talk about them right now because their faces are melting. Or an alien is slithering out of their mouth. Or they’re mutating. Or self-performing a c-section! Yeah, that happens.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to make it seem as though <em>Prometheus</em> is completely without merit, so I suppose I should start mentioning something resembling a good quality? Well, everyone’s mentioned it already, but I’ll jump onto the bandwagon: <em>Prometheus</em> is a beautiful film. The intro, which involves one of the “engineers” ingesting some black, gooey genetic material, only to completely break down and disperse DNA identical to our own into an unnamed planet&#8217;s water supply, is visually stunning. And Michael Fassbender’s performance as “David,” the ship&#8217;s android, is fantastic and deeply unsettling.</p>
<p>I think that a solid argument could be made that <em>Prometheus</em> would have been better off having nothing to do with <em>Alien</em> in the first place. It will be interesting to see what happens in the inevitable sequel. The last surviving character is traveling in space in search of the “engineer’s” origin. (The old “who made the watchmaker” argument.) What we’re left with is a largely barren planet infested with parasitic aliens. How, exactly, did <em>Prometheus</em> have any real effect on what’s to come?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Child with camera" src="https://i1.wp.com/us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/lovleah/lovleah0701/lovleah070100055/728767-a-child-using-a-digital-video-camera-to-record-a-home-movie.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="240" />I have always had a problem with timelines. The events of my life, particularly my early years, ebb and flow. There are places, people and moments that remain very vivid to me, but placing it in time is another matter. It is because of this that I cannot pinpoint how old I was when I received the G.I Joe mobile command center. It was a rolling monstrosity that opened in the same tiered manner as a tool box to reveal a tri-level base of operations, complete with individual stations and rooms. It was the real deal, but I never actually played G.I. Joe with it. Not even once. I had darker plans for them.</p>
<div style="width: 256px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="    " title="G.I. Joe mobile command center" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.hisstank.com/forum/members/money-b-albums-targets-picture6208-mcc.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="184" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It could keep out COBRA commandos, but no one ever plans for parasitic aliens</p></div>
<p>Instead of staving off the tyranny of COBRA Commander and his army of aim-impaired flunkies, these Joes had to deal with the parasitic aliens that had infested their state-of-the-art plastic fortress, which now resided on some remote planet on the far side of the galaxy. They didn’t see it coming. They were torn limb from limb, exposing the little metal latches used to fasten the tiny, black rubber band that held their torso together. It was gruesome business, but when playing Aliens, I had to strive for authenticity.</p>
<p>Sometimes my Joes would find themselves deep in the jungle, relentlessly hunted by a ruthless Predator, other times by a cyborg Terminator in the heart of a post-apocalyptic city. Occasionally, they’d find themselves dragged to the bottom of a <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/08/the-horror-years/">Zombie Lake</a>, a fate I am not entirely proud of having reenacted.</p>
<div style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="Sarlacc pit" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.hahajk.com/uploads/2011/03/sarlacc.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="172" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The pits.</p></div>
<p>The boy across the street from me was an only child and, therefore, had the coolest swag. There wasn’t a Star Wars action figure he didn’t own and soon I found myself battling the Empire on his front lawn, and a hole created by a missing fence post stood in for the sarlacc pit. But when I received my own Millennium Falcon for Christmas it only ended up infested with those pesky parasitic aliens. I knew where my heart was.</p>
<p>As my film tastes matured, so did my reenactments. I had realized that my action figures couldn’t emote the way real people could. They couldn’t sling pistols like the Young Guns, or die in a blaze of Glory, crawling up the side of a fortress, American flag in hand.  I enlisted my friends, setting up scenarios that needed to be played out. I was already writing and directing.</p>
<p>All of my favorite childhood games became film recreations. When I was feeling ambitious, they were reimaginings. Either way, I remember strictly adhering to a strict three act structure during play time. There had to be a beginning, middle and end. I remember closing one eye, camera one, leaning in close and creating close-ups in my mind&#8217;s eye. In my head, I heard music swell. I was a strange lad, to be sure, but my film fandom was clear at an early age and it had already began to shape the way I told stories.</p>
