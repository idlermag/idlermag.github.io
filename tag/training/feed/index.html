										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trying to get into the habit of going to the gym by telling myself that from now on I would go at least 4 times a week and exercise for at least 30 minutes on something, anything, wasn’t working.  I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t constantly thinking that I really ought to make more of an effort to stay fit (in case of the Zombie Apocalypse), and yet my laziness always won out.  Then in September I had my cholesterol checked and got depressed over the numbers.  What was the use of trying to eat right or exercise?  I love eating and even if I ate exactly right all the time my body oversupplies itself with cholesterol all on its own.  All signs pointed to a lifetime of medications to reverse a condition already a problem at 28 years old.  Stupid genetics.</p>
<p>My genetics are against me in many ways.  They have given me a set of hips that should have absolutely no fear of childbirth and as such go against almost every fashion trend since the Marie-Antoinette-style dress that could part the red sea with its girth, wide shoulders that don’t fit well in sweaters, an underdeveloped sacrum that will probably betray me and snap in half when osteoporosis finally sets in, light-sensitive blue eyes that are so nearsighted I feel I ought to have a pet bat just so I won’t be the most blind thing in my house (also because a pet bat would just be effin’ RAD) and a stupid liver that makes tons of cholesterol just for the fun of it.  It took me a while to snap out of the self-loathing and finally decide (with lots of encouragement from Husband) what I was going to do about my cholesterol.</p>
<p>I started eating GoLean Crunch every morning for dietary starters and at the beginning of January I challenged myself to a 10K race.  I could already do a 5K during my lame “just exercise every day”  (aka “minimum amount of exercise to do once in a while when you’ve finally decided you hate yourself enough for today”) regimen and felt the need to (wo)man up a bit.  I didn’t sign up or register for anything official.  I decided to stick to a <a href="http://running.about.com/od/racetraining/a/10Kbeginner.htm">training schedule</a> and when the time came I would run (elliptical running—I get wicked shin splints when impact is involved) the 6.2 miles and be proud of myself.  I tried to get Sister in on this challenge, but she had her own thing she wanted to do.</p>
<p>Somehow, sticking to and completing the training was the easy part. I followed the schedule exactly except when life interfered and made me work out a day sooner/later.  The longer runs could be mildly torturous since my toes would go numb and afterward my feet felt like they were clenched into fists, but that was the only muscle soreness to speak of.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed the training.  I had finally found the trick for fixing myself long term:  Set a short-term goal.</p>
<p>Could I keep it up for 8 weeks until it was finally time to run a 10K?</p>
<p>Turns out I could.  This past St. Patrick’s Day I completed my 10K in 59:10.  The hour somehow felt short, easy.  My heart rate was under control, my pace was relatively consistent and my toes didn’t go completely numb.  I couldn’t do that 8 weeks ago.  I could be proud, right?</p>
<p>I wasn’t.  I’m not.</p>
<p>I thought I would have graduated to actual running at some point in the 8 weeks and wouldn’t feel like such a weakling trying to protect my dumb shins, but I couldn’t.</p>
<p>I thought I might have dropped at least one pant size by the end of 8 weeks, but I haven’t.</p>
<p>I thought I’d have someone to run with and feel a greater sense of accomplishment that two goals had been met, but I was alone.</p>
<p>I thought I wouldn’t have to talk myself into going to the gym anymore, but I do.</p>
<p>I thought the sky would be filled with rainbows and someone would throw me a parade.  A damned parade with elephants!</p>
<p>I finished my 10K, the longest distance and time I had ever completed in my entire lazy life, possibly one of my most accomplished moments, and all I got afterward was a barely enthused, “Have a nice day,” from the gym employee who saw me leaving.  Husband was waiting at home with a very large smile and very kind words, and I still didn’t feel very good about myself.  Why did completing this goal still somehow make me feel like a failure?</p>
<p>Because this didn’t work out the way I thought it would.  I thought I’d experience some sort of dramatic transformation; that I wouldn’t be able to live through a day without visiting the gym, that after 8 weeks of really, actually <em>trying</em> to make this change to my life I’d be rewarded by fitting into some of my old, smaller clothes and this would, in turn, motivate me for the next 8 weeks.  I thought it’d all be so fucking <em>easy</em> and I’d be <em>happy</em> by now.</p>
<p>But it’s still a struggle, an uphill climb where I can’t see the top, and I feel doomed.</p>
<p>The good (?) news is my cholesterol is down by about 20 points, a short lived victory when considering that my “lowered” cholesterol is still in what Dr. Kenny Loggins would describe as “the danger zone.”  Seeing as how the results of the exercise proved to be nothing like I thought, I’m going to go ahead and blame this small improvement on the cereal and not my increased physical stamina.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is easy.  I’ve been eating GoLean Crunch every day for almost three months now and I am officially sick of it to the point I don’t want to eat breakfast at all anymore.  Le Sigh.</p>
<p>I know I made an effort.  I know I made progress.  I know something has changed.  Yet, somehow, I still feel like I’m back where I started.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PEOPLE!</p>
<p>It is my birthday.</p>
<p>For the past few months, inspired largely by my the desire to not be huffing and puffing my way through my Friday evening softball sessions, I have acquired some really fabulous habits (an addiction to running on the elliptical at the Y, uber-healthy eating, tracking my activity and food intake) and dropped some not so fabulous habits (eating out for lunch, consuming too many lattes, indulging in junk food, boozing, talking myself out of working out).</p>
<p>The results are pretty spectacular. I’m in the shape of my life, and I am positively chomping at the bit to take the field the moment the snow melts off the infield.</p>
<p>In the polar opposite of the spirit of Lent (which, as a Catholic <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/01/miguel-miguel-ela/">like Miguel Cabrera</a> I am celebrating), here’s a list of things I don’t want to give up.</p>
<p>What I want for Opening Day:</p>
<table>

<td> 1. New cleats. Mine have seen the beginning and end of 8 or 9 seasons now, which is at least 7 more than I expected to get when I bought them at Dunham’s for like 20 bucks to replace the Nikes that had replaced the white Reeboks that got me through high school. Something like these beauties would do nicely.</td>

<td>2. A bat. My coach says my power will be unreal when I’m swinging a bat that’s got some pop to it. Now, people, I am 5 foot 2. According to various lame charts and whatnot on the interwebs, I am supposed to be slinging a hammer more appropriate for a toddler than Albert Pujols. But I didn’t earn the nickname Ryan Howard from my favorite teammate by slugging with a small, or even proportioned, bat. I’ll take this in a 34 inch, 28 ounce, please.</td>

This year, how about switching out my normal navy and black for something a little more … 70s?</td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took my first softball lesson less than a month after the fall softball season ended. Now we’re a week into February and pitchers and catchers report to Lakeland in a month. My season usually starts the first week of May, which is closer than it sounds. </p>
<p>Anticipating my own propensity to procrastinate, I’ve begun a list of what I want to accomplish in my training between now and my own Opening Day at Davis Park.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn to dive. This one cracks my husband (the natural athlete/soccer star/6-year-old state record holder) up. I was literally absent the day my high school team practiced diving, and now, as a 30-year-old, I need to catch up. I’m a bit apprehensive&mdash;when I reminded my coach, he said, “Oh, no, I have to put you through that?” Since my midsection and ribs have made it this far unscathed, I suppose it’s time for some gut checks&mdash;literally.</li>
<li>Buy new cleats. My current cleats have been stretched by years of playing outfield, where the grass is almost always wet. Over the past few months, I’ve done even more damage to them: the leather of the instep is shredding from dragging my right foot at the end of a throw, etc. And the actual cleats are worn down so far that I slipped a handful of times last season in the outfield. Now the only question is, which cleats do I buy? Obviously, the hot pink Jennie Finch Mizunos are out of the question. Why aren’t baseball cleats as cool as soccer cleats?</li>
<li>Run outdoors more often. Confession: I love the cardio machines at the YMCA, but the treadmill can suck it. Now that I’ve discovered how pleasurable it is to run outside when it’s above 20 degrees, I don’t think I’ll set foot on the blasted belt again. If all goes according to plan, I’ll start this season in shape and injury free&mdash;the first time I’ve been able to say that in, well, 12 years or more.</li>
<li>Master the inside out swing. Who knew Rod Allen wasn’t making things up when he showed us Miguel Cabrera’s “classic inside out swing” on all those slow motion replays? High, outside pitches have been my bread and butter for the past 4 seasons, but one benefit of finally learning how to REALLY swing a bat means I am also learning how to send an inside pitch opposite field. Last week I managed to send one tailing sharply into right, and my coach said, “That’s how the big boys hit.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Between my “to-do” list and my training, I’m hoping I can tick a few items off my season-long list, like knocking one off the fence and hitting a stand-up triple.</p>
<p>Stand-up, of course, because I’ll want to keep the new cleats clean.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong><br />
A few days ago, Tim Carmody sent James Fallows&#8217; wonderful <a target="new" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1996/08/throwing-like-a-girl/6152/">&#8220;Throwing Like a Girl&#8221;</a> my way. In typically superb Fallows form, he unpacks and challenges what it means to &#8220;throw like a girl,&#8221; and why, if it&#8217;s not exactly gender specific (because plenty of women throw correctly) it&#8217;s still largely female examples we see when we think of &#8220;throwing like a girl.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For young boys it is culturally acceptable and politically correct to develop these skills,&#8221; says Linda Wells, of the Arizona State softball team. &#8220;They are mentored and networked. Usually girls are not coached at all, or are coached by Mom&mdash;or if it&#8217;s by Dad, he may not be much of an athlete. Girls are often stuck with the bottom of the male talent pool as examples. I would argue that rather than learning to &#8216;throw like a girl,&#8217; they learn to throw like poor male athletes. I say that a bad throw is &#8216;throwing like an old man.&#8217; This is not gender, it&#8217;s acculturation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong><br />
Confession: I play softball in a skirt. A running skirt, to be precise, and it&#8217;s positively the most comfortable, least restrictive article of clothing I own. (I have a nice pair of softball pants&mdash;black, always worn pulled up to the knee&mdash;but they make me feel somehow like the Tin Man; I can&#8217;t bend correctly at the waist. I only wear them when it&#8217;s too cold for anything else.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&#8217;m becoming accustomed to the strange looks I draw when I drop my bat and bag and start stretching as my coach is finishing up with the young man who takes lessons before me. I suppose I&#8217;d just attributed it to the skirt.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong><br />
<a target="new" href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/11/16/its-looking-like-a-limb-torn-off/">We&#8217;ve already talked about my throw.</a> It&#8217;s never been girly. Now, it&#8217;s even less so.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong><br />
This week, the young man&#8217;s father, a chatty BS-er who&#8217;s always ribbing his son and the coach, said something to the effect of, &#8220;You teach softball too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, before we continue, I have to say, I couldn&#8217;t tell if the question was one of derision. I could not tell if he meant it as a slight to my coach, as though somehow he was making easy money by working with me. As though he were less manly for teaching a girl&#8217;s sport, something I saw all the time when the men coaching women&#8217;s sports in high school were dismissed as shitty coaches because a real coach would coach men.</p>
<p>All I know is that it made me a bit mad.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong><br />
Because a woman playing a sport seriously, even if somewhat ridiculously (i.e. a 30-year-old woman spending her Friday nights taking grounders and tearing her palms open in the cages), doesn&#8217;t seem to me to be preposterous. </p>
<p>As in, boys can take baseball lessons. So why is it weird for me to do the same?</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong><br />
My coach, who I will forever high-five for this, said, &#8220;Nope,&#8221; then explained that he was giving me baseball lessons with bigger balls. He added that I&#8217;m his only female client, and he took me on because I asked. </p>
<p>I realize I was standing there in a skirt, but it doesn&#8217;t sit well with me to have someone speak about me in front of me. It reminds me of being a child and having the doctor explain what&#8217;s wrong with you to your mother, even though you&#8217;re sitting right there. </p>
<p>So I told the father that this was just my mid-life crisis, but quite a bit early. Then I stepped into the cages and started taking my swings.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong><br />
Reading the Fallows piece, I started remembering things I&#8217;d seen, but been too exhausted&mdash;or too hellbent on making a perfect throw&mdash;to fully process.</p>
<p>Last week it was a crowd of older men who had just dropped their kids off at the bounce-house place next door, making sort of cat-call, sort of awe-struck noises as I was hitting. Think more &#8220;Hey-O!&#8221; and less &#8220;Oh, wow.&#8221; </p>
<p>But thinking back, it seemed like they were half shocked that I was hitting so well (they shouldn&#8217;t have been; my coach is amazing) and half like they were offering some smarmy play-by-play to each other, the kind you half-hear walking by a crowd of drunk 40-year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong><br />
Look, I get that it&#8217;s a bit of a spectacle. The parents have never seen a girl taking lessons. The bored adults waiting for the kids to finish bouncing their brains silly in the bounce house emporium wander over to the field and are not expecting to see a girl in a skirt taking grounders or crushing the ball. I get it.</p>
<p>But do they do the same thing, act the same way, when it&#8217;s a boy? What would they do if it were their daughter?</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong><br />
The other possibility: I read the Fallows piece, and became overly sensitive (&#8220;girly&#8221;) about something that wasn&#8217;t even about me. Like a hyper-reactive feminist with a very self-centered world view.</p>
<p><strong>10. </strong><br />
It&#8217;s a lifetime of the same pattern, though. Time after time, making a cogent argument about an athlete or some sporting issue in the presence of men is not taken as another fan entering the debate, but as some type of exhibition that must be possessed. As though I&#8217;m doing it to get men&#8217;s attention. (I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m married.) As though that were the trick. As though a woman cannot love baseball, unless she loves it to get a man. </p>
<p><strong>11.</strong><br />
My freshman year of high school, we were bussed out to Durand with the boys&#8217; freshman team. The boys, it turned out, didn&#8217;t have an opponent. Midway through the first game, the umpire suggested to our, Mr. Young, that we play to five innings and skip the second game to accommodate the boys. Mr. Young went nuclear.</p>
<p>He came back to the dugout and told us, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever let someone treat you differently just because you&#8217;re a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong><br />
In co-ed, rec league softball, girls are pitched a smaller ball. My coach, from day one, has been pitching me the boy balls. But we just call them what they are: the big balls. Because girls can have them too.</p>

<blockquote><p>“He’s got a mean streak,” says his manager, Sparky Anderson. “As mean as Pete Rose. That’s saying the best thing that could be said about a ballplayer.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of weak aspects to my game – hence hiring a coach to convert me into a real, badass third baseman, aka #Project3B.</p>
<p>But despite <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/11/02/project-3b/">my affinity for miming the Rocky training sequence</a>, my adoration of <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/26/suggested-halloween-costumes-for-my-party-saturday-baseball-playoffs-edition/">complete badasses like Brian Wilson</a>, and my freakish ability <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/motheroflight/status/29592060227">to not notice somewhat hardcore injuries until well after the fact</a>, I still have a hard time with my game face.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I convinced (read: asked a few times, sweetly) my best friend Debbie, to join me in my #Project3B shenanigans. Of course, I had ulterior motives, including expanding the range of awesome milady performs on the field this summer. </p>
<p>Whereas the first lesson, I was Too. Fucking. Exhausted. to perform my standard “can’t go more than five minutes without cracking jokes” act (at least they’re funny, I’m told), Debbie’s presence was fabulous in a few awesome ways. First, I wasn’t the only one performing the drills, so I wasn’t So. Fucking. Exhausted. so fast. (Also, we learned that Debbie has a wicked arm and can field well. Holla, all-girl infield!)</p>

<p><strong>Coach</strong>: “Don’t get lazy, A, keep your ass down!”<br />
<strong>Angela</strong>: Fields grounder (barely), mutters under breath, “That’s what she said.”<br />
<strong>Debbie</strong>: (Quietly) Actually, that’s what he said.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah. Maybe it’s conditioned, partly, in girls&mdash;even girls like me, who regularly wear 3 to 4-inch heels, drink scotch, smoke cigars and are told by male friends, “You’re like a man in a hot chick’s body”&mdash;to take direction well from men with authority but feel the need to offset it with a giggle.</p>
<p>(I have also been known to respond to internal work emails with a well-timed “That’s what she said” as well.)</p>
<p>But it all begs the question: can I become a great (or hell, just plain better than 80% of my competitors) co-ed beer-league softball infielder if I can’t be “mean” like Gibby&mdash;if I’m more likely to bite my cheeks to keep from guffawing when my coach, fixing my swing (another catastrophe, to be explored next week) says, “Don’t get stiff too early?”</p>
<p>I don’t know what it all means, kids. I don’t know how long it’s going to take for me to be more “Hearts on Fire” and less Weird Al’s “I’m Fat,” but it’s safe to say it’s more than two sessions with the coach. Whose nice silver watch, incidentally, helps me focus when I’m trying to override my inane urges. </p>
<p>(That’s what she said.)</p>

&mdash;Brian Wilson, Giants closer and general badass</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was a kid, the standard-bearer for bad-ass preparation tactics was the Siberian training montage in Rocky IV. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPbLzu83Ato?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>My brother and I would string a jump rope across the living room and mimic the uppercut practice while playing “Hearts on Fire” on repeat. </p>
<p>Naturally, when I decided&mdash;admittedly, after many large chalices of beer at Art’s, a local bar&mdash;that I would hire a coach to transform me from a decent-to-good centerfielder into a larger than life third baseman, I pled my case to my husband thusly: “I can’t be Rocky without a Mickey.” </p>
<p>A few keystrokes into Google, I struck gold. It turns out the indoor soccer arena near my home houses the <a target="new" href="http://lansinghitclub.com/">Lansing Hit Club</a>, a travel team and associated instructional organization. If you scroll down, you’ll see my coach, Justin Pierce. He must be cool, because he agreed to coach a 30-year-old woman. Also, he’s huge. That, or I’m just the size of the pre-teens he regularly coaches.</p>
<p>People, it is Monday afternoon and I am still sore. People, when I ran 8 miles in July, I wasn’t as exhausted as I was after the first round of drills. People: It. Was. Fucking. Sweet.</p>
<p>How sweet? So sweet that when I took off the batting glove I wear under my mitt, it was sticky&mdash;because I blew out my index fingernail and it was bleeding. So sweet that I didn’t flinch when I misjudged a short-hop grounder (which, coach says, &#8220;you have to charge that, Angela&#8221;) and took it off the muscle just below my clavicle. Three bruises, one bloodied fingertip, many sore muscles (I figure I did the equivalent of one billion squats) and copious pints of Two Hearted later, I’m hooked.</p>
<p>Some immediate takeaways: Throwing sidearm, my go-to for tosses when I’m tired or rushed, is no longer permitted. We’re moving to an over-the-top motion, which cuts down on the tailing action of a throw over longer distances and, frankly, is way easier. </p>
<p>The fielding fundamentals I’m learning at third are just mind-bogglingly fabulous. (You’ll get a whole column on this soon.) Some early winners: You “creep” into position instead of hunkering down, so you’ve always got momentum. You approach the ball in a way that carries you toward first, making the throw easier and more accurate. And, the real money trick: judging one- and two-hop grounders.</p>
<p>We’ll also be videoing my batting, which I’ll hopefully be able to post here. </p>
<p>Everyone needs goals, and since I don’t really have an enemy whose picture I can tuck into the edge of my mirror and then slowly crumple just before we face off in April, these are mine:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to hit a triple.</li>
<li>I want to hit a home run.</li>
<li>I want to be a better third baseman than at least 80 percent of my counterparts in the two leagues I play in. Especially since “girl at third” = bull’s eye, I want to make it clear that my defense is not to be tested. Unless you want to be out.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll be tweeting my softball adventures and misadventures with the hashtag #Project3B; you can follow me <a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/#!/motheroflight">@motheroflight</a>. Look for updates on Fridays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps I am of the softball-playing age where I should begin to think of being put out to pasture&mdash;pasture, in this case, being the desolate expanse of the outfield known as right field.</p>
<p>I have been a centerfielder for much of the time since returning to Lansing&#8217;s beer league co-ed rec division post-the birth of my daughter. For the most part, I have enjoyed it&mdash;even reveled in it.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1293" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1293" data-attachment-id="1293" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/10/19/the-hot-corner/bo-jackson/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg" data-orig-size="496,294" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bo-jackson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=496" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300&#038;h=177" alt="Bo Jackson" title="bo-jackson" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-1293" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300&amp;h=177 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=150&amp;h=89 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg 496w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1293" class="wp-caption-text">Bo knows avascular necrosis.</p></div> Except this year. I&#8217;m bored. Tracking fly balls is less thrilling, and more, well, blah. My focus isn&#8217;t there, and my joints aren&#8217;t a fan of sprinting across uneven, mole-hole filled terrain. Especially this fall, as I&#8217;ve been suffering from what seems to be a hip pointer. (Which is, as I described it to the man in the convenience store, the injury that took Bo Jackson from two-sport pro athlete to retired trivia subject pretty quickly.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for a new challenge. Or looking to recapture the potential I had in my youngest days, when my first fast-pitch coaches would place me at third (which then seemed insulting, as we all wanted to play first) because I had the arm, even then, to make the throw. (Even then, I was tossing the ball with a modified sidearm motion.)</p>
<p>I did play most of one co-ed season&mdash;my first back in action&mdash;at third. That wasn&#8217;t a particularly shining effort, but now I&#8217;m ready to give it the old Little League try all over again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to start training. (Heck, it&#8217;ll also lead to some great blog fodder, right?) Beginning as soon as I find a willing trainer (the Mickey to my Rocky), I am spending the off-season fielding grounders, learning to dive (eek!) and, really, hoping to make myself the most Brandon Inge-like 3B in a skirt in Lansing.</p>
<p>Aside from ordering the Tom Emanski videos, what should I do? Who should be my Mickey? How do I become a great co-ed 3B? What else do I need to do?</p>
<p>Answers, please. This is going to be painful either way&mdash;but perhaps I can augment that with just a little fun.</p>
