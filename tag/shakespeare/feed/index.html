										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So as I pointed out <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/12/shakespeare/">last month</a>, there are some great (and some not-so-great) films of Shakespeare’s plays. But sometimes you don’t feel like watching Shakespeare. Sometimes, you want to watch something a bit different. So, for those nights, here are some adaptations that offer Shakespeare with a twist, with a little bit of something for everyone.</p>
<p>Do you want your Shakespeare adaptation &#8212;</p>
<ul>
<li>to be high-brow? Try <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_King_is_Alive/60020495" target="_blank">The King Is Alive</a>, a 2001 film from the Dogme 95 group in which a group of tourists stranded in the Namibian desert decide to stage <em>King Lear</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be low-brow? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Strange_Brew/60024403" target="_blank">Strange Brew</a> is for you. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as the cult Canadian duo Bob and Doug McKenzie star in this bizarre and fabulous 1983 adaptation that marries a love of beer and all things Canadian with <em>Hamlet</em> and results in a whole lot of deadpan hilarity.</li>
<p></p>
<li>full of snark? Then you need to join the <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> crew to watch Maximilian Schell’s 1961 performance as <em>Hamlet</em> in <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_Hamlet/60032692" target="_blank">MST3K: Hamlet</a>. As a bonus, this can double as high-brow if you mute it and substitute your own dialogue in suitably Germanic-accented English.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to babysit your children? Two different <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> adaptations are for you: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Romeo_Juliet_Sealed_with_a_Kiss/70057577" target="_blank">Romeo and Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss</a> (2006) and <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Gnomeo_and_Juliet/70140917" target="_blank">Gnomeo and Juliet</a> (2011). Why a play about teenage suicide is suitable for the under-8 crowd is beyond me, but apparently it is.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be about existential angst? You can’t beat <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead/60034967" target="_blank">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</a>, Tom Stoppard’s 1990 adaptation of his stage adaptation of <em>Hamlet</em>. On the other hand, if you think the undead are angsty enough, then perhaps <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Undead/70115436" target="_blank">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead</a> (2009) is more your cup of tea.</li>
<p></p>
<li>in the form of a western? Then mosey over to <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Broken_Lance/60010181" target="_blank">Broken Lance</a>, a 1954 adaptation of <em>King Lear</em> starring Spencer Tracy. Or maybe film noir is more your thing? Then try <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Machete/70147212" target="_blank">Machete</a>, a 1959 <em>Othello</em> set in Puerto Rico.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to include Charles Mingus and Dave Brubek? You can have that! <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/All_Night_Long/70142068" target="_blank">All Night Long</a> (1962) sets <em>Othello</em> in the jazz world. Not enough music? Try Placido Domingo in Verdi’s <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Otello/60026938" target="_blank">Otello</a>, directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1986.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to feature prisoners? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Shakespeare_Behind_Bars/70043431" target="_blank">Shakespeare behind Bars</a> is a 2005 documentary about prisoners in Kentucky’s Luther Luckett Correctional Complex putting on a performance of <em>Tempest</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to focus on mid- to late-1990s adaptations of <em>Hamlet</em>? You’ve got two to choose from! <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Royal_Deceit/60028447" target="_blank">Royal Deceit</a> (1994) and <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Let_the_Devil_Wear_Black/60031768" target="_blank">Let the Devil Wear Black</a> (1999).</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be violent and bloody? <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is your friend. Try <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Tromeo_Juliet/1066571" target="_blank">Tromeo and Juliet</a> (1995), <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Romeo_Must_Die/60000396" target="_blank">Romeo Must Die</a> (2000), or <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Rome_Jewel/70129151" target="_blank">Rome &amp; Jewel</a> (2008). The first one is from Troma, so mixes some camp in with the gore; the second is Jet Li, so brings home the martial arts; the last is a hip-hop musical that I haven’t seen and am not hugely inclined to.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be violent and bloody and without all the speechy bits but with the master of horror? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Theater_of_Blood/70147559" target="_blank">Theatre of Blood</a> (1973) stars Vincent Price as an actor who revenges himself on unappreciative critics by murdering them Shakespeare-style. And what could be better Shakespeare than that?!</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Werner</strong> has two sons, at least one job, and too many books to<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A confession up front: this post comes close to violating <em>The Idler</em>’s mandate to focus on things we enjoy. In another part of my life, I am a Shakespeare scholar. I write about his plays in performance, I edit volumes about the topic, I used to teach the subject regularly. In other words, Shakespeare is part of my working life, not part of my idle pleasure. Not only that, there’s a lot of Shakespeare that I find tedious. Given my research, I ought to find Shakespeare on film and video interesting, perhaps even enjoyable. But you know what? A lot of it is no fun at all. It’s just boring. It plods along, probably prettily, and much too respectfully.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I gather that there are people who like to watch Shakespeare films, who might even make a point of seeking them out. I’m not sure why they do that. Is it a love of the plays? A sense of highbrow improvement? General curiosity about how a 400-year-old play turns into a movie? Back when Kenneth Branagh was successful, that must have been at the root of it. But I’m here to introduce those people into a different world of Shakespeare. Yes, there’s a bunch of the standard stuff on Netflix. But there’s some great stuff there too, stuff that isn’t boring, isn’t what you expect, that uses Shakespeare to make a movie instead of using a movie to make Shakespeare.</p>

<p>I like Branagh’s <em>Henry V</em> okay; I like it better when I think about it in terms of the genre of Vietnam movies and what it might tell us about late 1980s attitudes towards leadership and war. That nice meta-moment when the film switches from the sound stage opening to the film itself? That’s nice. And it’s lifted straight from Laurence Olivier’s opening to his <em>Henry V</em>, with its shift from horribly inadequate Renaissance stage to open fields and movie technology. Both, of course, get this from the opening Chorus in Shakespeare’s play, who doubts the ability of the stage to represent the history at hand and so asks the audience to “Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.” In any case, both movies will give you a good sense of the traditional history of Shakespeare on film. And watching them together, if you haven’t done it before, will do much to dispel the myth that filmed Shakespeare needs to somehow be “faithful” to the play. These two versions play off of each other in their differences and you can’t ask for a better demonstration of how every performance of Shakespeare is shaped by the cultural moment that creates it.</p>

(Never assume that a Shakespeare professor will be more rigid in her adherence to the play than the general public; we are much less bardolatrous than you think.) Try Derek Jarman’s 1979 <em>Tempest</em> for a taste of this. The film isn’t unexpected for what it does to the plot, but how it goes about moving through it. With the punk singer Toyah Willcox as Miranda, radical playwright and poet Heathcote Williams as Prospero, blind dancer Jack Birkett as Caliban, and the island setting replaced with a decaying mansion, Jarman’s movie embodies a disjointed aesthetic that makes the play into something that explores power and the dispossessed in terms both of bondage and creation. I’d never had a chance to see it before I found it on Netflix, and though I meant just to watch the opening scenes to get a taste of it, I watched the whole thing through, never quite sure what was going to happen next. (If you’re still doing the DVD thing, consider watching Jarman’s film of Marlowe’s <em>Edward II</em>. It’s amazing, both for how it uses the play as a jumping off point for an argument for queer politics and for its bare yet glamorous aesthetic.)</p>
<p>Peter Brook’s 1971 <em>King Lear</em> is a different sort of film. It’s professional in a way that Jarman was not interested in, with some truly great actors in the lead roles: primarily Paul Scofield as Lear, but also Irene Worth as Goneril and Cyril Cusack as Albany. Brook himself is one of the most important theatre directors of our age, and an even more outsize influence in Shakespeare productions. So its pedigree puts it in company of all those other pretty and respectful films I find dull. But this is separated from others in its genre by its relentless cruelty. <em>King Lear</em> is a hard play, so much so that it can be difficult to stomach. Everyone’s treatment of everyone else is painful to watch, and their deaths are worse and worse. It’s tempting for productions to play on our sympathy—poor old Lear, such cruel thankless children. And poor pitiful Cordelia, so innocent and poorly used. But this film doesn’t wallow in that sadness, nor shy away from the cruelty of the story. It is as brutal as anything I’ve seen. Right before Lear storms with his 100 men out of Goneril’s home, he turns back to stare at her and she blanches in fear. She’s right to do so: he leads his men in a riot destroying her hall and spits a deeply cruel insult into her face. He doesn’t sustain his range. He knows he will be mad, and the madness comes. There’s no histrionics, no music to compound or assuage our pain. It’s just relentlessly pitiless. The movie is worth watching for Scofield’s performance alone; in combination with Brook’s power, you won’t know what hit you. Alas, it’s only on Netfilx streaming until October 15th, so catch it quick.</p>
<p>There are other notable Shakespeare films streaming right now, but I won’t discuss them in depth. I’m assuming most of you have already seen the Luhrmann <em>Romeo + Juliet</em> (the one with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes), but it holds up well and is worth seeing again; play it against the Zeffirelli version to see how times have changed. If you haven’t seen Olivier’s <em>Hamlet</em>, treat yourself to it; there’s a reason it was so influential and why we think of Olivier as such as great actor. Some of my favorites aren’t streaming (Orson Welles’s <em>Othello</em> is astonishing, and Alex Cox’s film of Middleton’s <em>Revengers Tragedy</em> is anarchic and wrenching) but the ones that are available will go a long way to washing that <em>Anonymous</em> drek out of your mouth. Maybe next time I’ll share some of my favorite adaptations, but if you can’t wait that long, I’ll leave you with this: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Strange_Brew/60024403" target="_blank">Strange Brew</a> is back!</p>
