										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I get bored of cooking. Actually, I often get bored of cooking. The idea of cooking one of the same five meals I have in rotation makes me just uuuugh and the idea of finding a new recipe and trudging to the store like a jerk to get all the stuff for it sounds terrible. In times of first-world crises like these, I turn to the Google doc I keep of various recipes to try. They’re all recipes I got excited about at one point, whether they seemed easy to make or insanely complicated to make (see <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/02/13/valentines-day-double-rainbow-coconut-cupcakes/" target="_blank">Double Rainbow Coconut Cupcakes</a>) or whether I just stumbled on them somewhere and they sounded delicious.</p>
<p>When I went to the list to try and find something, I realized that I’ve been fretting about graduate school too much to even update the list properly. It was mostly full of desserts. But near the bottom, I found a recipe I dug up online ages ago that I’d felt too intimidated to make. . . UNTIL NOW. It was a recipe from <em>Post Punk Kitchen</em> that modified a recipe in <em>Clean Eating</em> for <a href="http://www.theppk.com/2010/12/red-lentil-thai-chili/" target="_blank">Red Lentil Thai Chili</a>. I’d avoided it for so long because of the Thai red curry paste and the coconut milk &#8212; both things I’m not used to and thus terrifying. BUT NO LONGER.</p>
<p>The chili sounded like a tasty, spicy alternative to mix up your usual chili, and included some of my favorite things, like sweet potatoes, cilantro, and chili powder. The recipe also used a lot of canned things, which appeals to my lazy side. By the time I actually gotten round to making this recipe, I’d learned from my travels that Thai red curry paste is nothing to be afraid of &#8212; it’s super common and easy to find. Low-fat coconut milk, not so much. Apparently the makers of coconut milk want to keep that shit as high in fat as possible. I avoided a near disaster in Whole Foods where I almost bought the kind of coconut milk you put in your cereal, rather than the kind used in Thai food, just to find something low-fat.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of one of the commenters, I decided to cook the chili in my crock pot, rather than over the stove. I peeled and diced the potatoes, cut up garlic, and sliced the red pepper (leaving out the onion, of course). I sautéed the garlic and the pepper, then threw them and the sweet potatoes into the crock pot with the vegetable broth, lentils (I didn’t actually have red lentils, so I used green instead), and all the spices. It felt strange to be sautéing things at noon.</p>
<p>According to the mystery commenter, I was supposed to cook everything on low for about six hours, then add the cilantro and coconut milk and cook for another half-hour-ish. The problem was:</p>

<p>My crock pot was completely full. It hadn’t even occurred to me to measure this out and make sure it would actually fit. The actual, non-crock-pot recipe called for cooking the ingredients in a very specific order. I’d already poured them all in together, so there was no going back. I turned the crock pot on low, and hoped the stuff would maybe cook down a little bit, enough to add almost two cups of coconut milk.</p>
<p>It didn’t. Six hours later, the crock pot was, if anything, even more full than it had been when I started. I decided I’d ladle it out into my biggest pot. I had no idea how many cups my biggest pot could actually hold, so I just went for it.</p>

<p>To my amazement, it actually fucking worked, coconut milk and all. I let the soup simmer for another half an hour, until the coconut milk was heated all the way through.</p>

<p>I added a squeeze of lime, some salt and pepper, and a little extra cilantro on top. Mine doesn’t look as chili-like as the soup in the photo &#8212; the coconut milk thinned the broth out quite a bit. I was worried it would taste watery, but hot damn it was flavorful. I thought all the different spices and the coconut milk might make this a sort of flavor clusterfuck, but it was delicious. The lentils didn’t seem to be quite fully cooked &#8212; they hadn’t gotten as soft as I wanted. Next time, I’d cook this on high for an hour and then cook it on low for a few more hours. And cut it by a third. In order to get the more chili-like texture, I could always make it like the recipe actually suggests. But in the end, the reheated leftovers thickened up well. Following recipes is for squares.</p>

This isn&#039;t it, but it looks kind of like this.</p></div> Last Christmas, I received a slow-cooker as a gift. For someone as lazy as me, it was an ideal gift&mdash;I could dump a lot of ingredients into the pot for a few hours and come back with a cooked meal. Easy success. When I moved to Boston in January, I took the slow-cooker with me. It sat on the bottom of my closet for months while I attempted to get my life together. It was always the next month when I was going to cook with it, and then it was summer and hot soups didn’t sound so great anymore.</p>
<p>Now that it’s December, I decided to finally try my first slow-cooker recipe so it wouldn’t go a year without being used, sitting sadly on the bottom of our kitchen cabinet. I found a recipe for <a target="new" href="http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/three-bean-turkey-chili-56214.aspx">Three Bean Turkey Chili</a>. I originally wanted to try a white chicken chili, but I chose this one because I’m trying to save money and most of the ingredients are canned. Sometimes, money-saving -&gt; fancy cooking. Sometimes.</p>
<p>I’d never cooked with ground turkey before, but I know it’s healthier than beef, and whenever my roommate makes turkey burgers I want to steal a bite when she turns her back. The only thing that needed to be prepared ahead of time was the turkey, so I got really ambitious and aimed to get up before work, cook the turkey, and put all the ingredients in the slow-cooker to be ready when I got home from work.</p>
<p>Well, that didn’t last when the alarm clock went off on Friday morning. I rolled over and went back to sleep, and decided to save it for the weekend. It turned out to be a great decision, considering what happened on Saturday. </p>
<p>Around 1 in the afternoon, I lined up all the cans of beans I needed (black, kidney, and northern) on the counter and started cooking the turkey. When it was done, I went to get out the slow cooker out of its hiding place, and had to wipe <em>dust</em> off the top of the box. I dumped the contents out on my bed and picked up the User’s Guide. I’m the kind of person who actually reads them.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the slow-cooker needed a fair amount of babying to be ready for use. I had to wash the pot, and wipe the outer part with a damp cloth. Then let it dry. <em>Then</em> I had to pour in two cups of water and let it simmer on high for twenty minutes. Then let it cool. Then rinse the pot out. Then let it dry. By the time I was done with all the prep, I thought about putting the thing away for another year. But then I’d have to start all over.</p>
<p>By this time, the cooked turkey had been sitting out for awhile, and the entire process of cooking the chili began to seem unappetizing. What do you mean, I need to wait four hours for dinner? (I had originally planned on cooking it on low for about 6 hours, but by the time it was all ready to go, I knew I’d waste away with hunger before then). I dumped the turkey into the pot, and opened all the cans. Did you know the beans had to be rinsed? I learn new things about cooking every day. </p>
<p>Then I reread the recipe. One can (48 oz) of diced tomatoes. I had put in one can (14 oz). I was still in my pajamas. I thought about just going with it, but since the recipe didn’t contain a lot of liquid and said to use the undrained tomatoes, I didn’t want to skimp and risk burning it all. Leaving the kitchen a mess of cans, I put on tennis shoes and huffily walked to the grocery store. Yet another lesson&mdash;read the recipe carefully. As I stomped through the store, I had a moment of gratitude that I hadn’t decided to do this in the morning. Walking to the grocery store at 7a.m. was much less appealing than 3 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>After adding the rest of the tomatoes, I put the lid on and turned the crockpot on high. The glass lid fogged up, which was cruel for someone cooking in it for the first time. I was dying to see what’s going on in there, or if anything had caught on fire. But since the users’ guide was very specific about NOT lifting the lid, and because I’m the sort of person who listens to users’ guides, I resisted temptation.</p>
<p><em>Two hours later. . .</em> </p>
<p>My apartment smelled like my grandparents’ house. And that’s a good thing&mdash;my grandma is a phenomenal cook. Every Christmas, we have a soup dinner where she makes three different kinds of soup. Chili is always one of them, along with her often-requested noodle soup. The table is full of crackers and cheeses for topping. Everyone has at least three bowls.</p>
<p><em>Four hours later. . .</em></p>
<p>This chili should be called “Three Hundred Tomato Chili.” I’ve always had trouble with the texture of tomatoes, and I’ve only recently started being able to tolerate fresh tomatoes. I feel like all recipes should indicate the tomato-chunk to other ingredient ratio. Not everyone can love slimy, crunchy chunks of tomato.</p>
<p>However, the chili turned out quite nicely, with just the right amount of spice. The best part&mdash;I won’t have to cook anything for a week, at least. And I only had to clean one dish when I was done.</p>
