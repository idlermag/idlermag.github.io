<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>As a performer I&#8217;m known for my dark, out of the box acts—messy, outrageous, sometimes borderline offensive. I do have my moments of pretty, feminine acts, but on the whole I think I&#8217;m more known for pushing boundaries, and if I happen to come across as sexy while doing it, so much the better. My modeling tends to contain that same aesthetic, and I would say my sarcastic, black-humor-tinged outlook on life as well.</p>
<p>I have been seen in short films for Nokia, been featured on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, have danced with Natalie Portman in <em>Black Swan</em>, posed nude for foreign magazine fashion spreads, worn priceless designer couture with Q Models in fashion videos, walked the runway for impeccable gothic designers, shot fetish films in Newcastle, graced the stages of legendary NYC nightclubs, and so much more! It&#8217;s been a wild ride!  </p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m always thinking up new acts for my regular burlesque residency with Original Cyn Burlesque at the Lucky 13 Saloon in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I&#8217;m also looking forward to getting my foot in the door with new shows and venues &#8212; right now I&#8217;m excited to be performing with Geek Girl Productions again, for Edification for the first time, and of course with my favorite underground NYC party <em>TRASH!</em> at Webster Hall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been doing a lot of television and film work recently. I just did featured background work on a new show for HBO called <em>Spring/Fall</em> starring Tea Leoni and Sigourney Weaver. You will also be able to catch me on upcoming episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order: CI</em>, <em>How To Make It In America</em>, <em>Men In Black 3</em> and many more to come.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a dancer and performer?</em></p>
<p>I grew up dancing. My mother had been a ballerina and when I was old enough to walk, she decided it was time for me to start ballet lessons. I continued with ballet until well into college, when I took a break to focus on my BFA in Media Arts/Animation at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. A few years after moving to New York I started modeling, and a DJ gave me my first real “start” as a burlesque performer at the infamous <em>Rated X: The Panty Party</em> at Luke &amp; Leroy’s. I didn&#8217;t really know that I was doing &#8220;burlesque&#8221; per se &#8212; I had choreographed a dance number and incorporated some strip elements into it. After that I started gogo dancing at various downtown parties for fun, and then in 2008 I was approached by the amazing Fem Appeal who runs <em>Kitty Nights Burlesque</em> every Sunday at Bar on A. She asked me to debut at her show, and from there the ball started rolling. I was very lucky in the sense that people have been willing to give me a shot sight-unseen, or by word of mouth. That&#8217;s not always easy to do in this town!</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>“Go big or go home.”<br />
“A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.”<br />
“If not now, when?”</p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I moved to New York as a theatrical performer in 2010, having done shows such as <em>bare</em>, <em>The Wild Party</em>, <em>A Few Good Men</em>, <em>Side Show</em>, <em>La Cage aux Folles</em>, and more. I&#8217;ve also done drag for almost four years now, and have always had a passion for makeup &#8212; I even went to school in full face every day of my sophomore year in high school in conservative Cave Creek, Arizona. I&#8217;m 6’5” and both of my parents were models, so I got pushed into that as soon as I was old enough. I&#8217;m known for my strange personality, and for being kind while being dressed like a bitch.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>Right now I’m working on a few parties that I will be starting, and I&#8217;ve been altering and making a lot of my clothes. I have some offers for shows (theatre) lately that I&#8217;m juggling and can&#8217;t really talk about yet. I&#8217;m looking to start working on music more since that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m the most versed in, and I&#8217;m pulling a lot of inspiration from my significant other.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a performer and model?</em></p>
<p>I became everything that I am, and that I do, because it gives you a key to open minds and challenge people&#8217;s thoughts and beliefs. I like to make people question themselves because if we all plateau intellectually, we might as well be dead. Individuality is not only attainable by some, you just need to tell society to piss off and live life for yourself.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in hate, and I believe that “regret is like drinking a glass of poison and waiting for someone else to die.” I believe that if you want something you should go for it. And I believe that if you need to put down others to get to where you want to be, and if you keep hidden agendas and secrets, you don&#8217;t deserve to achieve your dreams. Live, love, and keep your chin up.</p>

<p><em>Nadia Aboulhosn’s self-styled photos have been featured on fashion blogs and sites all around the web, including teenvogue.com. Says Nadia:</em></p>
<p>I am known for pushing limits and breaking barriers. I am known for doing what I want despite society&#8217;s views and beliefs.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em> </p>
<p>My creative energy is focused on my fashion blog and my future career in fashion. I am constantly in competition with myself to outdo what I previously did before. I am currently in the process of building a portfolio to apply for fashion school in New York. I am looking to start my own shoe line, style people other than myself, and possibly start modeling. All in all, my desire is to eventually become a fashion icon and inspire people everywhere. I just got done with a photo-shoot for <em>Seventeen Magazine</em> that will be out in November 2011. They used me to model some of their clothes. </p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue fashion?</em></p>
<p>Designing and styling always came easy to me. Fashion is the only thing that excites me, so making it my career is only right. Through art, people are able to express themselves whether it&#8217;s  drawing, painting, or music. Fashion, to me, is another form of art. It is a way for me to express myself. </p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em> </p>
<p>Never compromise. Settling is never an option. Dictate your own life while thinking intelligently rather than emotionally. </p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I am known for bending the gender lines in a way no one has done before. My extreme ways of expressing myself are quite delicious to some. Some call me the &#8220;Master of Masquerade&#8221;, and I like that. I&#8217;ve been on the cover of <em>Quest Magazine</em> (Wisconsin&#8217;s LGBT Mag) and just recently took an artistic risk in my newest short movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqEwQCCA6Q0" target="_blank">&#8220;Angel&#8217;s Ashes,&#8221;</a> which was just released on YouTube. But most of my success has come from the internet, winning photo contests and such&#8230; so far&#8230;</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I aspire to take over the world. To act, to move people. Continue with photography and creating photos that twist people&#8217;s minds into endless questions. I aspire to be on the cover of national magazines and to help people find the courage to run with fire, come into their own and be truly comfortable with who they are.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a model, performer and artist?</em></p>
<p>I always felt like I wanted to make the world a better place. I was always the weird, awkward one that everyone was leery about. I scratched the walls of my small town until my nails bled. Now I&#8217;m exploring every possible facet of life and entertainment, and I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>Eat the brains of life! [laughs] Or:<br />
&#8220;Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well.&#8221; &#8211;Josh Billings<br />
&#8220;Be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love, work, play and to look up at the stars.&#8221; &#8211;Henry Van Dyke</p>
