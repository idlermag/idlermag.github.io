										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here’s a stat I’d love know: incidence of <em>fan</em> heart attacks during the NHL Stanley Cup playoff season.</p>
<p>I couldn’t even hazard a guess.</p>
<p>This year, in the first round alone, the playoffs have been a statistical marvel. The Bleacher Report lays it out pretty concisely <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1162781-stanley-cup-playoffs-2012-first-round-by-the-numbers" target="_blank">here</a>. Watching them is mentally, emotionally, and possibly, physically (depending on how you react under pressure) hard.</p>
<p>Playing in them? Obviously, a whole lot harder.</p>
<p>But how hard?</p>
<p>Maybe you could compare how hard it is to <em>watch</em> the Stanley Cup playoffs relative to other pro sports playoffs in terms of number of hearts attacks or beers imbibed or anxiety pills popped, if you were really bored, I guess.</p>
<p>But how do you measure the difficulty of claiming Stanley Cup glory versus a Super Bowl victory versus a World Series clinch versus an NBA title?</p>
<p>I’m not particularly interested in being a statistician, so I used to think it was pretty simple. In my brain’s version of Excel (horrifying to think Microsoft is in my brain) I’d visualize the min/max potential number of playoff games versus brutality of the game and pretty quickly come to conclude in favor of hockey.</p>
<p>Salary caps, the average wealth of teams, or number of active players per team would all seem to play some kind of role. But, in my unofficial mental calculation, I still wind up thinking the Stanley Cup has got to be hardest hunk of metal to win.</p>
<p>There are plenty of bloggers on the interwebs who would <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/88331-lord-stanleys-cup-hardest-trophy-to-win-in-professional-sport" target="_blank">agree</a>.</p>
<p>I casually brought this question up to a coworker who is a slightly more even-handed sports fan than me, which is to say he watches hockey <em>and</em> basketball. I do not.</p>
<p>After the NBA, hockey, he said, might be the next easiest championship to win. He waffled back and forth between the Super Bowl and the World Series being the toughest championships, but his metric stayed constant: repeat wins.</p>
<p>If a team can win a championship at least two times in a row, how hard can that trophy really be to win? Or so his logic goes.</p>
<p>According to his unblinking evaluation, here’s how the four major US sports leagues break down since 1970. Just to caveat, each league has endured some structural changes over this time period so the comparison is not without its, er, flaws.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions" target="_blank">Football</a></strong> has seen 7 back-to-back Super Bowl winners, most recently the New England Patriots in 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/worldseries/history/winners" target="_blank">Baseball</a></strong> has also seen 7 serial World Series champions, an honor the Yankees are still clinging to after scooping three in a row.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions#NBA_champions" target="_blank">Basketball</a></strong> has had 10 repeats, many of which were snagged by the Lakers, who accomplished the feat in 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>And then there’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Stanley_Cup_champions#Stanley_Cup_Finals_era_.28Since_1915.29" target="_blank"><strong>hockey</strong></a>, with 11 back-to-back Stanley Cup winners if you break up the streaks of teams who’ve managed to win more than twice in a row. The Red Wings, of course, hold the most recent repeat win from successes in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn’t see that coming either.</p>
<p>But even though hockey has more repeat wins than any other sport &#8212; though arguably not by much &#8212; I still don’t buy that it’s the <em>easiest</em> championship to win, as this metric would have you believe.</p>
<p>Which leads me back to this terrible habit I have of answering a question with another question:</p>
<p>If my definition of what makes a championship hard could vary so significantly from colleagues’s, what really makes a championship the hardest to win?</p>
<p>As I write this, the Capitals and the Rangers are <del datetime="2012-05-03T04:10:03+00:00">in double</del> going into triple overtime.</p>
<p>Sounds heart attack-worthy to me.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Remember last week when I listed my <a target="new" href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/05/happy-trails/">playoff predictions</a>?

No? Admittedly, the column was pretty long, and the predictions were slapped onto its end, well after your attention had waned. (It's probably happening now, at the end of this sentence. All these parenthetical statements wear you down, my high school English teacher said.)

Well, obviously, no one read that far/was in full possession of their wits when they got that far, because no one noticed my hilarious mistake (part Freudian wishful thinking, part Courvoisier.) 

Let's take another look:

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember last week when I listed my <a target="new" href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/05/happy-trails/">playoff predictions</a>?</p>
<p>No? Admittedly, the column was pretty long, and the predictions were slapped onto its end, well after your attention had waned. (It&#8217;s probably happening now, at the end of this sentence. All these parenthetical statements wear you down, my high school English teacher said.)</p>
<p>Well, obviously, no one read that far or was in full possession of their wits when they got there, because no one noticed my hilarious mistake (part Freudian wishful thinking, part Courvoisier.) </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take another look (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The Twins will continue to be a team good enough to win the AL Central handily, not good enough to make it out of the first round. <strong>Yankees in six</strong>, with A-Rod doing something douche-tastic in the fourth game.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Giants will fall prey to The Curse Of Barry Bonds’ Jerkism (and paying way too much money for Barry Zito) and will be dispatched by the Braves. <strong>Braves in 5</strong>.</p>
<p>In a battle of sweet red uniforms (my personal favorite) the Reds and the Phillies will take it to seven games. Much as it pains me to say this (because the Phillies are my National League team) the <strong>Reds will take game 7</strong>. Tear.</p>
<p>Everything is bigger in Texas, including the hype. A rookie closer and Josh Hamilton’s sore ribs won’t be much more than a speed bump for Carl Crawford, Evan Longoria and Matt Garza. These boys know how to win, and they grind it out. <strong>Rays in 5</strong>. Four if Longoria has a beard.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you guessed, &#8220;Angela made her predictions as though the divisional series were seven game sets, when they are actually five, what a jackass,&#8221; you are correct. </p>
<p>Five, as it turns out, is not the same as seven. (We&#8217;ll get to everything else I got wrong in a moment.)</p>
<p>But <a target="new" href="http://boston.barstoolsports.com/random-thoughts/why-are-the-1st-round-of-the-mlb-playoffs-best-of-5/">why shouldn&#8217;t the divisional series be seven games</a>? I mean, </p>
<blockquote><p>To say that it makes no sense that the first round of the baseball playoffs are best of 5 instead of 7 would be one of the gross understatements of our generation. Seriously how is this possible? You play a 162 game season and then you play a best of 5? It makes no sense on any level. Is it because of the weather concerns in eastern cities? Like two extra days will make that big of a difference?   It just doesn’t seem fair that you fight for so long to get in the playoffs and then you blink and it’s over.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know the comeback argument. &#8220;These guys are banged up, two extra games would put them over the edge, blah blah blah.&#8221; I&#8217;d counter with the recent <a target="new" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703843804575534102219239786.html">Wall Street Journal study</a> quantifying the actual amount of action contained in each baseball game (14 minutes) means these guys would really only have to suffer through an extra half-hour of action. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more. <a target="new" href="http://mlb.fanhouse.com/2010/09/30/time-for-baseball-to-get-radical-go-to-16-teams-in-postseason/">What if we cut a few games out of the regular season to expand the field of playoff teams?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of a 162-game regular season followed by three rounds of playoffs for eight teams, baseball should have a 148-game regular season with four rounds of playoffs for 16 teams.</p>
<p>Instead of limiting the first round to best-of-five&mdash;as is the case now&mdash;make all rounds best-of-7.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now you see why I made such a simple, stupid mistake – because, clearly, no matter how we do it, all rounds should be seven games. Heck, if the NBA did it, so can we. </p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look again at what I actually predicted. Subtract two from each prediction, and we&#8217;ll see just how wrong I was there, too. </p>
<p>Both the Twins and the Reds were swept, another great argument for expanding the playoffs to 16 and the series to seven. You better believe the White Sox and Red Sox would not have been swept. They may not have won, but they would have at least taken a game.</p>
<p>(Note: Atlanta just took the lead in the 6th. If they pull it out, I expect them to take game 5. Same with the Rays Tuesday – always bet with momentum). <em>(Ed. note: Sadly, wrong again. The Giants won and advanced to the NLCS.)</em></p>
<p>Anyhow, my silly mistake or no, it&#8217;s time to expand and extend the playoffs. Because the only thing better than playoff baseball and Roy Halladay no-hitters and creaky old guys pinch hitting for homeruns is more playoff baseball, more Halladay, more creaky guys, more October homeruns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Watching the wonderful new installment of Ken Burn’s <em>Baseball</em> (the original, I sheepishly admit, I have yet to watch), <em>The Tenth Inning</em>, a player mentioned something similar: the chemistry comes when you’ve been winning together, when you are all bought into the plan, when the games get tough and you all&#8212; each of you&#8212;grind out each at-bat, each pitch, to get the right ball to hit and the hit that drives in the run that wins the game.

That kind of focus and workmanship has been missing from the Tigers since, well, 2006. And it’s the kind of thing you don’t get by building, or retaining, guys for amorphous reasons, like “He’s a veteran,” “He’s a leader,” or “The sound of the ball off his bat is different, like all the greatest hitters the game has ever known.”

So the Tigers have already announced who is not coming back&#8212;at least, not at this pay scale.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Leyland is famous (in my mind) not just for his mustache, but for busting up the most clichéd sporting myths with curt quotes. (Never mind that he’s responsible for some completely original epic inventions, like the time he said in a mid-inning interview that that sound of the ball coming off a great hitter’s bat just plain sounded different. Amazingly, he was talking about Craig Monroe, who, say what you will about where he is now [out of baseball], could evidently ring the distinct sounding sweet spot with the greatest hitters Jim had ever heard.)</p>
<p>Jim says team chemistry is overrated; give him a group of guys who can win together.</p>

So long, pal. so long.</p></div>Neither Magglio Ordoñez’s winning smile, spectacular hair or even the way he came back to trigger his option in 2009 with a stellar end of season is worth the price of this year’s option&mdash;$15 million. Of course we’ll all always remember fondly his walk-off homerun, which sent the hooded Placido Polanco galloping and celebrating around third, and sent the Tigers to the 2006 World Series. My money is on Brennan Boesch ironing out his late-season batting issues and winning the job in right field. If Magglio does re-sign, I bet he’ll be primarily a DH supporting the everyday RF.</p>
<p>Jeremy Bonderman hasn’t pitched a complete season that I can recall, either suffering a “dead arm” or a legit blood clot or some variation thereof. He’s got good stuff, but, as doomed former skipper Alan Trammel would say, it’s the one bad inning that gets him. Every start. Too bad for him the Tigers can get a starter who’ll be hurt often and give up tons-o-runs one inning each start for much, much less than Bondo’s recent rate. Some National League team will get him at a bargain rate, and he’ll probably become a 5th (maybe 4th) starter of note. He’s welcome to Spring Training if he doesn’t catch on anywhere else, and if that happens, I think the bullpen is an option.</p>
<p>And goodbye Johnny Damon, whose single most important contribution to the team in this, his single year as a Tiger, was not his spirited defense of the city of Detroit as he spurned the waiver wire advances of the Boston Red Sox, but the time he convinced the bullpen, a few starters and some other position players to trim their locks into Mohawks. Wouldn’t it be great if he ended up back with the Royals? Or the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he could pick on National League pitching and hang out with new manager Kirk Gibson?</p>

I like long at-bats and turning two. Call me. Or my agent.</p></div>Probably Carlos Guillen should pack his bags too. Despite his willingness to play anywhere (platooning in the outfield, short stop, second, first when Cabrera was originally signed and then third when Cabs moved to first and no one wanted to apologize to Brandon Inge and put him back at the hot corner) microfracture surgery&mdash;which he had after the hard “break up the double play” slide that sent him to the DL&mdash;is no joke. It’s not promising to have anything in common with Greg Oden (well, ok, maybe ONE thing), and his creaky knees are probably never going to improve. Besides, I’d rather see Will “Busta” Rhymes and Scott “Don’t Call Me Grady” Sizemore have a metaphorical knife-fight for the right to play second. Frankly, I’d rather see Cabrera and Inge as the team elders, and the payroll down substantially to make room for a few new guys.</p>
<p>It looks like we can say welcome back to Jhonny Peralta and Brandon Inge (barring a contract impasse). Dave Dombrowski says the Tigs won’t chase a Cliff Lee-caliber player, but they’re looking for rotation slots 3/4/5 to be filled. One with Phil Coke. (And his spectacular sideburns.)</p>
<p>Perhaps in the coming months we’ll have signed Carl “The Perfect Storm” Crawford (ohpleaseohpleaseohplease), gotten word that Joel Zumaya will never be hurt again (I’m saying rosaries for that one) and maybe, just maybe, I’ll finally get a call back about being the Tigers bench coach. </p>
<p>One just can’t say for certain. But it will be something to look forward to, to tide us through the winter.</p>
<p>Quick hit playoff picks:</p>

Facial hair.</p></div>The Twins will continue to be a team good enough to win the AL Central handily, not good enough to make it out of the first round. Yankees in six, with A-Rod doing something douche-tastic in the fourth game.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Giants will fall prey to The Curse Of Barry Bonds’ Jerkism (and paying way too much money for Barry Zito) and will be dispatched by the Braves. Braves in 5.</p>
<p>In a battle of sweet red uniforms (my personal favorite) the Reds and the Phillies will take it to seven games. Much as it pains me to say this (because the Phillies are my National League team) the Reds will take game 7. Tear.</p>
<p>Everything is bigger in Texas, including the hype. A rookie closer and Josh Hamilton’s sore ribs won’t be much more than a speed bump for Carl Crawford, Evan Longoria and Matt Garza. These boys know how to win, and they grind it out. Rays in 5. Four if Longoria has a beard.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s the seasonal equivalent of Sunday dread, that moment as the last of the weekend turns into the first of the work week (or, years ago, fresh seven days of school) when you begin to feel your entire life weigh heavily upon you. Somewhere recently I read that Sunday dread is the bit of evening where you are nearly smothered by the choices you’ve made, and the doubts you have about them – should I have gone to grad school when I was young? Is it too late to become President? Why didn’t I try harder in fifth grade? Will we ever be the people living in the same neighborhood as Tom Izzo?

It's when September is just about out of days and the Tigers, God bless them, are officially, mathematically, scientific-method tested and retested and confirmed, out of the playoff picture. Again.

Somewhere recently I read that Sunday dread is the bit of evening where you are nearly smothered by the choices you’ve made, and the doubts you have about them – should I have gone to grad school when I was young? Is it too late to become President? Why didn’t I try harder in fifth grade? Will we ever be the people living in the same neighborhood as Tom Izzo?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s when September is just about out of days and the Tigers, God bless them, are officially, mathematically, scientific-method tested and retested and confirmed, out of the playoff picture. Again.</p>
<p>But it’s more than the end of the season. It’s the constant reminder of Opening Day, the (irrational) amount of hope and optimism gurgling north during Spring Training in the dispatches from the beat reporters in Lakeland. It’s the same as catching a whiff of summer even as the maple leaves are scratching across your shoelaces.</p>
<p>Austin Jackson comes to the plate, and it’s impossible to forget his first games, his first hits. Watching the Tigers dismantle the Twins this past weekend (ten runs? Where did that come from?) of course stirs up the same emotions roiling us off the couch and high-fiving in front of the television, exclaiming to no one when the boys would come back in the bottom of the ninth and you were listening to the game on the radio, covered in garden soil, spade raised triumphantly. </p>
<p>And yet it’s all tinged a little sepia, something like watching a film knowing the end will be tragic. The Tigers will take the series from the Twins, it will be impressive, it will be so much like June and those hot nights when Miguel Cabrera just seemed to will the team to win, when even Eddie Bonine had nasty pitches working and the bullpen was not what opposing hitters wanted to face.</p>
<p>It’s the Sunday dread, the nostalgia and the promise all still present – the taste of watermelon on the breeze when you’re buttoning your coat – and all somehow failed. The fabulous home record, the road trip disasters. The injuries, the sense of having wasted something – something perfect like 26 outs, something perfect like a Rookie of the Year season paired with an MVP. </p>
<p>We know what’s coming. The cold, the long tucking in until the snow drains away, the months of rumors and innuendo and tough decisions we can spend this moment, next year, second guessing. </p>
<p>Still, it’s not quite time. The Tigers might be getting ready to hibernate, but baseball isn’t finished. There’s an entire month left of hot tea on the couch, windows open, blankets swathing feet. Maybe it’ll be harder to burst from that cocoon while watching the playoffs, but if it’ll stave off the Sunday dread-esque feeling of knowing it’s almost time to tuck the cleats away, you better believe I’m ready to bring out my Phillies hat.</p>
