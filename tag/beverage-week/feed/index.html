										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beverage week. This is a music column. My drink of choice is tea, iced tea. I drink lots of it. Not quite buckets, not quite gallons, but I do drink my fair share. I love it. Ask anyone. My life is cluttered with glass bottles. Often I am like Stephen Fry’s portrayal of Wellington in <em>Blackadder the Third</em>. Not so much his order to King George but the sharp, singular way he says &#8220;Tea!&#8221; as he sends the man off. (the line is uttered at 1.21 of the clip in case you’re wondering)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTC9amNWwqU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>And so here are some songs about drinks for your viewing and listening.</p>
<p>Chris Rock’s track &#8220;Champagne&#8221; continued in his tradition of adding musical numbers to his comedy records. While I prefer 1991’s &#8220;Mother Has A Big Head&#8221; from <em>Born Suspect</em> this is a nice send up of the Hype Williams/Bad Boy records omnipresent media image in 1997/1998. Extra points go out to Nipsey Russel.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVjsllqa5Ko?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Read any of Henry Rollins’ work and you find a dedication to coffee. Read through his diaries about the days of Black Flag and you’ll find paens to the beverage and details of drinking Dunkin Donuts’ brand.  It does seem that as the band got a bit older, maybe more mature, that they focused in on something as easy to get as coffee. Why it was only a few years earlier when they recorded a song called &#8220;Six Pack.&#8221; I can’t find that video on YouTube but it is a fine, fine song about beer.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBWWxpiMTaM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The Beach Boys have been a nostalgia act almost from the time they stopped recording <em>Pet Sounds</em>, they are forever cemented into a certain scene and time and it really is unfortunate. 1970’s <em>Sunflower</em> is a lovely record, warm and open. One of the songs written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love is this track, &#8220;Cool Cool Water.&#8221; It almost seems too simple, a song by surfers about water? But listen at the work and try to let go of your assumptions and bias about the band. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mky-UhxUKoM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Kula Shaker were a mid-90s British band that embraced a lite level of psychedelica, bits of eatern thought, and the matronage of Hayley Mills. Their debut LP, <em>K</em>, was a solid disc surpassed by their long-titled follow up in 1999. Being that they were, at their core, poseurs, the band disappeared. I was enjoying their discs again when I came across this track, a 2008 free download. Any video starring George Orwell can’t be bad. It could almost, ALMOST, be my theme song.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5jTXdiBwas?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>But no, this, THIS is my theme song. I know squat about this fellow, nor do I want to. The whole of this song makes me smile, from the lyrics to the outrageously colonial outfits sported in the video. Is it about hot tea? Yes. But with some trays of ice, any tea can be iced. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/eELH0ivexKA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beverages have represented different things to me at various times in my life, and I find that my drink preferences can be easily broken down into clearly defined eras, each with its own, distinctive needs. Those needs were not always satiated, but boy, it didn’t stop me from trying using whatever was sloshing around in my glass.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy damsel: the early years</strong></p>
<p>Like most children, I drank cows’ milk. But growing up in Wisconsin, the land of milk and cheese, I drank it constantly &#8212; with meals and in-between. I lived a stone’s-throw from a number of dairy farms, and my local high school ran a yearly “bring your tractor to school day” for the Future Farmers of America students. The dairy farm nearest to my home also had veal cows penned right up against the road, where everyone could see. I saw tethered, baby veal cows most days of my first eighteen years of life.</p>
<p>During my childhood and adolescence, rBGH &#8212; also known as &#8220;recombinant bovine growth hormone&#8221; &#8212; was plentiful, unregulated, and pumped into milk at a record rate. I was consuming a great ton of milk then, and now I have a milkmaid figure and endometriosis. Just kidding &#8212; I’m sure neither is related. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>A fish called Wanda: the boozy years</strong></p>
<p>I was already a few years into sewing my recreational oats via other substances when something as unremarkable as alcohol began subverting it&#8217;s way into my repertoire with increasing rotations. I accessed it by the typical, teenage avenues at my disposal because I was eighteen; an age sometimes quite crudely referred to as &#8220;not old enough to drink, but old enough to swallow.&#8221; Soon I was chasing the day when I&#8217;d be able to down liquor that was not stolen, swindled, or combined from the ends of other people&#8217;s discarded drinks. In the meantime, I decided that drinking something I had just picked cigarette butts out of was part of my charm, and became a scavenger-goat for alcohol &#8212; a remora and bottom-feeder feasting on the booze scraps that of-age sharks had lost track of or left behind. When I had a choice or had convinced some poor sod to buy the man’s-ruin-fluid on my behalf, I opted for Bud Light, leaving me more calories for food, or Mad Dog, leaving me more money for things like gasoline and film developing. (These were the days before digital cameras.) By the time I moved on to straight vodka, whiskey and rum, I was almost old enough to buy it myself.</p>
<p>Eventually the way that I was drinking became less endearingly ribald and more&#8230; abject. So now I buy alcohol only infrequently, and then opt for indie beer with fancy labels, like a good little hipster. Although I will say that <em>Idler</em> music columnist and good buddy Mike Vincent recently turned me on to Dogfish brand beer, which is a slice of beer-heaven.</p>
<p><strong>Working stiff: the retail years</strong></p>
<p>So. Much. Coffee. This is when espresso finally made it to the midwest, so in fueling my lowly bookstore-assistant-manager positions, I graduated from giant, refillable styrofoam McDonald’s coffees to caffeine-loaded froo-froo drinks that came in matte, brown cups with the little corrugated condom-jackets. Somewhere along the way I switched back to plain black coffee again which was 1.) free at the independent bookstore I finally ended up at, and 2.) low-calorie, to correspond with the eating disorder I had developed not long after I stopped drinking like a sad lounge-singer.</p>
<p>In mid-high school, putting sugar and cream in my truck stop coffee like a silly, innocent teenager had been part of the fun in drinking it while I sat across from my friend <a href="http://theprojekt.artsprojekt.com/post/7655866383/artist-proof-interview-with-artist-kelly" target="_blank">Kelly Howlett</a> (who is now a painter and teacher), agreeing that being part of a creative community like the Beats would be totally swell. Cream and sugar lost their allure around the same time food did, and even though I now eat like a regular lady, I never really regained my taste for sweetened coffee. I still like my coffee black and bitter like a punch in the face &#8212; a reminder of where I came from, and the things I was forced to abandon to survive. Leave me my bitter coffee, oh irresponsiblity and excess, for you have already robbed me of so much.   </p>
<p><strong>Today and tonight: the writing years</strong></p>
<p>The combination of a slipshod lifestyle, a slavish debt to old demons, inherited predispositions and a wussy constitution has left me with rather cry-baby adrenals at age 34. I still drink coffee, but it’s a dysfunctional relationship to encourage. If I drink it, I don’t sleep. In fact, it’s 7:45 a.m. as I write this, and I haven’t been to bed yet tonight (uh, this morning?). I even took a little Rx downer at midnight to help motivate me to become tired, but I’m afraid that’s worn off now since it’s only supposed to last about six hours. Staying up all night to work is all too tempting when it’s work you care about, and when the words are coming easily like a new lover who thinks you’re something special.</p>
<p>When I am being responsible, I drink tea. It’s the perfect balance to give me enough pep to avoid passing out into my soup like a blitzed Montgomery Clift, but not so much that I stay up until eight a.m. trying to write my way out of whatever box I imagine I’m in. Fortunately, I love tea. When I was writing my novel <em>Basajaun</em>, I would drink a pot of green tea steadily throughout the day, and it kept me literarily lubricated and balanced, yet muted enough to remain still and produce. I view green tea as magical writing elixir, but for it to function effectively, I have to go into the day fresh, having slept the night before. That’s the bit that’s the stickler. When it gives you temporary results, it’s all too easy to pump your body with delicious, face-punching black coffee all for the sake of accomplishing work or avoiding the night. For Winkin’, Blikin’ and Nod &#8212; those rogue denizens of sleep &#8212; may not be as friendly when you’re heavily caffeinated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am mainly a beer drinker, but I like to say I am an “equal opportunity drinker,” so I will try anything once. </p>
<p>When I was prepping for my recent journey to the Keweenaw Peninsula (some 550 miles away from me in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula), I reached out a friend who attended college in the area.</p>
<p>He gave me a detailed list of destinations, attractions, and bars. It was more than enough to go on for my short visit. Then, a few days before I was to set out on my trip, he sent me another email. It contained a simple message:</p>
<p>“Go to Shute&#8217;s in Calumet and have a drink called a Moscow Mule.”</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6485" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6485" data-attachment-id="6485" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/09/a-moscow-mule-in-a-copper-mug/moscow-mule/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/moscow-mule.jpg" data-orig-size="500,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Daniel J.

Delicious.”</p>
<p>It sounded good to me. I’m a fan of ginger beer on its own, and bringing vodka to the party would only add to the fun.</p>
<p>Fast forward several days, and I was in Calumet with my girlfriend Steph, and we found Shute’s resting on a corner. It was an old, thin building—but long. It was built in the 1800s during the hay day of copper mining.</p>
<p>We walked in and were amazed by the interior. The bar maintained its Victorian feel and look: dark wood, murals, a glass awning over the bar. A young bartender asked for our order, and I quickly replied “Two Moscow Mules.” He seemed both pleased and surprised by the request, because we stood out like tourists. </p>
<p>I watched him make the drinks, and moments later, they were before us, in copper mugs as my friend promised. The first sip was glorious and refreshing&#8211;it was a hot, sunny day outside. The ginger and lime masked any flavor of the vodka, letting me know this drink could prove dangerous and sneak up on me. </p>
<p>We chatted with the bartender, as we were especially interested in the copper mugs. “I usually ask for a driver’s license to hold when I make those.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked between sips.</p>
<p>“We had a couple of them walk away this winter. And they are $25 a piece.” This price was later confirmed when Steph and I visited a nearby gift shop. </p>
<p>The bartender went on to share more about the drink: it is actually a double shot of vodka, which happened to be Five O’Clock, and he did a slow count while pouring. He had to use Vernor’s ginger ale, as real ginger beer was too expensive, and they were already undercharging at $4 a pop (Travel Tip: you can drink for cheap in the Keweenaw).</p>
<p>While we finished our drinks, the bartender shared some of the history of the bar, the town, and of the early days of mining. History was all around us in Calumet.</p>
<p>It was my first Moscow Mule, and it was worth the drive from Lansing. It will be a drink, and a moment, I will always remember.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re the first thing I think of in the morning. I’ve never smoked, but I imagine it’s a similar craving. Should I make a pot or run to the corner café? When my head is heavy with sinusitis, it’s impossible to lift it off the pillow.  On these days I need coffee to keep me from blowing my brains out.</p>
<p>If I drank the night before, I can mistake the dull throbbing for a hangover. But I rarely drink enough, unfortunately to be hung-over. If only I could drown my sorrows and my sniffles in enough Vicodin and very fine wine.</p>
<p>Gulp two extra-strength Tylenol from the bottle on the nightstand. When I wake up listening to the Pacific ocean in Mexico, I always feel better. It’s the sea air and the ability to blame tequila for whatever hurts.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine coffee life before Starbucks. When I travel to New York or Washington D.C., they feed my beast, quickly and conveniently. Here in the U.S., a four-shot, venti, vanilla latte is always around the next corner, never more than a few steps away.</p>
<p>When I lived in South America, it was Starbucks that I missed the most. It’s impossible to get a take-out coffee to save your life in Argentina or Brazil. In Buenos Aires, if you ask at a café for a coffee “para llevar”, that is, “to go”, they squint their eyes and give you a very funny look.</p>
<p>“To go? But why? Relax, sit down, take an espresso and then go to work. It can wait. ”</p>
<p>There is no driving and drinking in Latin America. Coffee that is. Only a foreigner would think about walking down the street with a paper cup full of espresso.</p>
<p>When I order my four-shot drink in Chicago, sometimes iced in warm weather, the baristas do a double-take. “Are you ok?” they ask. “Whole milk? Are you sure?”</p>
<p><em>Really</em>…If I order four shots of espresso, cut with a double dose of vanilla syrup, do you really think I give a flying tomato about fat calories?</p>
<p>Every once and a while I try to cut down. I hear caffeine is bad for women in all sorts of ways. But I’ve been drinking coffee since I was ten or eleven. My grandmother served it as a warmer-upper when we stayed over, in brown melamine teacups.  My mother fed it to all six of us before school on cold mornings.</p>
<p>The electric coffeepot is always perking at my parents’ house, even though now, because of my father’s heart, they drink decaf.  A percolator keeps the coffee hotter than a drip coffeemaker. And we always drink our coffee with half and half.  I just can’t stomach it with milk or, god-forbid, 2% or skim. My sister takes her coffee with Equal, a bow to a diet of sorts, but good old regular sugar is still my vice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I drink too much on an empty stomach at the office, my knees start twitching uncontrollably under my desk. But the absence of coffee in my life feels like an absent lover. My head aches, my limbs go limp, and I crave, too much, a pillow and my blanket to hide from the sunrise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gents, in grand Jack Kerouac fashion, I’m driving as we speak across Nebraska and Wyoming, headed for the land of fog and seafood and fabulous people&#8211;San Francisco. I’ll continue my post about my grandparents next week. </p>
<p>Because my family was never super wealthy and because they liked the kind of torture that only road trips with small children can provide, I’m an expert road tripper. It’s almost the end of the road trip season, and because we’re talking drinks at <em>The Idler</em> this week, I’m writing you a handy choose-your-own-adventure guide for all your road trip drinking needs. </p>
<p>A caveat before we begin: When I say I’m a professional, I mean it. No, we’re not stopping for food and then stopping an hour later for a drink and then an hour later to go to the bathroom. Sometimes, at work, I built my stamina by making myself wait until I finished a project to use the bathroom. I can go 8 hours. I suggest you woman up, too, because there’s no crying in baseball or road trips. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> (6 a.m. (but really more like 7)): My father liked to plan a really ambitious (i.e. really fucking early) time for us to get on the road. An hour later, after much rushing around and bickering, we’d actually be in the car. And then we always had to go back for something my sister forgot. Now that I’m older, I wonder if he didn’t con us by planning an hour earlier than he actually wanted to leave. </p>
<p>First drink: coffee. Whether you’re adult enough to want actual coffee, or whether you’re me who wants the chemical-filled cappuccino from a machine, get the sugar or caffeine to get you going. But get a medium or smaller, and get a water too. You’ve trained for this at the bar&#8211;pace yourself. You don’t want to peak too early.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> (10 a.m.): Drink half the water. It’s boring and sugar-free, but it will keep you from dehydration and a headache from all the sugar you just consumed. If you’re already complaining about having to pee, I will pull this car over right now. Not to pee, but to kick you out. KEEP DRIVING.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> (12:30 or 1 p.m.): Stop driving. Are you bickering yet? You probably want to get out of the car as much as I do. Find a Cracker Barrel or some other suitably adorable and artery-hardening place and consume away. The buffet is your oyster. Are you driving next? If yes, go on to the next step. If no, eat way more than your companion and skip to step 5.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> (12:30 or 1 p.m.): Drink anything you want at lunch except for coffee or alcohol. You’re driving, and there will probably be hazards like semis careening down high-grade mountain inclines and mothers driving minivans in the fast lane. More coffee will make you jittery and alcohol is illegal, plus you’ll fall asleep after having waffles and a mimosa. Skip to step 6.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> (12:30 or 1 p.m.): Drink some alcohol. Chances are, you’re probably annoyed at your companion or she’s probably annoyed at you, and it would be better if one or both of you were drunk. Since it can’t be both of you and you’re not driving, it might as well be you. Have some drinks. Take a nap. Go the eff to sleep. Go on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> (3:30 or 4 p.m.): Since your companion is probably not as much of a camel as you are, you’ll probably have to pull over at some disgusting gas station or another to go to the bathroom. Never concede who’s to blame, since both of you will end up using it anyway. To drown out the memory of what might have been alive in that toilet, get an Arnold Palmer or a Coke. Get something with a little caffeine&#8211;enough to get you over the midafternoon slump, but not enough to make you have to piss again. Repeat step 2, for the same reasons, then go on to step 7.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> (7 p.m.): Eat dinner at a safely mediocre chain restaurant because you don’t think your stomach can stand stand anymore charmingly deep-fried diner food. Did you drink at lunch? If yes, tough luck&#8211;it’s your turn to drive now. Drink water or Gatorade. Go on to the next step. If not, forget about that rabbit you ran over and drown your sorrows in an enormous and overpriced cocktail with a name you feel embarrassed to order. Go to step 5, then skip to step 8.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> (7:30 p.m.): This is your last convenience store stop before bedtime. Stock up on ill-advised snacks and prepare for impending philosophical discussions. Are you planning to drive past 10 p.m.? If not, skip to step 10. If so, now is the time for your last shot of caffeine. Make it count. Get something with taurine that speeds up your heart rate and is probably unsafe. My caffeine of choice is Monster, or Low-Carb Redbull if I’m feeling healthy. Go on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong> (7:45 p.m.): Buy good liquor or cheap beer for later&#8211;whatever you can find depending on the puritanical or not-so-pure liquor laws of your current location. Start thinking like Dean Moriarty and digging everything in sight. Rub your belly. Become thrilled by the sight of fireflies, the sunset over the Rockies, the old drunk hitchhiker, or the way the turn signal sometimes matches the beat of the song on your iPod. But come to grips with the fact that you’re actually more of a Sal Paradise. Hide the unopened bottles in the trunk, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10</strong> (Whenever you feel like you might lose your mind and you start hallucinating that every tree or highway stake is a human being about to jump into the road): Find a hotel. Look for freeway exits with lots of lights and a hotel with a name you recognize. Stay away from hotels with only semi trucks or any including the word “discount.” Did you buy alcohol? If not, skip to step 12. If so, go on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 11</strong> (You’ve lost track of time by this point): Slip the liquor or beer into a pillowcase and drag in your suitcases. Try to ignore how exhausted you feel. Sit cross-legged on one of the beds and pass the bottle back and forth. Start talking and tell secrets you meant to keep. Forget what you were saying and watch as your train of thought goes flying away without you. Keep talking. Keep drinking. If you’re conscious, go on to the next step. If you’re not, get conscious. I’ve written no more steps for you and you’ll be lost in the adventure void.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12</strong> (&#8230;): You’ve turned on the hotel TV and are watching infomercials and considering purchasing the Super Extra Heavy Duty Magic Slap ‘n’ ChopMaster. You’re boring and tired. Go to bed. In the morning, go on to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13</strong>: Repeat steps 1-12 as many times as necessary to get where you’re going. I’m going to San Francisco. Meet me there and we’ll dig the town together.</p>
