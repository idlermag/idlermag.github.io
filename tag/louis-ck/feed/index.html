										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em> was a big deal for Louis C.K. Sure, anyone who hosts at least seems to realize the import of their insertion soundly into popular culture through this practice, but I still imagine this experience was a little more stirring for someone like Louis. Unlike a trendy young starlet, quirky pro athlete, or multi-talented musician, C.K. is a comedian; when he walks into Studio H8 he’s entering the hallowed halls of the comedians that came before him. There’s a precedent. There’s history. There’s awe. At the New York Public Library’s memorial for George Carlin, C.K. remembers his first aware, intense, and moving fit of laughter as brought forth by Carlin on <em>SNL</em>. <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/george-carlin-monologue-2/268365/" target="_blank">“What do dogs do on their day off? They can’t lie around &#8212; that’s their job&#8230;”</a> In relating this story of a joyful first, he makes a personal connection to that man and that show, through laughter, as the point in which he knew he wanted to be a comedian. This link to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> alone is huge, then add on top of that the disastrous effects of Sandy on New York and boy does the ante get upped. </p>
<p>In an email to his fans, Louis writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness. It can&#8217;t even be called a trip through time, because as long as new york has lived, its been lit. By electricity, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene. But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, to walk through the heart of it and feel like, in a way, it was dead. I can&#8217;t tell you how that felt.</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on in his letter to relate that when he walks on for his monologue he’ll be thinking about the people of New York, the people from <em>SNL</em> who worked so hard to put together a show amidst chaos, and his place as a comedian and New Yorker in relation to these various communities of public and fans. A huge C.K. fan myself, I must say I was incredibly moved by his writing to us in his alone moments before the show started. I could picture him nervous, a little sweaty, and gracious. This is the comedian I love. </p>
<p>On a personal level, it also meant a lot to me that he did his monologue old school, and in typical comedian-style, he just performed some stuff from his most recent shows &#8212; material I was lucky enough to hear at the Masonic Temple in Detroit in early October. Not only did he share work I’d heard live, but he shared my favorite story. </p>
<p>The story entails Louis making his way through the airport and this little old lady falls down. Inveterate misanthrope that he is, he pantomimes watching the lady tumble as he looks appropriately shocked, but clearly hopes someone else will help her. Well, no one does. The onus falls on our anti-hero and he’s like, “great, now I have an old lady.” He ends up schlepping this ancient broad and her bags and her onion paper travel documents through the busy airport. Many jokes are cracked at her expense. Poor put-upon Louis! He just wants to be anti-social and this happens to him! And the extended story culminates with C.K. sitting and talking with the woman all day and he finishes his telling in a bratty rushed/hushed and disinterested manner with, “and it was so beautiful to meet her, and she changed my life or whatever, *eyeroll*.”  </p>
<p>I like this joke because it has heart. It’s not super mushy sweetness, in fact it’s mostly girded by Louis’ discomfort with people, especially people who are different from him (old, from another country, or at least culture), and his unease when circumstances push him into intimate moments with this other. It’s truthful, it’s personal, it’s not the kind of joke you’ve heard over and over. It explores everyday life and emotion closely and carefully and ultimately it peels back superficial layers of stalwart masculinity and the coldness of the modern urban citizen and finds more. It opens up a space for Louis and for men and for people in general to understand themselves beyond the labels that keep us safe and comfortable. This is exactly the kind of revelatory work I love to see Louis do.  </p>
<p>It was important to me to watch C.K. pluck this piece, from a show of really strong and probably more easily digestible material, for this super important spotlight moment because it showed me that C.K. is still interested in what’s difficult, what’s hard and what’s weird and that he’s going to keep growing. His most recent show was great, really strong, up there with some of the best comedians in terms of laughability, pacing, content, but there’s a “But.” As good as it was, it felt a little bland, a little vanilla. . . from Louis. From anyone else, just fine, but from Louis I expect more. More darkness, more anger, more gurgling pit of stomach, kid hating, shameful, edgy moments, or at least risk, vulnerability. Instead there was a bit of ease. Is it because he’s getting older? Is he running out of ideas? Or is the Louis of old gone now that he’s incredibly renowned and Emmy-winning, <em>SNL</em>-hosting, famous? I think Ricky Gervais hits it on the nose when he pinpoints Louis’ precise draw as, “this is a man falling apart for my pleasure!” What’s left when our man is fairly put together? </p>
<p>The show I witnessed was about men and women (Louis’ getting “a lot of pussy,” or going on a lot of “nice dates” depending on which of his friends you talk to), how awesome boobs feel, and how young thin white guys are the worst and pretty much get whatever they want while the rest of us are fucked, and not in the fun way. There were some strong humorous hypotheticals &#8212; what if it were legal for everyone to kill just one person? And there was a pretty great story about C.K. moving on up to a fancier apartment community and how one of the richies came over to question his presence on the property. This allowed us some moments of that gruff C.K. we know, he’s angry and he’s just hoping this asshat comes over and tells him something, tries to kick him out. The audience digs in and thrills at the thought. . . ooooh, it’s gonna be good when Louis gets pissed! And he does! And it’s awesome, but then the disclaimer: none of this actually happened. The dude came up and said hi to Louis like he belonged there. Good story and all, but I think it also highlights his easier life and further separates us from him. Louis was the guy who was always getting shit on and we could commiserate with that, now he’s the guy in tuxedos, on the TV, in the fancy apartment. His fantasy of not belonging makes a lot of sense as a way of clinging to who he was and feeling a little unsure of how to deal with who he’s becoming. </p>
<p>I was starting to think maybe this was the case. Maybe Louis is fattening up on the good life and leaving me and all the other lonely ones behind with all our weirdness. I comforted myself with the idea that maybe his absurdist show provides him enough of an outlet for mining the abject and that leaves his stand-up room to take on a new shape (which is fine, even if it’s not as challenging or interesting to me). But then, he went on <em>SNL</em> and he didn’t talk about boobs, or dating, or dudes, or wanting to kill people. He talked about little old ladies, and that made me think that maybe everything with me and Louis is going to be all right. And by all right I mean strange, uncomfortable, and difficult ever after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Louis C.K. is a forty-something year old divorced dude comedian with two kids.  He lives in New York City, he hates a lot of stuff, he’s perennially grumpy, and he’s quickly become one of my favorite comedians. . . like, of all time ever in the universe.  Serious business.</p>
<p>I thought it might be nice, this Valentine’s week, to discuss what I love about Louis.  I used my analytical super powers for this one, so don’t expect a sonnet to his freckles or his sadly tonsured crown, but an elevation of his craft.  Said elevation follows thusly:</p>
<p>Though his stand-up persona carries himself with a fairly typical brand of New York male bravado and “this world is fucking stupid” existentialism, C.K.’s performative work is perforated with extensive self-hatred &#8212; hatred that he links both to his biological maleness along with the hegemonic infrastructure of a society that creates men like him.</p>
<p>In form, he suggests that he’s the same old ornery comedian; paunchy in his black t-shirt he’s comfortably average.  Unsurprisingly, he talks about typical dude stuff, subject matter ranging from having balls and obsessing about sex and women to smoking joints and obsessing about sex and women.  In content, however, his rantings fill in this typical masculine outline with an atypical questioning of male and white privilege.  And funnily enough, it’s his portrayal of himself as abject that most caught my loving eye.</p>
<p>On stage and on screen (in his F/X show <em>Louie</em>), C.K. depicts himself as disgusted by his body &#8212; its girth, his baldness, its (in)ability to have sex.  He despises his desires &#8212; to eat, to masturbate, to acquire friendships, girlfriends.  The unique strength of his self-loathing is that, in his delivery, C.K. sounds like any unquestionably average masculine man.  The gruffness, the register of his voice, his posture, diction, and dress all suggest that as an American male he is typical.  But within the Trojan horse of normativity, bursts forth a troop of more realistic, but rarely discussed failures and sick expectations of masculinity.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zvObs80OqWY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Louis will lift his shirt and expose his lily white belly to the crowd, or build an entire episode of his TV show around his stupefying depression &#8212; the loneliest orgy between a man and multiple pints of Häagen-Dazs that you’ll ever see.  Our everyday dude emasculates himself through confession and this is not, as we’ve been taught, a bad thing.  Through his intensely detailed self-deprecation, C.K. creates a safety net for his audience.  Targeting himself with the heft of his ire, the viewer feels safe to laugh. Rather than appearing too academic or authoritarian in his beliefs about institutions and hegemonic power, he disarmingly deconstructs our privileged models of masculinity by sloughing them off of himself through his performances.</p>
<p>He says, “look at this shitty body, this shitty brain that reduces women to pussy.  Look at me, this fuck-up, this racist, this homophobe, this fat American failure.”  And he lets us look really closely.  Getting naked before us as Louis C.K. the super specific individual person, but narrated by the voice of Louis C.K. Every(dumfuck)man, he builds a powerfully uncomfortable and thus hilarious tension, one capable of complicating our notions of gender and shaking us a little freer from our socially constructed roles.</p>
<p>Our Everyman sounds powerful, stands-up before us like a God, but he worries about his figure like me and every woman I know, his children hurt his feelings, he wants to know how to make friends.  On <em>Louie</em>, he kisses women (when he gets the chance) with an ardor and desire for connection so unbelievably and pathetically palpable you just want to slap the guy &#8212; for we all know there is no joy in Louieland, but the poor sap just keeps hoping/trying.</p>
<p>So, yes, in all of this he is un-manned; he emerges ugly, flaccid, fat, emotional, soft, and this is human, this is real &#8212; more real than the gendered lies we cling to out of cowardice &#8212; this is Louis, my funny Valentine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wasn’t going to like Louis C.K.  In all my infinite wisdom, I had him pegged without ever having heard a word from his act.  Angry New York (male) comedian.  Blah blah blah, Fuck this, Fuck that, I hate the world, woman as butt of joke, “foreigner” as butt of joke, fuck fuck hate, fuck fuck fuck, end of set.  But then, there was Louis on <em>Parks and Recreation</em> playing a loveably lackluster cop with the cutest crush on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler).  Cognitive dissonance set in.  I love Amy, Amy works with good people, Amy don’t take no shit (see moment where she takes Jimmy Fallon down a peg in Tina Fey’s memoir) and Amy appears to like Louis C.K.  Hmm…  Rather than relying on my well-wrought prejudice, I decided an investigation was in order.  Instant Netflix, stream me the F/X show <em>Louie</em> post-haste!</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6137" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/06/painfully-good-times-with-louis-c-k/louis-ck-fx-louie/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/louis-ck-fx-louie.jpg" data-orig-size="500,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="louis-ck-fx-louie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/louis-ck-fx-louie.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/louis-ck-fx-louie.jpg?w=500" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/louis-ck-fx-louie.jpg?w=640" alt="Louie" title="louis-ck-fx-louie"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6137" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/louis-ck-fx-louie.jpg 500w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/louis-ck-fx-louie.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/louis-ck-fx-louie.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Now, picture me nestled into the butt-shaped dent in my couch, slack-jawed in awe.  I’m generating fantasies of trips to New York doughnut shops in which I casually meet the man.  Daydreams of shared depression and little tubs of cookie dough ice cream.  Louie is amazing.</p>
<p>So, he is an angry New York (male) comedian.  But his rants turn inward, deconstructing white male privilege rather than projecting outward like so many comics do.  Beyond this, the depth, character and simple honesty of his work clearly sets him apart from the rest.</p>
<p>C.K.’s <em>Louie</em> so reminds me of modernist absurdist literature, specifically Sherwood Anderson’s <em>Winesburg, Ohio</em>.  Is that an assholey academic thing to say?  Maybe, but hear me out. Both the novel and the program are situated in episodic vignettes, compellingly-crafted peepholes into the sickly funny drama of daily life.  Anderson’s genre, along with C.K.’s, in my opinion, is deemed “grotesque” because their texts aesthetically produce a confusing jumble of emotional responses.  Like, being turned on by a cartoon character or laughing at your mother’s funeral &#8212; the affective output is real, genuine, but simultaneously shameful, wrong, disgusting.</p>
<p>In <em>Louie</em>, the camera settles on the ugliest, most personal, abject and/or just weirdest moments in Louie’s life and juxtaposes them with his stand-up.  The audience gets to experience the resonant pain and awkwardness of reality before and after it is channeled into art, comedy, a 5-minute set.  The comedy bits offer texture, little bursts of a confident persona, the man at work doing his job well.  We hear a bitter unwavering voice capable of breaking down the sum of a day into bizarrely shitty minutiae; this is the comedian with whom we’re familiar.  The meat of the show, however, offers the hard stuff, the dark stinky sewer that comedy rises out from &#8212; the actuality of feeling the feelings attached to the strangeness of being alive.  Jokes by definition tend to remove us from this plane, yet Louis C.K.’s work remains tightly anchored here.  He doesn’t want us to forget, he wants us to go there with him, to smell the stench while laughing.</p>
<p>He achieves this goal by insuring that his jokes are emotionally complicated, never easy. </p>
<p>In one quiet domestic scene, his sweet 5-year-old daughter reports that she loves her mother more, prefers being at her place, eating her food.  All the while, Louie is tenderly brushing his little girl’s teeth.  He listens politely, clearly dying inside with each barbed testimonial.  She spits and rinses and trots away.  He flips her off.</p>
<p>In another vignette, Louie, desperately lonely, hard up for sex and human contact meets another loner parent for no-strings-attached play.  But the woman wants him to fulfill the most banal roles of a husband &#8212; picking up odd items from the drug store, scouring the city blocks for a carton of blueberries &#8212; in addition to, if not in lieu of his sexual employ.  Once he can actually get close to her (she in her ankle-grazing granny nightie, Noxema-scrubbed face, hair in a ponytail), his embrace and kiss seem pathetically ardent while the woman remains stony, distracted.  She awakens a bit to request a spanking and upon receiving it calls out “Daddy” (you shudder with Louis) and then it happens again.  And again and again.  She bursts into tears clearly remembering some unimaginable incest or instance of rape.  Sobbing and silence.  Both characters share a room, a bed, but are inconsolably, distressingly alone.  The straight punchline: Sex shouldn’t be this hard.  But the queer subtleties of the experience scream so much more.</p>
<p>Jokes naturally want to deflect. They pour anger and hatred and repulsion into the shapes of laughter.  I admire and enjoy watching Louis C.K.’s stand-up, but especially his show <em>Louie</em>, because it has the guts to get naked, sorry, hopeless, wrong. It’s brave enough to skirt the laughs for a bit.  Sure, this can be sick sad and depressing, but so is the world and so are humans.  The genius behind this comic’s craft is that ultimately his truth, though acerbic, becomes touching, even comforting.  My darkest secrets become a little less dark after a bout of his storytelling.  Therein lies the comic relief.</p>

Wrote and directed.</p></div> A lover of words and sick of meaningless and overused hyperbole, Louis C.K.  would probably hate that I call him and his work “amazing.”  I hear him in my ear: “is it?  Is it really amazing?  You’re dazzled to the brink of insanity over my bald freckled head and my fuckin’ black t-shirts?”  And I respond, “Yes.”  Anyone who can make me feel feelings and wrote the movie <em>Pootie Tang</em> deserves my utmost freaking respect.  After all, literary fancypants Sherwood Anderson could only do one of those things.  </p>
