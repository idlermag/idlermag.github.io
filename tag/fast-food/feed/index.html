										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love delivery. Not only does it speak to my eternal laziness, but it makes me feel connected. It&#8217;s like getting mail, only faster and thus better. And so often, the things that one can get delivered are the great guilty pleasures &#8212; pizza, cupcakes, inexpensive Chinese food.</p>
<p>And now, apparently, Burger King.</p>
<p>Shortly after I moved into my new apartment, a flier showed up on my door announcing that I was part of Burger King&#8217;s new delivery area. (There are currently 7 stores in Maryland and 3 in Virginia offering delivery, with 6 more in Virginia starting up by the end of the month.) Normally, if a fast food hamburger isn&#8217;t enough to drag me out to a drive-through, then delivery doesn&#8217;t sound much better, but the flier promised new packaging to keep everything crisp and hot. This past summer, Alexis Madrigal wrote about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/07/the-3-big-advances-in-the-technology-of-the-pizza-box/242116/" target="_blank">the technology involved in pizza delivery packaging</a>, so my curiosity was piqued enough to give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>12:08p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I put in the order. The preferred ordering system is online, although there is a phone number. The minimum order in my area is $10, which isn&#8217;t terribly convenient for one person. I order a Whopper combo (fries and a 20 ounce bottled soda), say yes to the suggested add-on chocolate pie, and add a side order of onion rings. This brings my total to $9.96, an aggravating four cents short of the minimum order. I add a one dollar side salad to push my total to $10.96. I knew when I took on this experiment that I was going to be ordering a lot of food, but this is still a bit intimidating.</p>
<p>And then, adding to the frustration of $9.96 not meeting the minimum order, the additional charges get added on. There&#8217;s sales tax, and a two dollar delivery charge &#8212; which the order form takes pains to clarify &#8220;is not a tip.&#8221; My official total comes to $13.51. I decide to give a two dollar tip, bringing my grand total to $15.51.</p>
<p><strong>12:38p.m.</strong></p>
<p>While the email I receive to confirm my order doesn&#8217;t promise a specific delivery time, the flier indicated that Burger King shoots for a 30-minute delivery. They don&#8217;t make it. I&#8217;m not really upset about this, but I am really hungry, and I&#8217;m trying not to snack on the food that&#8217;s already in my apartment. Which is probably better than the mountain of food that&#8217;s on its way. 30 minutes is probably too fast to expect for normal delivery, but it may also be too long to have to think about whether this experiment is really a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>12:41p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The food arrives, and it&#8217;s actually close enough to the 30-minute window that I should probably credit it as on time. (I actually have to interrupt my notes on whether the experiment was a good idea in order to get the door.) Somewhere along the way, a phantom 32 cents was added on to my order, but I chalk it up to an error in calculating the tax (two days later, I still can&#8217;t figure out how either $13.51 or $13.83 makes sense), and don&#8217;t make a big deal of it.</p>
<p>My order takes up two full bags, and this is what it looks like spread out on the table.</p>

<p>The innovative packaging, as you can see below, is largely a re-engineered McDLT box, where the lettuce and half the bun are kept separate from the hot portion of the burger. It folds up cleverly, but otherwise, it just kind of makes me want a McDLT. (McDonald&#8217;s brings back the McRib all the time. Why not the McDLT?)</p>

<p>After putting everything together, I&#8217;m almost ready to conclude that Burger King should use the separated box for all its sandwiches. The assembled burger is easily the most visually appealing I&#8217;ve ever gotten from a fast food restaurant. Burger King in particular seems to try to see exactly how flat they can make your food before giving it to you.</p>
<p>But how does it taste?</p>
<p>In all truth, it tastes like every other Whopper I&#8217;ve ever had, which means that the packaging works well. The fries have congealed a bit in their box, but once separated, they&#8217;re surprisingly crisp. The onion rings are exactly the taste and texture of the ones I&#8217;ve had straight from the deep-fryer.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to escape the fact, especially confronted by this pile of deep fried food, that none of it is very good. I ate less than a third of what I ordered, and the chocolate pie was the only part that was actually kind of good.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the funny thing, at least for me, about fast food. If I&#8217;m away from it for a while, it has an almost magnetic appeal, but more and more when I actually start eating it I have to confront the fact that it doesn&#8217;t even taste good. I made <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/amys-delicious-turkey-burgers/" target="_blank">turkey burgers</a> for dinner that night, and I&#8217;m really not the sort of person to get excited about turkey burgers, but they were far, far better than my lunch was.</p>
<p>So the final verdict: If you&#8217;re a Burger King fan, you&#8217;ll be impressed with their delivery. They do an amazing job of maintaining quality from the restaurant to your door, and if you&#8217;ve ever eaten fast food french fries that are more than ten minutes old, you know that&#8217;s quite a feat. I, on the other hand, have had enough Burger King to last me a long, long time. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I travel so much that I’m now an expert in airports. I know how to tell which security line is quickest (those with people carrying briefcases, traveling alone, no kids), I know which airports and which terminals have the best food (Detroit MacNamara terminal = great food. Reagan International Terminal = not so much). And because I often fly on Friday and Sunday nights, I’m forced to eat that fake food that I spent all of <a href="http://http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/07/on-dieting-and-real-food/">a previous column</a> preaching about. </p>
<p>Here is a secret: I love fast food. Especially Wendy’s. It used to be a treat to myself that whenever I flew out of Boston on a Friday, I would get myself a hamburger, fries, and a baby-sized Frosty. Despite how much I like to joke about drinking beer and eating cupcakes and chocolate, I rarely let myself indulge, so it was a treat I looked forward to.</p>
<p>But then I started traveling every few weeks and I started to worry about an occasional indulgence becoming a habit and then the next thing you know I would need one of those motorized carts to get to the ice cream aisle at the grocery store to the checkout counter. </p>
<p>Here’s the main thing to think about when it comes to fast food: most of it isn’t healthy, no matter what they try to tell you. It’s <a href="http://bit.ly/cM4hSL">so chock-full of preservatives and sodium</a> that even something like a grilled chicken sandwich isn’t great for you. Keeping that in mind, there are some choices that you can make that will keep you from having a heart attack. Or at least major indigestion.</p>
<p>Tip #1: <em>Avoid salads.</em> Yes, you read correctly. Just because it’s a salad doesn’t mean it’s healthy. Fast-food salads might contain lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots, but they usually include iceberg lettuce, which is devoid of much nutritional value. And you’re lucky to have more than 3 tomatoes or cucumbers, and then not only is it not very tasty, it’s a really sad salad. I know someone who was “trying to be healthy,” so instead of ordering a hamburger, ordered a Caesar salad. According to Wendy’s nutrition facts posted on their website, a Caesar salad with dressing has 17 grams of fat. A Godiva dark chocolate truffle only had 6.5 grams. I’ll say it before and I’ll say it again: You’ll never see me counting calories unless I somehow need to lose a ridiculous amount of weight. However, let’s not delude ourselves. Putting bacon bits and ranch dressing and croutons on that salad isn’t making it any healthier. And after eating an iceberg lettuce salad, I’m left still feeling hungry and wishing I’d just gone with the burger.</p>
<p>Tip #2: <em>Avoid “value” anything.</em> I’ll admit it&mdash;I have a really hard time refusing deals. And rather than just getting a plain hamburger and a bottle of water from Wendy’s, why wouldn’t I spend the extra few cents to get fries and a drink? It just makes so much sense! The shitty thing about eating healthy (other than the fact that you have to eat vegetables) is that it’s more expensive. That’s just a fact. And while it might be just a few more cents to get that cookie or that drink that’s the size of your head, you know you don’t need it. I know I don’t.</p>
<p>Tip #3: <em>Forage.</em> What I mean by forage is not to rummage in the trash cans or the little fake trees they have the airport. I’m suggesting that you shop around. Obviously, there are some fast-food restaurants that have healthy options (Subway, Panera, Au Bon Pain, etc.), and these are your best bet. However, sometimes all that’s there is Fuddruckers or Starbucks. And that means it’s time to get creative. I try to find items that are actually food at different stands and shops&mdash;a package of almonds here, an apple there, a yogurt here, some hummus there. No, that’s not cheap, especially in an airport. But then I’m left without a greasy bag and a stomachache when I need to Please Be Seated with Seatbelts Fastened for the next two and a half hours.</p>
<p>An obvious and final coda to this is that sometimes, it’s ok to indulge. I’m infinitely happier if sometimes I <em>do</em> get that Frosty. Did you know they have child-sized Frosties? It’s not usually on the menu, but it’s enough if I’m really wanting one, but also won’t force me to unbuckle my belt on the plane. Most importantly, the cup is really tiny and cute.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions for healthy options while you’re traveling? What’s better, a Frosty or a McFlurry?</p>
