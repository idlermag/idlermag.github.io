										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the nominations have finally come out and I find myself even further behind than <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">last year</a>. I have seen a total of two of the Best Picture noms, one of the Best Actor, and an impressive ZIPPO of the Best Actress. The supporting categories are even worse. Even cinematography, a favorite category of mine, finds me at a pathetic 1 of 5!</p>
<p>Still, I look forward to this <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">mad dash every year</a>, despite the unnecessary amount of stress I always end up placing on myself.</p>
<p>In the three weeks leading up to the Oscars, I plan to review each film and state its case, culminating in my personal pick for Best Film and my prediction for the actual winner (the twain almost never meet).</p>
<p>I mean seriously, I did this even before I had <em>The Idler</em> as a venue! It&#8217;s a sickness, that&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve knocked out <em>The Tree of Life</em> and <em>The Descendants</em>. Both films are absolutely worthy nominees, but the rest of the category appears to be far more hit or miss. <em>The Artist</em> looks amazing and I hear that that is indeed the case, and I&#8217;ve been pretty excited for <em>Hugo</em> since its announcement. <em>Midnight in Paris</em> looks incredibly charming and Moneyball seems like a pretty solid, sports drama. <em>Warhorse</em>&#8216;s story doesn&#8217;t exactly light my fire, but it sure looks pretty, and that&#8217;s something. The two wild cards are <em>The Help</em> and <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em>. Both carry a definite stigma for me (Oscar Schmaltz), so we shall see.</p>
<p>I look forward to <em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy </em>mostly due to its look (See: elegant), as I hear that it&#8217;s nearly incomprehensible story-wise. I have no doubt that Oldman will be fascinating. I have yet to see <em>Beginners</em>, but I have read the script and it brought me to tears (Because it was good). I needn&#8217;t hear of Oscar nominations to watch anything David Fincher makes, but it&#8217;s a good excuse to get to <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> (If the title sequence doesn&#8217;t pump you up for the flick then I just don&#8217;t know what to tell you!).</p>

<p>At any rate, there&#8217;s a race to run and I am already out of breath!</p>
