										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comic books aren’t great with beginnings and endings, to be honest. As a serialized medium, very few stories have their complete start and finish in a single volume and often rely on a whole host of other stories to make complete sense. When I was a kid, though, nobody I knew really cared if it all made complete sense. The experience of reading a comic was immersive and fantastic and yes, made you want to get more of the same, but not necessarily because anything was missing in the book you just finished. No, I wanted more because every comic built another unique experience on top of what I had just gotten, sort of like a messy stack of bricks. Gaps existed, mortar would gush out around the edges, but I was building my sense of imagination, not some fortress of continuity. If it toppled, no one would get hurt. I could just reuse and rearrange the bricks in a new formation.</p>
<p>The single-issue story definitely helped this process along when I was growing up. There aren’t too many of those today, as readers have gotten older and simultaneously more demanding that every comic be a compelling starting point for new readers, but also continue to reflect everything that has come before it. The done-in-one story (or is it one-and-done? The debate rages.) is largely looked upon as filler, or an interlude, or at worst, a waste &#8212; easily skipped over as the main serial will pick-up its next six to eleven part story next month. I love a great serial, don’t get me wrong. The cliffhangers. The continuing subplots. The ability to look back from the end to see the clues laid months ago at the beginning. These are all awesome aspects of storytelling you can’t get in a single 20 pages &#8212; to the same degree anyway. But as a kid, nothing made me more happy than having a single book I could read again and again and again, and enjoy a little bit differently each time, without having to track down part 3 of 4, or worry about how Superman managed to be here AND in <em>Justice League of America</em> the same month. He just was. </p>
<p>See how easy that is?</p>
<p>I have a few of these books littered throughout my collection. They often are the single issues I see on a rack or in a drawer at a comic shop and just can’t help myself from buying again. Yes, I know I have two copies already &#8212; the ripped up original from when I was 9 and the one adult-me bought to replace it in my “formal collection” &#8212; but this one is near mint, people. And how often am I going to be able to relive that flicker of joy that I got from buying it the first time. If even an infinitesimal spark remains, it’s worth experiencing. I just can’t explain the compulsion any other way. So came across my path <em>Detective Comics</em> #526 the other day.</p>
<p>An extra-sized comic (cover-price $1.50!) from May 1983, this issue was billed largely on the cover as Batman’s 500th appearance in <em>Detective Comics</em>, as the Dark Knight made his intellectual debut in the title’s 27th issue way back in 1939. Not quite a round year anniversary, this story stood out at the time, however, due to its gold ink cover accent and square bound size, not to mention featuring the headshots of pretty much every major Batman villain to date swirling around Batman and his crime-fighting colleagues. Good enough for me. And the cover, pretty cleverly designed from my now-art director’s standpoint as well, lived up to its promise. Upon opening, the reader was treated immediately to a congregation of every major criminal the Bat-family had put away in these 500 issues, and a foreboding title, “All My Enemies Against Me!” Seeing these purveyors of purloinment lined up across a theatre stage was a young reader’s dream, as I could finally have one place to count off and name all the baddies that previously remained scattered throughout my memory and piles of books. </p>

<p>And immediately there was controversy! Talia al Ghul was in love with Batman and wouldn’t go along with the Joker’s plans, no matter how many times she’d tricked the Dark Knight in the past. And Catwoman too had recently moved over to the side of the angels, quickly scooting out on her invite to mistakenly fued with Talia later on. Two ladies vying for Batman’s affections! Even the young homosexual in me was a little bit impressed. Or maybe jealous. And frankly confused. If I were Batman, the choice would clearly be the one wearing the outfit and motif that most closely resembled my own. Catwoman was a no-brainer, Bruce. Let’s be honest.</p>

<p>Batgirl’s arrival on the scene to shake-up a constantly brooding Dick Grayson &#8212; we were long past the golly-gee portion of Robin’s adventures &#8212; was another high-point for me, as the dominoed daredoll was treated with some rare respect in the Batbooks here by prolific writer Gerry Conway. Previously written as having been easily thrown off the trail of the boys’ secret identities, Babs here all but rolled her eyes at Dick’s surprise. She is, after all, a detective. And as the two of them cycled off to track down the parents of young circus trapeze artist Jason Todd (there’s a plot clue in there for the savvy Bat-fan), you could feel that both Robin and Batgirl were not only equals to each other, but growing closer to living up to the example set forth by their mentor himself, the Batman. It was a unique time for all of these characters, long before the family expanded and sons and daughters took turns seeing who could frown the hardest. You feel as if they’re a true family, but one just about to go their separate ways, leaving a significant hole to fill in Batman’s home and methodology.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11210" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/30/one-and-done/oneanddone3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,416" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="OneandDone3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=416" alt="Jason Todd" width="640" height="416" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11210" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=98 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=195 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> </p>
<p>Enter young (red-haired) Jason Todd, who discovers the entrance to the Batcave, finds a spare costume in a dusty old trunk, and stows away inside the Batmobile as Batman, Talia and Catwoman speed away to track down Killer Croc. In the course of events, Jason hears Croc is responsible for the deaths of his parents earlier in the issue, and newly orphaned, flies into action alongside the original orphaned warrior himself. By the end of this issue (Phew! A lot happened here!), you can see Bruce and Jason walking the grounds of Wayne Manor, a new partner in the making just as his previous one is about ready to spread his wings and leave the nest. </p>
<p>Exactly thirty years later, I can recall every panel, every word of this comic like Watchtower bell-ringers know the Bible. I know this book to such a degree that it even begs the question why I needed to buy another (or any) copy. It’s all right up here in my head, and probably will be until the day I die. And it doesn’t much matter that it was Batman’s 500th appearance, or the first time we got to see Jason Todd in costume. It was so many things and none of them. Maybe it was just the time of my life I read it. Or maybe I was just more open to the experience it promised me than I would be today, amid a flush of other books and comics and papers begging for my attention. In any event, I feel blessed to have the memory of such a unique experience and that it remains today as an important one to me.</p>
<p>I have no doubt my time writing for <em>The Idler</em> will remain much like that as well. Before starting my column here, I was a frequent tweeter, sure, but hadn’t been offered the very generous opportunity to share my words with such a distinguished audience, alongside such a brilliant group of authors. It’s an experience that has opened my eyes to things I never thought about, forced me to be prolific, motivated me to expand my skills, and led me to meet and partner with some absolutely amazing people. So, thanks, everyone, for the memories, and may they live on here in perpetuity for us all to revisit and reclaim just a little bit of that spark every time we do.</p>
<p>And for those who want to read more from me, I will be easily found at <a href="http://www.comicosity.com/" target="_blank">Comicosity.com</a>, taking with me the mantra I have since ingrained in my writing (and living) this past year and some months: <em>refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy</em>. May it always be so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s probably pretty clear by now that I’ve read more than my share of comic books. I have about fifteen thousand in my personal collection, curated carefully over the last thirty years, not to mention the thousands more I’ve read and subsequently donated to worthy causes. I still pick up an insane number of new books each month, but can genuinely say I enjoy them all. There doesn’t seem to be much point, after everything I’ve read, to suffer bad stories anymore &#8212; especially when there are always so many good ones to be found on the monthly rack or in the back issue bin. Nonetheless, there is a single comic book that has never quite managed to be topped in my mind and heart, and with good reason. A unique treatise on the power of family, the story “Who is Donna Troy?” still resonates with me after a hundred, possibly two hundred reads, just as strongly as it did the first time I opened its pages.</p>
<p>Originally published in DC Comics’ <em>New Teen Titans</em> #38 in 1984, “Who is Donna Troy?” begins as a curious play on the classic detective story. Dick Grayson, the young man known to the world as Robin, sits in a dark room that feels lifted from every noir film to feature a grizzled sleuth, just waiting for some femme fatale to stroll in the door and turn his life upside-down. Light slides between slits of the window blinds, creating patterns against the hero’s trench coat as he sits down with his coffee to silently review his case files. Dick’s inner monologue is every bit the cliché you expect from a movie detective from the ‘30s or ‘40s, crafting himself as a solitary figure emotionally distanced from those around him. The reality couldn’t be further from the truth, and co-plotters Marv Wolfman and George Perez know it. In actuality, Dick has grown up surrounded by family and friends, first in the spotlight of the circus, then later at Batman’s side and among his peers in the Teen Titans. As a result, Wolfman and Perez beautifully set up this brief façade &#8212; both within Dick’s physical surroundings and own thought process &#8212; to accentuate just how far from hackneyed this tale is going to tread.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10753" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/11/08/sisters-and-brothers-wonder-girls-and-boy-wonders/donna1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg" data-orig-size="640,631" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Donna1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=631" alt="Dick Grayson, private dick" title="Donna1" width="640" height="631" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10753" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=148 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=296 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The key irony to this scene is that Donna Troy has never been a femme fatale, but rather was known for many years (perhaps in great part because of this very story) as the girl everyone wants as a best friend. Kind to a fault, equal parts warrior and compassioned ally, Donna is a super-heroic Mary Tyler Moore, whose only darkness rests in the uncertainty about her own origins. Rescued from a tenement fire as an infant by Wonder Woman, Donna remembered nothing of her past prior to her arrival on the mythic Paradise Island. Raised as Wonder Woman’s sister by her mother Queen Hippolyte, and granted similar powers through technological means, Donna became the teenage heroine Wonder Girl and helped found the Teen Titans with Robin. Since day one, Donna had been committed to the team, coming to regard them as her own adopted family in lieu of any recollection of a birth family. Nevertheless, now coming up on the eve of her wedding, it seems to Wonder Girl more important than ever to know where she came from and who she really is. It’s a tension a lot of adopted children experience as they grow older, but one for Donna that fortunately does not seem alien or hurtful to the family of friends she’s gathered around her. Dick Grayson, an orphan himself, perfectly understands her dilemma, and while he briefly knew and enjoyed a life with his birth parents, Donna’s need for a connection to her past resonates strongly within him.</p>
<p>Donna and Dick’s relationship is one of the most rare in comics, perhaps even pop culture as a whole, in that they are and always have been completely platonic, but deeply connected friends. This dynamic between a heterosexual male and female, particularly in their teens, is far more unusual than one might think. Time and time again, television and books seem to need to address sexual attraction between every male and female lead, but here the writers consistently represent Dick and Donna as solely the closest of friends. Brother and sister in a carefully constructed family, these two are bound not by blood, but by a lifetime of shared adventures and similar loss. It’s a much more difficult dynamic for writers to capture, as it bucks almost every tradition Western culture has tried to maintain regarding heterosexual inevitability, but Wolfman and Perez seem to instill it effortlessly, between these two characters in particular.</p>

<p>While Donna’s desire to know her past may not create familial tension with her groom-to-be or brother-in-arms, her frustration over the process of discovery does reverberate through her relationships. She may not think twice when barreling after the Fearsome Five or throwing a punch at the Terminator, but when confronted by the brick walls of her family history, Wonder Girl may have found her greatest weakness. She does at times project the same misgivings upon Robin, however unwarranted. Ward to the world’s greatest detective, Dick is no slouch when it comes to solving mysteries. That he in fact does so in a single comic book issue is its own meta-reading of Dick Grayson’s expertise, although it also typifies an era when single plotlines were not stretched over six to nine issues of decompressed storytelling. Inevitably, Dick strikes out on his own to find answers on Donna’s behalf, because despite her protests, he knows her heart as well as he knows his own. The family reunions, three to be exact, that Donna is graced with as a result of Dick’s love and dedication (and no small measure of pride), still create the same lump in my throat and tear-filled eyes that I had the first time I read this issue.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10755" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/11/08/sisters-and-brothers-wonder-girls-and-boy-wonders/donna3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna3.jpeg" data-orig-size="640,634" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Donna3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna3.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna3.jpeg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna3.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=634" alt="reunion" title="Donna3" width="640" height="634" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10755" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna3.jpeg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna3.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna3.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=297 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Unquestionably, Perez’s ability to capture facial emotion and body language so eloquently goes a long way toward contributing to my sentimental nature about Donna’s origin story. Every character is distinctively drawn and immediately recognizable in Perez’s <em>New Teen Titans</em> run, not needing to rely on costumes, clothing cues or even hairstyles to adequately differentiate Donna or Dick from other recurring family members or passers-by. Each character is a unique person, as flawed and perfectly individual as those people we know in our day-to-day lives. I frankly can only name a handful of other artists of super-hero comics about which I could say the same, and none of which render their charges nearly as effectively.</p>

<p>But honestly, “Who is Donna Troy?” just isn’t your normal super-hero tale anyway. No punches are thrown. No super-villains show up to move the plot along or introduce witty banter. Indeed, the very fact that Wonder Girl and Robin put on their costumes for any part of this issue seems only in service to the series as a whole; Donna and Dick’s deductive activities certainly don’t necessitate it. What this story excels at doing is removing all the faux action super-hero comics are usually packed with and letting honest motivations and character relationships unveil the dramatic potential of the story instead. While exploding buildings or invading hoards from outer space may often punctuate Donna’s experience of her expanded family, it is more appropriately defined by the smaller moments and revelations between them &#8212; not unlike our own.</p>
<p>As someone lucky enough to have both a strong connection to my family of origin and a constructed family of choice, I get to experience a lot of the joy that Donna sees in her own clan. “Who is Donna Troy?” may ultimately be the most perfect single comic book I’ve read for that reason alone, because it narrows down everything I believe to be true about family &#8212; that ties of friendship are as important as blood, that finding joy is paramount no matter what the odds, and every family deserves the right to define itself by its own best terms. Thanks, Donna and Dick, for being shining reminders of these truths, even all these years later. It’s no wonder I still think of you as one of my best examples for how important best friends and family can be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year into DC&#8217;s reboot of their primary continuity, known as the New 52, <em>Idler</em> comics writer Matt Santori-Griffith and co-editor Gavin Craig are taking stock of some of the high points. This week, at Gavin&#8217;s insistence, they&#8217;re starting things off by talking about <em>Batman</em> and <em>Batman and Robin</em>. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Jumping right in, have you noticed that both books start with Bruce being really sure of himself and his plan of attack (be it investigation into murder or raising a son) and both end the year with him not just realizing his own fallibility, but acknowledging the greater need for the family around him?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I think that making Bruce a bit more vulnerable, a bit more human, has been a really great move since the reboot. Even before the New 52, putting Dick Grayson in the cowl had already given us a Batman who struggled with his limitations, but it&#8217;s a big move to carry that over to Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It&#8217;s certainly part of the larger mission at DC this past year to humanize, not just youthen, its heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> It&#8217;s tempting to treat Batman as a section of the DC universe where not much has changed, but Scott Snyder in particular has shifted a lot of the assumptions that Batman operated under &#8212; even Dick&#8217;s history with the circus wasn&#8217;t what he thought it was.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> But what&#8217;s interesting about that is it&#8217;s not that the readers are getting a retrofitted history. We AND the characters are finding out new facts about the past that NEITHER of us knew before. Batman is as much in the dark as we are. Sure, the timeline is compressed, and minor details have been streamlined (*cough* Red Robin *cough*), but most of the assumptions we have had to date seem to bear out.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> And I think DC has done that pretty well. Compared to the various Crises, which were about streamlining or &#8220;fixing&#8221; continuity, I think the relaunch approach of preserving the core of what works, and shaking up the details has been really successful for storytelling. And the pacing has been magnificent. I remember &#8220;spoiling&#8221; the fact that Snyder was bringing Owlman into continuity in issue #10 of <em>Batman</em>, but that doesn&#8217;t even begin to sum up what Snyder did. It&#8217;s not just about re-introducing a somewhat obscure character, he really re-told Bruce&#8217;s family story (and Alfred&#8217;s) in a way that left everyone a bit shaken. Including me!</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I actually think what Snyder did to Alfred&#8217;s history was even more shocking than what he did to Bruce&#8217;s. In both books, Alfred is incredibly important, but that final story in <em>Batman</em> #11, where we get the truth about Jarvis Pennyworth&#8217;s demise, is so potent and makes Alfred much less of a caricature that he can sometimes become with less careful writers.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yeah, and to bring it back to your point about family, Alfred&#8217;s role as grandfather (of sorts) seems to be really important in both <em>Batman</em> and <em>Batman and Robin</em>. At times he seems to understand Damian Wayne a great deal better than Bruce does. I love the bit where he leaves two trackers on Damian so that Damian will think that he caught Alfred&#8217;s bit of sleight-of-hand.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That was brilliant. Bruce speaks of learning from 6 (not 4) mentors. I wonder if one of them is meant to be Alfred. But honestly, it makes sense that Alfred would understand Damian. He is his father&#8217;s son, and Alfred has already dealt with one hurt, scared 10 year-old Wayne son. Alfred has already done with Bruce exactly what Bruce needs to do with Damian, if Bruce can bring himself to realize it.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>  Coming back to the Court of Owls, the general presumption Bruce makes of his own infallibility isn&#8217;t just a character play (although it&#8217;s certainly interesting enough to be simply that). It also signals exactly how great a departure the New 52 is going to be for Batman moving forward. I feel like it&#8217;s easily been since the early 80s, maybe even the 70s, that we&#8217;ve had a Batman not just willing to admit he&#8217;s wrong, but most of the time, actually wrong. Even at his worst moments, say <em>Tower of Babel</em>, where he betrays all his friends, there&#8217;s still a moral high ground behind his mistake that makes it understandable. Here, though, he&#8217;s just plain wrong. It&#8217;s delightful, really.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I agree that it&#8217;s a great move, and long overdue. A Batman who wins every fight, who already knows everything is fundamentally uninteresting. There&#8217;s really just no way to tell stories about him. A Batman who finds himself having to look at his place in his city in an entirely new way, fighting an enemy who&#8217;d always been under his nose? That&#8217;s fascinating stuff. I love that Bruce actually has to return to the same house where he was trapped as a child to find the Court of Owls. It wasn&#8217;t that he was looking in the wrong place, it&#8217;s that he wasn&#8217;t ready to find them, and they weren&#8217;t ready to be found.</p>
<p>And I also think that Damian Wayne finally carving out his own place in the Bat-family has been really well done. Before the New 52, I wasn&#8217;t a big Damian fan. He just seemed like a bit of wish-fulfillment on Grant Morrison&#8217;s part, a cranky, violent Robin who allowed Morrison to flash-forward to his own take on who Batman should be. I think Tomasi in <em>Batman and Robin</em> has really given Damian room to both be the damaged angry person he is, but also found the insecure, vulnerable child that was always intended to be there, but that a lot of writers didn&#8217;t do a good job of conveying.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I think we saw flashes of that in Morrison&#8217;s <em>Batman and Robin</em>, but it never would have come out in the big brother/little brother dynamic that was Dick and Damian. Damian finally being confronted with having a relationship with his father, and vice versa, is a very distinctive premise upon which to set a book. It&#8217;s truly not Robin&#8217;s book any more than it is Batman&#8217;s. The &#8220;and&#8221; is really the star.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;ve said this before, but one of the things I most appreciate about Damian&#8217;s characterization is that he&#8217;s a ten year old kid who acts like a ten year old kid. Sure, he&#8217;s been trained by the best assassins in the world and has genes that could make Alexander look unambitious, but at his root, he doesn&#8217;t act the way an adult would. I find that very unusual for teen (or tween as the case may be) heroes. I can barely think of any that don&#8217;t just seem like mini-adults.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Indeed! I know you and I don&#8217;t always agree on Tim Drake, and he&#8217;s always been a wildly different character than Damian, in ways both good and bad. I think we&#8217;re starting to get some really interesting tracing of the differences between the various Robins, and Bruce&#8217;s different successes and failures with each.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Absolutely. Tim Drake, for example, is also the one who had a father and wanted a second one, when Damian never even got a chance at one until now. I can see how to a ten-year-old, that might seem greedy. And that&#8217;s what I think so many people who deride Damian are missing. He&#8217;s not a jerk for no reason. He&#8217;s a fucked up little kid with a crazy mother, a grandfather who wanted to steal his body, and a missing dad who dies the minute they meet. Duh.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The art on both titles has also just been outstanding. I really love the way that <em>Batman and Robin</em> gives its artwork space to do a lot of the storytelling. You have some really great or even iconic moments that are just images. I&#8217;m thinking of Damian killing the bat in #2.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Gleason&#8217;s art in <em>Batman and Robin</em> definitely has a more open feel to it than Capullo&#8217;s in <em>Batman</em>, although the latter certainly reflects the tightly wound existence that Bruce lives out.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <em>Batman</em> is SO text-heavy. It almost always works (I think #11 pushes it), but Snyder&#8217;s doing a lot of heavy lifting with the narration and dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> The monologue in <em>Batman</em> is strong. I don&#8217;t mind it so much because the art is crisp and every line just so well chosen. And honestly, I like a book that takes me more than 3 minutes to read. I spend a ton of money every month on these things. Breezing through a stack in 30 minutes is somewhat of a rip-off.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> So, what about Harper Row? Where does she fit in? And what about <em>Batman</em> #12?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <em>Batman</em> #12 is just extraordinary. Art, story, everything.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Here&#8217;s where my head was the day <em>Batman</em> #12 was released: I&#8217;m not sure I can even explain why I&#8217;ve been so especially sensitive to the news lately. It may have started with the midnight shooting at <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. Maybe it&#8217;s just the election cycle, but I&#8217;ve found myself getting tension headaches every time I read another hyper-conservative twist on either gay marriage or civil liberties or the lack of acknowledgement of the role race plays in media reportage. . . whatever. The final straw was the spokesperson for the American Family Association advocating that its members kidnap children from gay parented families in an act of liberty that would mirror the &#8220;Underground Railroad.&#8221; I was so angry and hurt I truly don&#8217;t know how I drove home from work without getting in an accident.</p>
<p>And then I read <em>Batman</em> #12.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, reading a comic where Batman kicks the ass of a bunch of gay bashers. It was moving. Telling the story in DC&#8217;s absolute top-selling book? Made me a little teary-eyed. That it wasn&#8217;t a media event (intended or not) that could be accused of cashing in? Got a little more emotional. But the part that finally made me actually shed tears was the portrayal of a sister so devoted to her brother, and so determined to stand proud for him, that she&#8217;d shave the word FAG in the back of her own head. And then she wanted to help Batman too. If she&#8217;s not a fricking hero already with one single issue, I don&#8217;t know who is.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I know you&#8217;ve done <a href="http://www.comicosity.com/crisis-of-epic-proportion-the-case-of-alan-scott/" target="_blank">some writing about Alan Scott</a> in <em>Earth 2</em> (and you constantly make me feel bad for not reading that title. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what I can give up to increase my comics budget), and there&#8217;s something about having both a headline-grabbing, totally visible mainstream gay character AND having a story like Harper and Cullen Row in <em>Batman</em> #12. <em>USA Today</em> isn&#8217;t going to cover it, but it&#8217;s every bit as visible, and it&#8217;s about the fact that DC does both, not one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That&#8217;s a really good point about their commitment to this area. DC gets a lot of shit for a lot of stuff, and I acknowledge that 30 years of reading them every week has made me into somewhat of an apologist when things go south for them in the PR department. But I can see how hard they&#8217;re trying, especially to reflect gay and lesbian issues in their comics. And it feels like it&#8217;s being handled very differently. I don&#8217;t know if it just seems more organic, but Cullen&#8217;s introduction seems far more natural than Terry Berg&#8217;s in <em>Green Lantern</em> all those years ago. I particularly enjoyed Cullen&#8217;s almost fanboy fawning over Tim Drake (and not even Red Robin in this case). It was cute, and how could that have been in a book 5 years ago?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yes! I became Cullen&#8217;s biggest fan when he started talking about Tim. FINALLY someone understands. I think there&#8217;s a real role for Harper Row to fill, especially if part of Snyder&#8217;s take is that Batman is more estranged from his city than he realizes. She&#8217;s literally on (and under) the ground. And the active Bat-family NEEDS some estrogen. Barbara Gordon and Kate Kane are doing great things, but the Batcave itself is starting to smell a bit like dude.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That&#8217;s an excellent point. I love the idea too that not every hero has to wear a costume in Gotham. And yes, that&#8217;s part of the reason, though, that I am surprised about her overwhelmingly positive fan reaction. I mostly expected the response to be, &#8220;But she&#8217;s not Cass or Stephanie.&#8221; Why do you think she resonated despite that?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Harper didn&#8217;t really make an impression on me until #12 (she really just has a brief cameo or two previously), but I&#8217;m not sure that Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown&#8217;s fan base necessarily overlaps with the general Bat fan base. That is, there are some vocal people who miss Cass and Steph, but there are a whole lot of Bat fans who don&#8217;t. And looking back, even in her cameo, Harper is self-possessed in a way that Steph in particular never was. Steph is a fuck-up who was just starting to find herself in Bryan Q. Miller&#8217;s <em>Batgirl</em> series. Harper has a sort of self-deprecation, but she also used a car battery and jumper cables as a defibrillator. You have to admit, that&#8217;s kind of cool. I love Cass and Steph, but Cass is stunted, and Steph, at her worst, is a loser. Harper is neither, which makes her something of a rarity as a possible female member of the Bat family.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That. Is an excellent way to put that &#8212; self-possessed. She doesn&#8217;t seem to have much self-doubt or self-consciousness, which makes her very attractive to me as a character. Now here&#8217;s a curious question: why do I find Harper so compelling, but other teen characters who act older than their natural age I find unrealistic? Is it because she&#8217;s female?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Well, exactly how old is Harper? She&#8217;s in high school but works for the city electric department</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> She seemed about 16-17 to me.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> She falls a bit into that mini-adult category, but an awesome story covers many flaws.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I find it fascinating that Snyder seems as interested in reincorporating past elements long left behind in the Batman legend as Morrison is.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> It&#8217;s a great move. So much was just left in the dustbin after the mid-1980s.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> And maybe that&#8217;s a good thought to end on. Does the New 52 enable this type of retro-history more than a continuity that seemingly tries to rationalize or retro-remove anything that doesn&#8217;t fit perfectly?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The DC universe is a rather uniquely cobbled-together thing, and <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7029" target="_blank">probably not particularly suited to a totally smooth, consistent history</a> (if such a thing is even possible for mass serial storytelling). I think it&#8217;s not an accident that we&#8217;re not seeing much effort within the new continuity to smooth all the edges. Rather than worrying about continuity in and of itself, it&#8217;s really useful to just free your writers every now and then, and I think that&#8217;s the big thing the New 52 has done.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It&#8217;s certainly paid off for Batman. While historical details may not have changed that much, the tenor of the books in this family has. We&#8217;re not seeing a god-like Batman anymore. Bruce is very much human, even in his most arrogant moments, and that has never been executed as well to date as Snyder and Tomasi are.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Bruce needed some reinvigorating, and even before the New 52, I think that&#8217;s what Morrison in particular tried to do. But Snyder and Tomasi have really pulled the best of what was good, and brought in some great new ideas of their own. I&#8217;m a big Batman fanatic regardless, but he&#8217;s worth reading now as a character with desires and failings. He&#8217;s someone you can tell stories about and not just around. Bruce, after all, is a bit of a jerk, and when you can acknowledge that, then things can really get cooking.</p>
