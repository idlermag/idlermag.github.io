										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps I am of the softball-playing age where I should begin to think of being put out to pasture&mdash;pasture, in this case, being the desolate expanse of the outfield known as right field.</p>
<p>I have been a centerfielder for much of the time since returning to Lansing&#8217;s beer league co-ed rec division post-the birth of my daughter. For the most part, I have enjoyed it&mdash;even reveled in it.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1293" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1293" data-attachment-id="1293" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/10/19/the-hot-corner/bo-jackson/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg" data-orig-size="496,294" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bo-jackson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=496" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300&#038;h=177" alt="Bo Jackson" title="bo-jackson" width="300" height="177" class="size-medium wp-image-1293" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=300&amp;h=177 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg?w=150&amp;h=89 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/bo-jackson.jpg 496w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1293" class="wp-caption-text">Bo knows avascular necrosis.</p></div> Except this year. I&#8217;m bored. Tracking fly balls is less thrilling, and more, well, blah. My focus isn&#8217;t there, and my joints aren&#8217;t a fan of sprinting across uneven, mole-hole filled terrain. Especially this fall, as I&#8217;ve been suffering from what seems to be a hip pointer. (Which is, as I described it to the man in the convenience store, the injury that took Bo Jackson from two-sport pro athlete to retired trivia subject pretty quickly.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for a new challenge. Or looking to recapture the potential I had in my youngest days, when my first fast-pitch coaches would place me at third (which then seemed insulting, as we all wanted to play first) because I had the arm, even then, to make the throw. (Even then, I was tossing the ball with a modified sidearm motion.)</p>
<p>I did play most of one co-ed season&mdash;my first back in action&mdash;at third. That wasn&#8217;t a particularly shining effort, but now I&#8217;m ready to give it the old Little League try all over again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to start training. (Heck, it&#8217;ll also lead to some great blog fodder, right?) Beginning as soon as I find a willing trainer (the Mickey to my Rocky), I am spending the off-season fielding grounders, learning to dive (eek!) and, really, hoping to make myself the most Brandon Inge-like 3B in a skirt in Lansing.</p>
<p>Aside from ordering the Tom Emanski videos, what should I do? Who should be my Mickey? How do I become a great co-ed 3B? What else do I need to do?</p>
<p>Answers, please. This is going to be painful either way&mdash;but perhaps I can augment that with just a little fun.</p>
