										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If someone ever asks you to write for a blog about the things you love, do it. Do it even if writing is already your work and you feel like a failure at it. Do it even if you worry that your opinions will be judged &#8212; that you’ll be deemed too nerdy or not nerdy enough. Do it even if you can’t do anything else; you’ve given up on leaving the couch or brushing your teeth. Do it especially if the urge to nap is your most passionate everyday drive. </p>
<p>When I was asked to write for <em>The Idler</em> I was a mess. I’d spent a lifetime perfecting my identity as head-of-the-class straight-A student only to reach a point in grad school where everything I did was wrong. School wasn’t just school, it was a structure, an armor that kept me safe and all of a sudden it had become unknowable, strange, threatening. Ever an anxious person, my anxieties had begun to overwhelm me and inhibit my functioning. I would will myself to write and nothing would come. I’d sit paralyzed before my screen or notebook too terrified to bother the world with another mistake, a poorly chosen word, a stillborn idea. I developed a phobia of email and phone messages fearing that they, like the endless comments in the marginalia of my work, would tell me something awful. Any negative news could further solidify me in my stuckness, could shock me into a state of literal immobility for days, or even weeks. Writing for <em>The Idler</em> thus offered an attractive distraction. The chance to take up my knowledge of pop culture as a writing subject was a welcome one. With less at stake, my pen began to scribble. A semi-professional television watcher, the prospect of writing about something like the themes of <em>Mad Men</em> loosened up my tic-tacking typing fingers again.</p>
<p>Beyond giving me a space to publically admire the entertainers I love (Maria Bamford, Margaret Cho, Louis C.K.) <em>The Idler</em> allowed me to practice, if in a much smaller way, the brave acts of these folks. I’ve used my bi-weekly column to think through art I’ve seen, movies I’ve watched, but it’s also been extremely important to me to employ this platform as a space of self reflection that helps me sort through, question, and understand what I know and feel and how pop culture aids in these processes. My relationships to fashion, Buffy, working out, media, etc. are mediated by a past thick with stories, and I’ve been so lucky to find a place where I can write my way through these connections. Shaking out readings, reviews, and interpretations through the sieve of my experience is what I do, how I think, and if anything has been heartening in the past few years of idling, it’s been the acceptance, and understanding, and thanks I’ve received for sharing what could easily be read as solipsistic journalings. </p>
<p>What I so desperately and intensely appreciate in the work of my favorite writers and comedians is their ability to reroute our paths to the truth. Sharing pain and shame and fear is powerful and instead of pretending to be above or beyond it, speaking at the level of the shit that brings us down has the incredible power of also rerouting our cultural and emotional responses to what is real and how it is perceived. If I’ve created even one teensy droplet of that magical work, attempted that bravery, or at least sold one person on the possibility that such bravery matters, I am contented and fulfilled. </p>
<p>As <em>The Idler</em> comes to a close, I find myself still struggling with the ghosts of depression and anxiety, but I am so very much stronger now. This writing has helped me. Having writing deadlines at all has been useful, finding feedback that is sweet and thoughtful and caring and supportive has been healing. Reacquainting myself with play, fun, and humor again has been a blast but it’s also helped me remember who I am at my core (a Betty Boop librarian in a Parisian salon full of dogs who read books). </p>
<p>So, I just have to say, thank you for reading, sharing, responding. Thanks for the conversations, with a shout out to Bob Hope, thanks for the memories. You could say all of this idling may have been silly, may have “just” been more blogging out into the sprawling interweb maw of a million voices, may have been a stupid distraction keeping me from more important, professional, or better work, but as a wise dude once said, “yeah, well, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a sojourner in a strange land. I started alone, climbing a sand dune to catch my first glimpse of a mountain with a brilliant light glowing at its peak. As I walked toward the mountain, I encountered a glowing mark which wrapped itself around my neck and gave me the ability to float through the air. I found living scraps of fabric which carried me to a platform where I closed my eyes and saw a figure in white.</p>
<p>That figure would return as I moved forward to show me the story of the world and the people who came before me.</p>
<p>There is a balance every narrative game has to find between what the game gives you, and what it leaves for you to find. My first trip through the game was carried almost entirely by what was given. There was the experience of the world as I traveled through it, and there was the story of the world as revealed in the visions/cutscenes between levels. Every vision showed a little bit of where I had been, a little bit of where I was to go next, and a little bit of what had happened. It&#8217;s brilliantly difficult to be more specific than that, as the visions are images entirely free of text.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on writing. The visions are iconographic &#8212; the graphemes it uses are representations of embodiment and embodied action, and like all representation, it operates by demanding interpretation. The revealed story &#8212; the story communicated through the visions &#8212; is perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous. Life, living cloth, both flora and fauna, emanate from the energy of the mountain. People begin to direct energy, first into greater cloths, and then into structures which use cloths as energy sources. The people attain great heights, and then the energy starts to flicker. There is a tearing of the cloth. New, terrible machines are built under storm and cloud. The world is covered in sand. A single traveler appears, and moves through the ruins of the world to the mountain.</p>
<p>All of this is recorded. All of this is shown. None of it is explained. None of it has meaning independent of the traveler and the player&#8217;s experience. The traveler reconstructs the story by moving to a place in the world where a new chapter can be told. While the story, like all stories, is dependent on an imagined past, the play itself re-creates the story from the very first play. Without the traveler, without the reader, without the player, the writing is just an encoded possibility, a hope for a story. Every book, every game, every story is a ghost, a trace, a breath waiting for a body to enliven.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a companion. I was initially indifferent to others. The game has a trophy given when the player encounters 10 other players within the game. I earned this trophy on my first playthrough, as I moved forward and left other players behind. The second time, however, I met a traveler in a white robe.</p>
<p>Unlike most games with online multiplayer functionality, <em>Journey</em> doesn&#8217;t give players a way to talk to each other using voice or text. Instead, you can press a button to make a noise (which varies in tune with the game&#8217;s soundtrack) and create a single luminescent glyph.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on language. Because you can &#8220;talk&#8221; quietly or loudly by tapping the button lightly or holding it down with greater pressure, the game&#8217;s single hailing action can be incredibly expressive. I soon realized that the other traveler was calling my attention to places in the world I should explore. I found new ruins, hidden flowers, and secret glyphs which added to the story told in the visions. We had a way to acknowledge each other, to keep track of each other, and, most interesting of all, to chatter. Sometimes our speech had a clear purpose &#8212; &#8220;Come over here!&#8221; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; &#8220;Can you see me?&#8221; &#8212; but sometimes it was more a way to share excitement, or nervousness, or wonder. That is, it was a conversation in which clear communication was taking place, but in which that communication was entirely indifferent to individual words. It was a striking reminder of how much of a conversation is carried by tone and context rather than grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>As we moved through the world, the traveler taught me, and I was able to say thank you. In the moments of greatest beauty, we sang to each other. We were not only acknowledging each other, but acknowledging the world, and participating in it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I returned to <em>Journey</em> after my two complete playthroughs for a number of smaller, partial attempts. After the game is completed, the end of the first, tutorial level becomes a gateway where the player can jump to any of the later levels, rather than having to play the whole game in order. I collected the glowing symbols I had missed. I found the final hidden glyphs. I earned a white robe of my own. I tried and failed to take on the role of teacher.</p>
<p>So the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I put the robe away. I gave up the external signs of experience, and simply entered the world again.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on humility. While the story is dependent upon the player as a reader, an actor, a participant, the world itself endures unchanged. In most games, replay value is measured by variability of outcome &#8212; different choices resulting in a different story, different actions leading to a higher score. <em>Journey</em> has no score, and the world, the symbols, the glyphs, the visions, and the outcome are the same every time. You may approach the mountain alone or with a companion, clothed in brown or white, with a long flowing scarf or with almost no scarf at all. The mountain always strips all of these things away. The end is always the same.</p>
<p>And yet <em>Journey</em> is the only video game I can think of which I&#8217;ve played from beginning to end three times.</p>
<p>And the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I met a traveler. Somehow, I was better as a guide in the brown robe instead of the white, and I showed my companion the better paths. As we approached the mountain, in the final wind and snow, we were separated, and I did something I had never done before. I waited. When my companion was blown from the path, I sat in one place so that she could climb back and we could finish the journey together. Even then, somehow, she got ahead of me without my having seen her, and I found myself rising to catch up. I&#8217;m still not sure if I was mistaken somehow about her having lost the path, or if I was inattentive, or if she found a new way. None of these things seems likely, but I know for certain that we were separated and found each other further ahead. My patience, apparently, was nothing compared to my companion&#8217;s, as she waited for me to finish waiting for her. We entered the mountain together, to begin again, alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I saw the world.</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I learned the language.</p>
<p>The third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was part of the world.</p>
<p>I may yet return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I travelled to Chicago to attend a writers’ conference, AWP. AWP is the Association of Writers and Writing Programs. They have a yearly conference in late February where all of the people who belong to AWP, or programs that are associated with AWP, can get together. We attend panels about writing, go to off-site poetry readings, meet online friends face to face, gather information about grad schools, and escape from our real lives for four glorious days.</p>
<p>This year brought home about 10 pounds of journals, two fancy bags, and a head cold that I’m still getting over. I was supposed to bring home new contacts and a connection to an agent. But I panicked.</p>
<p>Last year the conference was in Washington, DC. I went to interesting panels and talked with people in elevators and at the book fair. I even asked a couple questions at the panels. I tweeted and laughed and bonded with complete strangers over the experience of spending four days in a new city discussing writing and literature.  Not so in Chicago.</p>
<p>I rode the train to the Windy City and in the Amtrak station other people were talking about what they would do at the conference. I thought about saying I was going too, but these people were talking to friends and I was a creepy eavesdropper. I stayed mute.</p>
<p>The muteness followed me to Chicago. I wanted to talk to people at the panels. In the more crowded ones we were pretty much on top of each other, with people sitting on the floors at a couple. But all I could think was that the person next to me was taking hardly any notes. This particular panel was about how the panelists, editors at various journals, had changed their writing style after gaining experience editing other people’s work. I took copious notes. The lady to my left wrote down the panelists’ names and then nothing. I wanted to tell her to give her chair to a floor person who would benefit from a comfortable position in which to take notes.</p>
<p>Then the floor people started asking stupid questions and I gave up hope of helping them. They kept asking the speakers to stand up when they were talking so they could be seen. None of the panelists wanted to, you could see it in their eyes. I’m pretty sure one panelist &#8212; I’ll omit names in case I’m reading into things &#8212; rolled her eyes at the people in the front row. Standing was awkward and they had to pass around one mic instead of using the convenient tabletop mics the hotel had provided. I was irritated and I knew I was being a bit irrational but that rarely stops me.</p>
<p>In DC I made arrangements to have lunch with fellow Idler Jill Kolongowski a few days before I left. We knew each other from college and I wanted to see her again to kind of cement our quasi-friendship. We met, hugged, and ate Italian food. Her gnocchi looked amazing but I didn’t know her well enough to ask for a bite. This year, after growing closer online, I didn’t set up a time to meet with her at all. We happened to run into each other at the book fair after I spent days thinking I should have tried to find her but not doing anything about it. I was broken.</p>
<p>And I was hating people. There was the lady sitting next to me at a very not crowded panel who kept looking over my shoulder and writing down something every time I wrote down something. There were multiple panels where there weren’t enough handouts to go around. Generally, I’m an excellent note taker and prefer to write down what I’m interested in as opposed to having someone tell me what’s most important. But when there were handouts and they ran out, suddenly I wanted one. I needed one! Now there would be hard to spell author last names and bullet points and a bevy of information I wouldn’t be able to access just because someone miscalculated the popularity of learning the best ways to introduce the element of surprise in short stories. I had seen a gentleman in my “Beyond Pulp – The Futuristic and Fantastic as Literary Fiction” get up and chase down the handout he wanted. I was <em>not</em> going to be that guy. Heaven forbid I embarrass myself in front of a room of people I’d never see again.</p>
<p>At one panel the two women in front of me struck up a conversation and ended up sharing email addresses and Twitter names before the panel even started. I wondered what they were talking about. I think I heard mention of <em>Sherlock</em> and wanted to join in, but didn’t. How do you just turn to a stranger and find out something you have in common? I texted this question to my friend back home because obviously the best way to make contacts at a conference is to have your nose in your cell phone.</p>
<p>One lady was knitting during the panel I was excited about the most. Knitting. She was already there when I found my seat; I got in as soon as the room cleared. I assumed she had attended the previous panel and was just killing time before the next one started. But she didn’t stop knitting when they started talking. She was all “knit, purl, knit, purl” oblivious to her surroundings. The five young women on the panel had put time and effort into research about how to make money while writing and this person was crafting during their talk. Halfway through she seemed to remember where she was and packed up her needles. Instead of politely listening she got up and walked out.</p>
<p>By the end of the week I was exhausted. I wandered aimlessly through the book fair, tried to talk to the people manning the booths but my sentences weren’t coming out as planned. I left early due to overstimulation and hid in my hotel room.</p>
<p>Why was my Chicago experience so different from DC? I know not everyone judges me as harshly as I judge them. I know I can talk to strangers and come out the other end unscathed. And I know I’m not the only one with these worries. I definitely wasn’t the only one glaring at the knitting lady or laughing silently at the guy chasing down a silly handout. Many of the attendees are like me, quiet in large groups, expressing themselves through blogging instead of talking, planning out exactly what to say in any situation that could possibly arise at a 10,000 person conference.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees pushed through these worries and got stuff done anyway. They tweeted that they were wearing purple zebra print tights and to say hello if you saw them at the book fair. They bonded over walking twelve blocks through wind and snow. Most of us let go of our fears and said hello to an author whose books are well worn on our shelves back home. A writing conference may seem a little ironic since we are often loners, but we love each other. We get each other. And even if one of us is broken and walking alone down the street, another writer will strike up a conversation and give a girl like me great advice on how to write a short story.</p>

<em>(Origin: Middle English; Empty, trifling, vain, useless)</em></p>
<p>Circle ‘round August to August, last year to now and you might think that nothing has come of me, nothing has changed.  But you’d be wrong.</p>
<p>I have not graduated, finished a dissertation let alone defended one.  Look at me and you won’t see progress, just idle hands.</p>
<p>You see, my engagement with the texts in my discipline (English) is a little “too.”  Too personal, too creative.  When I work, I’m to think critically and I do, but then I get bored and I wander and I play.  I tell myself jokes; I tilt words and ideas against each other.  I write love letters to my novels and hold hands with their pages.  This doesn’t look like academic writing.  This doesn’t look like a dissertation.  I am All But Dissertation.</p>
<p>I try to change, I force it and will it and rip myself out of each draft because Me and I are selfish, narcissistic, egotistical and the academy is a humble and rational place.  Then, it doesn’t sound right or read right and I am further away from finishing than when I started.</p>
<p>Gavin Craig says, “Hey, girl!  Come write for The Idler.  It’s a place I’m building where we can talk about things that are fun, activities that are too creative, too mindless, too enjoyable.”  And I say okay.  Biweekly I compose a page or two about the things that I know (fashion and television, crafting and dog-mom-ing).  I share all these nothings that are all but dissertation.</p>
<p>Still.  I’ve been sick or stuck or both for a long time.  I probably could have written two dissertations in the time that it’s taken me to anxiously wallow through day after day of not writing one.  Every day when I begin, when I heave myself to the blank page or somebody else’s written one, it’s a struggle.  Each word I read is overshadowed by the thousands I haven’t.  Each phrase I commit to the screen reminds me of chapters unwritten.  Daily, I am a dot adrift in a sea of failure.  Whenever I attempt to situate myself, navigate these bitter waters, take charge of my life, my destiny, or please God, even just a paragraph, I do so always with an anchor firmly tethered round my waist.</p>
<p>A few years ago &#8212; yes, I’ve lost years &#8212; I imagined an &#8220;out&#8221; of sorts.  A fluffy marshmallow dream in which I get hit by a car.  But, I wasn’t suicidal &#8212; no, that’s way too hardcore for the likes of me.  Noooo.</p>
<p>I just wanted to be injured, maybe maimed. </p>
<p>Something that would make me bleed, crack a bone or two and swell my body into a plump bruise.  A black eye would be a nice touch.  Then, you see, people would feel sorry for me.  Clearly, the dissertation clock could stop ticking for a spell.  I would have the time to heal my invisible wounds while the “real” visible ones, the kind people care about, got better.  I would make up lost time on my work while my body recovered and everything would be fine.  Viola!</p>
<p>This little fantasy would float in and out of my consciousness every now and then, but it’s lost all its magical power since my friend and fellow grad student really got hit by a car.  She’s okay, but the thought of losing her to something so stupid, and something I’ve designed in semi-comic/semi realistic detail in my head. . . it makes me want to retch.</p>
<p>And still I go on being stilted.  No progress to be seen.</p>
<p>I take in a lot of fluff.  I am a pop culture queen,</p>
<p>a goddess of nothing.</p>
<p><em>The Idler</em> collects my columns, shrines to inaction.  My computer file folders are once again filled with documents.  Not the right ones, but still. . .</p>
<blockquote><p>I write these stupid words<br />
And I love every one<br />
Waiting there for me.<br />
Yes I do, I do.<br />
&#8220;In the Garage,&#8221; Weezer</p></blockquote>
<p>I watch <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>.  TV reminds me that even super surgeon Christina Yang needs time.  She leaves surgery, she bartends, she decorates the apartment.  She comes back when she’s good and ready.  Shonda Rhimes helps me remember that trauma doesn’t care about your deadlines. You gotta work through your shit, she says.  Toni Morrison tells me something similar in <em>Song of Soloman</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>You wanna fly?  You gotta give up the shit that wears you down.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this quote is attached to another silent truth.  The giving up takes time.  It takes work.  It even requires moments, stretches of idleness.</p>
<p><strong>Idle</strong>&#8212;<br />
<em>(Origin: the verb sense of &#8220;running slowly and steadily without transmitting power&#8221; (as a motor) first recorded 1916.)</em></p>
