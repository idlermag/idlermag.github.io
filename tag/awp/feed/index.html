										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m from Las Cruces, New Mexico, a city populated by around 99,000 people where you can somehow still run into everyone you know at the Super Walmart on Valley Drive and Avenida de Mesilla. It’s the kind of place where high school sports rivalries are king, where teenagers huddle down into a dusty ditch bank and drink watered down beer while fields of cotton grow dry and wooly and the sun bakes the ground into a crack-fissured clay. The weather forecast forms a bingo board of little yellow sunshines, disturbed every once in a good while by thunderous storms that pour in fresh wet stripes punctuated with whipcrack flashes of lightning. </p>
<p>People there talk in funny accents &#8212; a marriage of cool, laid-back, Californian English and dramatically elongated Spanish syllables. One “gets down” from the car to go into the store, and carries the onus of a silly nickname like a mythological birthright. The food is fat with flavor, the culture, thick with artists. Stay long enough and a slow and sleepy boredom seeps deep into your bones, not a boredom that irritates so much as builds a gravity that keeps you in one place, makes you stay &#8212; warm, dream-heavy, happy. When choosing a grad school, I picked faraway places on the map fearing the lotus-eater lull of my beautiful home and an almost genetic tendency toward petrified paralysis. I’ve been working through the cold perspective of living in East Lansing, Michigan for about 10 years, now.</p>
<p>I’d never been to Boston, Massachusetts until a few weeks ago. Everything I knew of the place was a small collage of colonial history, Celtics basketball, the regulars of the downstairs bar, <em>Cheers</em>, and some dramatic scenes from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. (“I gawt huh numbuh&#8211;how bout them ah-pples?”) Representing the non-fiction journal I work for at MSU, I attended a conference for the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) in a complex hamster cage of a hotel conference center/shopping mall in downtown Boston. Imagine thousands of writers anxiously milling about in their scarves and wryly chosen spectacles. Aisle after aisle of booths, books, authors, publishers, editors. In some ways I felt completely at home. Not geographically, per se, but in my seat of comfort and power; I was in a place where my love for literature and language could find friendship and revel in nerdy delights. In other ways I felt completely lost and alienated. Amidst the movement, the clouds of chatter, the thousands of people just like me, I could at times feel dull, null, nil. </p>
<p>The snow outside was falling sideways in wet messy sheets. The streets were puddled with thick ice water ponds much deeper than my sneakered toe could dip. Inside, the conference hummed with body heat and dizzying distraction, the intermingling exhalations of too many mouths.</p>
<p>Making my way through the labyrinthine levels and turns, past the conference center, the Starbucks, the Coach store, beyond the reach of Armani, Louis Vuitton, the kiosks at the mall, down the escalator and across a hidden underpass below the exposed snowy street above, I bought a ticket on the train and booked it to Harvard. Nervous and alone I watched the stops on the map too closely. I focused tightly on the colored lines, the dots for each station, as Boston people populated and detrained the car with an easy indifference.</p>
<p>After trudging through slick muck in Harvard Square for at least twenty minutes, I was cold, lost, and spent, but I found the tattoo shop, finally. My friend’s brother, Sky, was my artist. He’s from my hometown, but I’d never met him. And here we were, together, two desert kids in Massachusetts telling stories of sun, Spanish art, the power of tamales and cholo style. And he was quiet, funny, smart, thoughtful, with a tiny Zia symbol etched behind his ear. A teacher, a maker, an avid Netflixer, much like myself. And he carved a red heart into my forearm, needled in colors of New Mexico sunsets onto the banner, marked my love of TV (with equal parts wink and sincerity) into the geography of my body. When the pain burned hotter and my eyes would roll back away from the whirring, Dia de los Muertos and retablo inspired pieces settled my gaze. We talked about loving a place, our home, and how we could never really go back. Our stories overlapping with the colors he was stitching. Intersecting lines and routes. Mappings. Intersecting lines and roots. </p>
<p>No longer lost, I made my way back to the dirty subway platform, still concrete and grey, still alien, but a little less scary, a little more known. Cold, tired, surrounded by strangers, I carried my new gift home. My heart throbbing in my coat sleeve, hidden, secret, and mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I travelled to Chicago to attend a writers’ conference, AWP. AWP is the Association of Writers and Writing Programs. They have a yearly conference in late February where all of the people who belong to AWP, or programs that are associated with AWP, can get together. We attend panels about writing, go to off-site poetry readings, meet online friends face to face, gather information about grad schools, and escape from our real lives for four glorious days.</p>
<p>This year brought home about 10 pounds of journals, two fancy bags, and a head cold that I’m still getting over. I was supposed to bring home new contacts and a connection to an agent. But I panicked.</p>
<p>Last year the conference was in Washington, DC. I went to interesting panels and talked with people in elevators and at the book fair. I even asked a couple questions at the panels. I tweeted and laughed and bonded with complete strangers over the experience of spending four days in a new city discussing writing and literature.  Not so in Chicago.</p>
<p>I rode the train to the Windy City and in the Amtrak station other people were talking about what they would do at the conference. I thought about saying I was going too, but these people were talking to friends and I was a creepy eavesdropper. I stayed mute.</p>
<p>The muteness followed me to Chicago. I wanted to talk to people at the panels. In the more crowded ones we were pretty much on top of each other, with people sitting on the floors at a couple. But all I could think was that the person next to me was taking hardly any notes. This particular panel was about how the panelists, editors at various journals, had changed their writing style after gaining experience editing other people’s work. I took copious notes. The lady to my left wrote down the panelists’ names and then nothing. I wanted to tell her to give her chair to a floor person who would benefit from a comfortable position in which to take notes.</p>
<p>Then the floor people started asking stupid questions and I gave up hope of helping them. They kept asking the speakers to stand up when they were talking so they could be seen. None of the panelists wanted to, you could see it in their eyes. I’m pretty sure one panelist &#8212; I’ll omit names in case I’m reading into things &#8212; rolled her eyes at the people in the front row. Standing was awkward and they had to pass around one mic instead of using the convenient tabletop mics the hotel had provided. I was irritated and I knew I was being a bit irrational but that rarely stops me.</p>
<p>In DC I made arrangements to have lunch with fellow Idler Jill Kolongowski a few days before I left. We knew each other from college and I wanted to see her again to kind of cement our quasi-friendship. We met, hugged, and ate Italian food. Her gnocchi looked amazing but I didn’t know her well enough to ask for a bite. This year, after growing closer online, I didn’t set up a time to meet with her at all. We happened to run into each other at the book fair after I spent days thinking I should have tried to find her but not doing anything about it. I was broken.</p>
<p>And I was hating people. There was the lady sitting next to me at a very not crowded panel who kept looking over my shoulder and writing down something every time I wrote down something. There were multiple panels where there weren’t enough handouts to go around. Generally, I’m an excellent note taker and prefer to write down what I’m interested in as opposed to having someone tell me what’s most important. But when there were handouts and they ran out, suddenly I wanted one. I needed one! Now there would be hard to spell author last names and bullet points and a bevy of information I wouldn’t be able to access just because someone miscalculated the popularity of learning the best ways to introduce the element of surprise in short stories. I had seen a gentleman in my “Beyond Pulp – The Futuristic and Fantastic as Literary Fiction” get up and chase down the handout he wanted. I was <em>not</em> going to be that guy. Heaven forbid I embarrass myself in front of a room of people I’d never see again.</p>
<p>At one panel the two women in front of me struck up a conversation and ended up sharing email addresses and Twitter names before the panel even started. I wondered what they were talking about. I think I heard mention of <em>Sherlock</em> and wanted to join in, but didn’t. How do you just turn to a stranger and find out something you have in common? I texted this question to my friend back home because obviously the best way to make contacts at a conference is to have your nose in your cell phone.</p>
<p>One lady was knitting during the panel I was excited about the most. Knitting. She was already there when I found my seat; I got in as soon as the room cleared. I assumed she had attended the previous panel and was just killing time before the next one started. But she didn’t stop knitting when they started talking. She was all “knit, purl, knit, purl” oblivious to her surroundings. The five young women on the panel had put time and effort into research about how to make money while writing and this person was crafting during their talk. Halfway through she seemed to remember where she was and packed up her needles. Instead of politely listening she got up and walked out.</p>
<p>By the end of the week I was exhausted. I wandered aimlessly through the book fair, tried to talk to the people manning the booths but my sentences weren’t coming out as planned. I left early due to overstimulation and hid in my hotel room.</p>
<p>Why was my Chicago experience so different from DC? I know not everyone judges me as harshly as I judge them. I know I can talk to strangers and come out the other end unscathed. And I know I’m not the only one with these worries. I definitely wasn’t the only one glaring at the knitting lady or laughing silently at the guy chasing down a silly handout. Many of the attendees are like me, quiet in large groups, expressing themselves through blogging instead of talking, planning out exactly what to say in any situation that could possibly arise at a 10,000 person conference.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees pushed through these worries and got stuff done anyway. They tweeted that they were wearing purple zebra print tights and to say hello if you saw them at the book fair. They bonded over walking twelve blocks through wind and snow. Most of us let go of our fears and said hello to an author whose books are well worn on our shelves back home. A writing conference may seem a little ironic since we are often loners, but we love each other. We get each other. And even if one of us is broken and walking alone down the street, another writer will strike up a conversation and give a girl like me great advice on how to write a short story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I’m flying to the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) Conference in Chicago (a conference for writers, teachers, and book nerds of all varieties). It’s the first year I don’t have to sit at a table and force flyers into writers’ unwilling hands or present a paper that I’m only 20% sure is legitimate. I’m free to carry a flask (even if I fill it with water and only pretend it’s gin), wake up whenever I want, and be only marginally cooperative. I’m going to AWP to see old friends, meet people in real life that I’ve only ever met on the internet, maybe go to some panels and readings, and schmooze. Well, in my head I’m schmoozing; in reality I’m standing in the corner staring at someone important while I try to get the courage to go up and talk to him, and he walks away before I can make up my mind. I will not be eating.</p>
<p>Normally, eating is the highest of my priorities. Sometimes it’s even above getting dressed properly. I always eat three meals a day. If I don’t, my sugar level crashes and I become a monster whose superpower is whining and complaining about migraines, intent only on eating but also unable to decide what she wants or how to get it. My days are planned so that this monster stays penned up in her cage. But at AWP, it’s feast or famine. All my normal eating habits go straight out the window. I eat like a 10-year-old child left without a babysitter. My brain is too scrambled from the simultaneous presence of great writers and fear of looking like an idiot.</p>

Even though I made sure my face looks good, I keep head down to avoid eye contact. Pretend like I’m not a tourist like the twenty other conference-goers in line. I order a bagel. They are out of all but onion bagels. I order an oatmeal. They will somehow forget my order and I have to order again. Now I’m starting to run out of time to make it to the first panel. On the way out the door, I realize I’ve made no plan where to actually <em>eat</em> the oatmeal. I try to eat it while I walk, but the steam from the oatmeal fogs up my glasses and I can’t see. I drop the spoon on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Once I’m in the conference hotel, I sit in a corner behind a stray table and bend the oatmeal lid to use as a spoon. I hope no one can see me but of course someone I know will come up to say hello. I’ll have to hoist myself up from the ground to hug her. I will get oatmeal on her coat. I vow to get a portable breakfast sandwich tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I hurry to the first panel and sit down in a seat at the end of one of the rows, unwinding multiple scarves and trying not to breathe too loudly. Sitting at the end of an empty row means everyone has to step over me. But I will not yield because the hurry and the oatmeal have made me sweaty, and it’s best if I keep as far away from everyone as possible.</p>

Or not.</p></div> Once the panel is finished, I realize that, even though I’m not hungry, this will be my only chance to eat until dinner. I’d Yelped a cute lunch place nearby but there’s no time for that, so I duck my head and make a beeline for Subway. Half the conference had the same idea. We cram in next to the plastic tables and try not to graze elbows (unless the writer next to me is famous, in which case I WILL try to graze elbows). Everyone is fumbling with their conference badges and standing on their tiptoes to glare at the cashier, as if that will make the line go faster. I give up and leave. I bought my ticket to AWP and I WILL NOT spend it in a Subway.</p>
<p>While I climb the stairs to the next panel, I remember the peanuts. Every time I fly, I ask for peanuts and only eat one of the two little bags. It seems silly to throw it away, so I save the extra bag in my purse for some indeterminate time. I realize that NOW IS THAT TIME. Outside the conference room, I pour two salty bags of peanuts into my mouth so that the crinkly package doesn’t annoy everyone during the talk. I wash it down with a paper cup of free coffee.</p>
<p>By the time I’m supposed to meet up with my friends for dinner, I’m jittery and my blood sugar is so low I want to buy one of those $8 sandwiches they were selling in the lobby that were more bread than anything else. I know I’m on my way to dinner but I’m concerned I legitimately might not make it. When I get to the lobby, the caterers have gone home to their own dinners. I go back upstairs and walk from conference room to conference room, peeking in each until I find the leftovers from some reception or another. I dart in and grab a sad-looking smashed half of a brownie. To assuage my guilt and shame, I take one of their pamphlets. I never read it.</p>
<p>I meet my friends for dinner and we order all the courses, even though they make you pay extra for salad and bread. We order overpriced bottles of wine. We imagine ourselves a night full of telling stories with strangers, pretending we’ve read books we haven’t, and remembering why writing matters. Instead we are so full we end up in our beds early. I write myself a reminder to get a sandwich in the morning. I lose the note and fall asleep.</p>
<p>By the time I get home I’ll be craving fresh fruit like someone with scurvy. I’ll lay on the couch and eat apples and vow to eat like a normal human being next year. By next year I’ll forget, but I keep collecting extra bags of airplane peanuts.</p>
