										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been an athlete. The only marathons I’ve ever been interested in are the kinds about special victim units, crime scene investigations, or drag queen reality shows. In elementary school, I hid behind the giant shady tree to avoid my turn at bat on the baseball diamond. In soccer, I’d run around and try to escape the ball and the action. In high school P.E., the volleyball girls would yell at me and sigh their hissy sighs because I’d cost us all the points. If I had to do any kind of racing, I just picked the shortest distance possible so I could get coming in last over with as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>My mom’s side of the family is full of athletes; they keep themselves busy with sports of all kinds, but of all the meets, games, and matches of theirs I’d observe, running seemed to be the most attractive to me. Maybe it’s because there’s no team or rules or sets of special skills I could mess up. Maybe it’s because it offered a way of being athletic <em>sans</em> the threat of being hit by any kind of ball, but running seemed like something I could maybe, possibly figure out how to do. </p>
<p>During middle school and high school summers off, I’d watch my aunt with her giant muscled calves, circling the track, ponytail bobbing. I’d go with her to her workouts, walk the same circle and another nearby dirt path ad nauseum. Sometimes my cousin would join us. We’d all arrive in the same car, stretch at the same time, but they’d go one direction and I’d go another. I’d wonder what they talked about, double ponytails bobbing, and I’d feel really lonely, soft, round, and slow. And all the endless walking never seemed enough, never shaped my calves into angled mounds, never made me the kind of girl who had the kind of juicy problems worthy of puzzling through on a long run with an adult. Walking could be calming, could provide a pleasant admixture of thought and movement that would cushion introspection or spin out the wordy tendrils of a poem or story, and it was freeing, but in comparison to the running, the runners, it felt pathetic. </p>
<p>Yet, a few weeks ago, I ran a half marathon. I’m still not sure how that happened. I know I joined a running team, found a Saturday running partner. I know I put in the time and the grumbling and the pain and the doubt. Did I cry and/or beat myself up when I had a bad run? Yup. Often, it felt like such a ridiculous trick I was playing on myself &#8212; who was I fooling trying to outrun myself? My identity as fat smart kid seems so. . . inescapable. Anything else is beyond my comprehension. I don’t get how people feel strong and capable, how they throw their arms up in victory, feel like powerful monsters that pad around in sneakers and tear up the road. After my race I knew I wanted to feel confident and proud; it was amazing to hear praise about what I’d accomplished. But my feelings haven’t caught up with my mind. I understand that I did an amazing thing, that my body pushed through the shit of my past, proved stronger than I ever imagined it could be, but the mantle of the runner still fits awkward on my frame.</p>
<p>Early in the race a train halted any progress forward. Everyone around me was pissed (or pissing), I was enjoying an impromptu parade in my brain &#8212; a rousing rendition of some Souza tune for this free break in the drudgery. But, then looking around me, there was that familiar lonesome hollow in my gut. These people were competitors, and thus somehow more “real” than I was. Though I wished that I had hopped the train like a hobo of olden days, I kept going, pounded bruises into my toenails, popped bloody blisters while climbing hills. My partner and I spotted dogs, discussed their fluff, or butts, or faces. No ponytails, but our thick calves did flex in rhythm. </p>
<p>At the end of the race I broke down. Had to stop, had to breathe and uncoil a knot in my belly. I let my partner go on and I freaked out for a good minute. Ghosts rushed through me, all the thoughts that hurt. “Here you go, getting so close and collapsing. You can’t finish anything. See? You don’t belong here. See? You’re all alone.” And I kept going, feeling like I’d already lost but needing to save face. That last bit felt stupid and awful and dumb and stupid again and just when I was about to walk a bit more, some man I don’t even know told me NO. “You will not stop,” he said, “you can run with me and we’ll do this together.” Except I couldn’t hear a damn thing he was saying but somehow that was communicated. There was wind in my ears, but he was guiding me through the whole ending, what was left and how to do it. It didn’t matter that the words never landed, it was just so good, so incredibly good, to not be alone, to lift out of that sports + me = alienation equation for long enough to cross the finish line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sun is shining, birds are chirping, yes, even here in Michigan.  And because this is Michigan, the desire to break out of the house and leap into spring at a full gallop is strong.  And because I’m from New Mexico the desire to be out in the sunshine is even stronger.  And so I run &#8212; even though I hate running. </p>
<p>Beyond the difficulty of body &#8212; joints pounding, feet aching &#8212; I think the real pains of running for me are those inflicted and remembered by my mind. </p>
<p>I have/had eating disorders. Anorexia, chronic overeating, exercise bulimia. The temporality around “have” and “had” is fraught because there is no “all better” or “completely cured” with these illnesses. Even at my healthiest, the sick and self-defeating thoughts, the obsessions, and the self-hatred remain coiled and ready to attack at the slightest prodding or trigger.  A beautiful piece of frosted cake.  The mention of “bikini season.”</p>
<p>At my worst with anorexia, I was in high school and I would will my body awake at 5 a.m. to pound the pavement of my quiet neighborhood. I forced myself to run, not because I sought health or muscles or freedom, but because it expended calories and it had to do so faster than my endless wandering walking.  This “running” was slow and labored, my disease took the form of an apparition that would drag me forward by a fistful of my too-big t-shirt.  Belly empty, brain full of haze and stars, I was not only running on no breakfast, but the fumes of energy left over from the previous day’s diet.  </p>
<ul>
<li>milk, maybe cereal</li>
<li>skip lunch, pocket lunch money for weekend movies</li>
<li>1 can of low-cal soup for dinner</li>
<li>make sad sandwiches, hide them in dresser drawer to trick family, attract ants, change plan, flush food down the toilet</li>
<li>diet soda forever</li>
<li>low fat yogurt for dessert</li>
<li>perhaps some crackers for snacks, make sure to count them out, nibble them down, make them last</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to keep my daily calorie intake somewhere around 600 calories or less.  I’m sure I was much more precise then, however.  Anorexia is very much a numbers game, a running tally of intake and expenditures.  How many minutes did I run?  How many steps?  How many more can I stand before dying? </p>
<p>So, I’d run before school and sometimes again after school got out, but this second go round had to happen at the high school track so it wouldn’t look excessive to my family when I then popped an exhausted Denise Austin aerobics tape into the VCR and shuffled my zombie body back and forth across the living room carpet.  </p>
<p>At first, this routine was hard. Hunger screams and yelps and whimpers, howls through you.  But eventually you think you beat the system, that you’ve deprogrammed the feelings of starvation.  The hunger dissipates into a dull nothing and you float around on your imagined lightness, the concavity of your belly, and you take incredible pride (overweening, tragic flaw, will cause your downfall kind of pride) in conquering your body.  You’ve overcome human desire.  You are a GOLDEN GOD.  But a golden god can’t hang out with friends at a pizza parlour without worry, or pay attention to just about anything.  Golden Gods become golden by counting and numbering, dividing and multiplying.  There is no actual joy,  just a few rushes now and then borne of the power to deny and punish and hurt yourself and take it because, clearly, you deserve it.  </p>
<p>Your hair falls out in clumps in your shampooed hand. Your period stops. </p>
<p>The world falls away.  </p>
<p>When running, there is no release, rather an intense hanging on to what it means, could mean in terms of reduction.  Is the calorie expended yet?  Has it burned away?  When will I feel it, see it?  How long until I weigh myself again?  How much further can I push that little needle?</p>
<p>Last week, ten plus years after my worst bout with my body, I had a panic attack.  My Facebook feed is full of beautiful runners.  Real runners, runners who traipse through 5Ks before breakfast, Runners who rely on nutritious calorie-filled goos to power themselves through extensive training and amazing distances.  Athletes. Usually I am amazed by these people, motivated by them, or just so completely aware that I am not one of their ilk that I don’t even try to compare myself, but this past week, something tweaked and I saw these statuses of achievement and I lost it.  </p>
<p>My heart sank, my body (in my mind’s eye) grew about four sizes, my physical flaws magnified.  My skin prickled &#8212; it was so disgusted to be associated with me.  10 pm and I was 2 seconds from lacing up my sneakers and flying out the door. I was going to pound that pavement just like I used to, just ‘til it hurt and then a little longer, a little further.  Just ‘til I felt like retching and then maybe go some more.  I was gonna run into forever and not stop until i crumpled into a ball like the unfortunate possum or squirrel that dreamed too big, couldn’t make it across the street.  </p>
<p>Sweat is fat crying.  No pain, No gain. At least that’s what “motivational” pictures on the internet tell me.  </p>
<p>But then I didn’t lace my shoes.  I didn’t eat everything in the cupboard either (overeating is the other way I “deal” with stress and anxiety).  Instead I painted a picture.  Poured my nervous energy into fluorescent pinks and purples on a naked canvas.  This time, the running and eating, they waited.  I like to think it’s because I’m trying, really working and trying, to make them mine in a pleasurable way.  The beginning of my love story (a love of running, food, and self) first requires the elimination of punishment from my calculation of self worth.</p>
<p>I’m running, even if I don’t like it very much now, to find out if maybe I can peel back the memories of sacrifice and belittling, of the drudgery of each footfall, of the movement in circles around my neighborhood serving as a consequence of my failure to be perfect.  I’m hoping that underneath all those stories, I’ll break through to some place where I feel okay with my limitations, where running is a thing I can do, and not a thing I have to do. Though the wicked little calorie fears still linger, I’m pushing to find release.  Pleasure in the inhalation and exhalation of breath.  Power in the ability to move with speed while lapping up the sunshine like some Edenic creature.  I know I probably won’t get there fully, but I’m practicing getting closer.  I’m already really amazing at hating myself, pushing too hard, denying myself. Now, more than anything I’m practicing finding what feels good when I run.  It might not make the best internet meme, but I’m aiming for a less pain, some gain.  Revising the motto: Just Do It, but if it hurts, it’s okay to stop.  It’s okay to stop.</p>
