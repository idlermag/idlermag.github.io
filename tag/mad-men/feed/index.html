										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday’s episode of <em>Mad Men</em>, “The Crash,” was packed with break ups, break ins, and breakdowns. Framed by the volatile relationship between the ad company and the Chevy account, the episode examines how things fall apart, both in and out of the office, through the tropes of collision, danger, safety and care. Herky-jerky and oddly paced, “The Crash” quite purposefully suffers from an irregular heartbeat that drives the viewer quickly forward, while also maintaining an unsettling sense of disquiet on the verge of nausea. We’re meant to feel feverish, sick. We’re meant to follow the fall of Don Draper and vicariously experience the thrill and horror of that flight/fall.</p>
<p>The office (newly merged with a business rival), Don (desperate to win Sylvia back), and the country (steadily losing troops in Vietnam) are all slipping and sliding, trying to stand on shaky ground. Beginning with a bang, the show opens with a scene of reckless driving and an automobile crash. Ken Cosgrove fearfully tries to control the wheel but the raucously drunk Chevy clients laugh and swat at him, brandish a gun, cover his eyes. The men question his masculinity because he won’t speed up, and eventually they overpower him, coaxing the car head-on into danger. When we next see Ken he’s injured and hobbling on crutches. He seeks sympathy but his co-workers don’t seem to care. </p>
<p>There’s a ton going on in this episode, but I was most interested in the issues of health and sickness and what it means to be a man. The show’s made an icon of Don Draper &#8212; he’s heralded as a mysterious lothario, a sixties “pimp,” and people, men, seem to find him admirable for this. Yet, lately, he’s off his game. His moments of Draper ad magic are coming with less frequency, less pop, and his love-’em-and-leave-’em sex magic seems pretty dried up, too, since he’s become needy, even frightening, in his desire for Sylvia. “The Crash” could be read as his coming down from a Sylvia high &#8212; the doctor’s wife acting as his anodyne, his distracting drug. Though we’ve seen Draper use sex as medicine before, something is different about this particular relationship. He places a much higher value on her, spins out of control, is lost and manic when she shuts her door to him. </p>
<p>Speaking of panaceas, things get uber weird when the company higher-ups call in a doctor to basically administer speed to the employees. Injected with a performance enhancing serum (business-man boner pills, anyone?), the copywriters are to gain focus, clarity, energy with one little shot. It seems only men take the drug and almost immediately foot races, and games of strength and fortitude fill the space. With the men turned little boys, the workplace is boiled down to its essence &#8212; &#8220;I can do it better, run faster, pee farther, than the next guy.&#8221; The serum causes quite the frenzied production, not to mention pretty serious side effects and hallucinations, but nothing that could actually count as usable, viable, ideas. </p>
<p>However, it is striking that the serum (and perhaps being on the brink of exhaustion) frees up emotional expression for the Mad Men. After the drug is administered, the fellas ask each other, “can you feel anything?” Though in reference to the serum taking effect, the question hangs starkly in the air. Do they feel? When and how? In the temporary “insanity” of sorts that follows, Don pleads with Sylvia on the phone shouting, “I’m feeling a lot of emotions!” Ken performs a bizarre yet marvelous soft shoe whilst expressing pent up hatred for his job, and Stan reaches out to Peggy seeking sex as succor for emotional wounds. Where this magical medicine is supposed to “fix” these men by creating efficient capitalist output, the episode uses the trip to explore much realer pains and ailments that expectations of masculinity won’t allow them to properly address. Why does my heart hurt? How and why do I work in an abusive environment? How do I grieve?</p>
<p>Don’s pain, of course, is central. For Draper, “The Crash” is about collisions within himself. Physical and mental smash together as his emotional detritus takes on somatic shape. After a particularly painful discussion with Sylvia, he collapses into a guttural cough that at some moments is indiscernible from sobbing &#8212; for this high power male exec, his sadness is his sickness. The cough threads us back to his past as Dick Whitman sick with a severe chest cold. His mother, rather than caring for the boy with hot chicken soup (the stuff that ads are made of) banishes him to the basement so as not to infect the others in the whorehouse with Dick’s supposed consumption. Layered with this painful lack of care is an even more twisted knot of memories. A whore takes him into her room, watches over him, nurses him to health, and then uses her power, age, and experience to take Dick’s virginity in what appears to be an abusive act. Yes, this could seem a cop-out backstory for a flawed character, but I don’t think it excuses his behavior, so much as gives it some context. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, Don Draper could hone the sadness of his past into the shiny, nostalgic, artifice of his work, his ads genius feats of psychological alchemy. In this episode, his feelings and history are overburdening the work. In his frenzied state he confuses work and home life in an unproductive and depressing manner. He spends all his time building an ad for himself, crafting the perfect spiel that will sell Don Draper, will get a foot back into Sylvia’s door. But, he’s also selling something to himself, the narrative that this woman is the key, the mother and lover that he’s always wanted but never had. Hopefully, the viewer discomfort churned up in episodes like this one will allow the audience to rethink Draper’s smoothness and make him a more nuanced character in a complex gender structure. One in which our performances as men and women are constantly negotiating power, expression, and perception. </p>
<p>All the edges of the episode suggest that there is no safety, people lie, there’s no one we can trust. Where early <em>Mad Men</em> revelled in the intoxicating allure of embellishment, this season is dipping into the emptiness and horror that can structure a lie. Peggy, though she harbors an avoidant past of her own, suggests that we have to let ourselves feel painful emotions, that we can’t “dampen [them] with drugs and sex,” but as one can imagine, this advice is not very popular. “The Crash” undoubtedly presents a male desire for care and comfort (coded as feminine) along with freedom from typical masculine roles, but sadly it suggests that truthfully engaging with such desires is a temporary madness that the right ad, right soup, right fuck can cure. It gives a compelling interpretation of the world of men then and now, tender, lost boys in beards and button up shirts, white-knuckling the wheel, holding on for dear life while secretly wishing to be in the passenger seat. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMC’s much anticipated <em>Mad Men</em> premiere came and went this past Sunday night and boy did it leave me feeling. . . funny.  This show that once revelled in style, laid on the cool and laid it on thick, has definitely gone through some changes.  Following Don Draper’s lead, where the feel was once confident, sexy, defiant, and unapologetically mysterious, it has now become heavily marked by paranoia, aggression, alienation, and tangible nervousness.  It’s not that these latter qualities haven’t always been there, I’d argue they have, it’s just that in this most recent season opener anxiety engenders the characters’ world much more completely. Fear is encroaching, and that beautiful coolness of old is hardly believable or available for our retro TV friends.  While I watched the premiere, it was joking and bad jokes that both caught my attention and best help me explain the feelings of discomfort creator Matt Weiner seems to be exploring this season.  </p>
<p>First of all, the show is framed with some pretty heady political issues made light of by The (proverbial) Man in each instance. The first image we see is that of a group of black men and women protesting for equal rights outside of Y&amp;R, a rival ad company. Upstairs in the building, a couple of idiot ad men ridicule the protesters claiming they should shut up and get jobs instead of walking around in circles. Noting the literal meteorological heat &#8212; if not the metaphorical kind &#8212; our privileged white man-children then pummel the crowd below with makeshift ice-water balloons. The joke only becomes unfunny to these fellows when the crowd comes upstairs and a woman (quite maternally) admonishes them for having hit not only fellow people, but a child, as well.  </p>
<p>Seeing this as a viewer feels strange and uncomfortable for many reasons.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> This is an ugly part of our country’s history and we’re seeing it played out again from the perspective of the privileged majority.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Mad Men</em> rarely takes up racial issues, often choosing to only glance at or gesture toward their existence. If you’re a fan of <em>Mad Men</em>, this scene further reminds you that hey, maybe such plot points should have been part of the storylines all along.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Though it’s good that we’re finally offered a more direct racial encounter on the show, it is still on the fringes of the real (read: white) story.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>  And if actual race relations and characters of color are going to miraculously become much more prevalent to the storylines, is the show going to do it clunkily/offensively or well?  Eep!</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m nervous about how this will be handled.  I already felt more than a little distressed by the good vs. evil melodrama in this episode. When the woman scolds the ad men she proudly, boldly huffs, “and they call us savages.”  I just hope that Weiner’s response this season is not a “noble savage” resolution to a white guilt problem. </p>

<p>Another political joke gone wrong? To really stick it to the bigoted guys from Y&amp;R and create a lot of buzz about the “good guys” at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, the company publishes an ad (that they can’t really afford) claiming they’re hiring a secretary, and unlike some other places, they’re an equal opportunity employer.  Take that Y&amp;R!  And there was much laughing and drinking of cocktails. . . that is until, as Roger so eloquently puts it, “the lobby is full of negroes.”  The team’s expensive little joke gets a little more expensive as now there’s pressure to not just talk the talk of their joke’s setup, but actually hire a person of color on staff.  This could be the transitional moment for both the office and the show, but it may be a token one and lodged in a joke at that.  Again, I felt a little funny about this.  Funny weird, not funny ha-ha.</p>
<p>But, the societal upheaval bits were mostly bookends; per usual, the camera was more firmly focused on the typical cast of characters and their dramas and growing pains.  Don Draper is turning the big 4-0 (alter ego Dick Whitman has been forty for half the year) and though he tries to play it off, this turn of events seems to shake him.  Don has settled down a little, is enjoying the comforts of wife (the second) and home and family.  He makes breakfast, he appears to follow up on his fatherly promises.  Ah, seems pretty nice and domestic for old Don!  Driving the kids back to their mother’s ghastly large estate he even jokes to “say hi to Morticia and Lurch.”  Funnier than this though was when he asks his sweet kiddies, “How old will I be when you’re forty?” His son quickly answers, “You’ll be dead.”  If you’ve been thinking, “This is Don’s world and we’re just living in it,” well, his son’s laconic statement about the fleeting nature of life and the revolutionary power of time might just change your mind.  </p>
<p>Megan, Don’s upgraded secretary, is young and lithe and lovely and only further makes a farce of the possible downfall of Draper. Her role in the episode is mostly to be peachy and youthful, impetuous and girlish. Throwing together a surprise party for Don at the last minute completely throws the office for a loop.  The late invitation, while just a fun whim to Megan, reads to the advertisers (you know, those makers and sellers of hidden meaning) as a harbinger of doom.  “Why was I invited so late?” “ Have I done something to be downgraded?” “ Am I getting fired?” “ Am I not fun at parties?”  Nobody knows where they fit in, if their office is good enough, if they’re even happy.  At the party itself, Megan is having a gay old time laughing the night away with a homosexual black man (oh, little miss counterculture!) while Roger gently has to assure Don that they aren’t laughing at him.  </p>

<p>Okay, here’s the bit you’ve probably heard a lot about. Megan performs a ridiculous french pop song and dance for Don at the party.  I guess it’s the French-Canadian version of the Marilyn “Happy Birthday.”  It was so cheesily bad that I kind of loved it, but again &#8212; awkward!  It was too sexy and intimate for a group of coworkers, who are basically strangers.  The twee-ness of the performance prickled against its audience and the dissonance was palpable. And the even weirder thing that follows is Don’s reaction to the ordeal.  </p>
<p>Anyone could see this was a stupid idea, this dumb surprise &#8212; Peggy claims the scenario has Lucy Ricardo written all over it &#8212; so, I wasn’t shocked that Draper was pissed and the Mrs. was pouty.  What was bizarre was the cleaning scene that takes place post-party.  Stripped down to her perfectly matching and tres sexy skivvies, Megan throws herself into tidying the living room&#8230;you know, like you do.  She starts yelling at Don to stop looking at her that he can’t have it, the looking, or her, the person, which apparently melts Don’s anger and turns him on to no end. UGH. Cue an aggressive physical struggle that boils over into passion and ends with a discussion about the once beautiful white carpet the party (and this disgusting rape fantasy) has sullied.  The white carpet is so lovely, so chic, it’s what everyone wants or thinks they want, but it’s completely impractical.  It can’t withstand life without being changed or destroyed.  Megan is disappointed and upset that a new one will be necessary.  Don, from the marketing perspective, has always been aware that you need multiple white carpets to sell the illusion of the perfect one.  There’s a lot going on here. </p>
<p>Though I was pretty disgusted by the bizarre sexual display, I think (I hope) it was there to make us feel gross.  We can read this moment as a nasty reminder of how desperate Don is behind his mask of dapper masculinity.  Truthfully, he doesn’t really know what he wants or needs &#8212; he makes his decisions based on what people tell him he should desire or what he shouldn’t dare to take.  His persona is attractive, but empty and reliant upon women and others lower than him in the hierarchy.  He has all the set pieces of a good life, but there is no concrete experience of happiness he can cling to &#8212; he’s still going to die some day.  It’s only in the practice of forcibly taking, or owning, or exerting power that he appears passionate. In a culture of comparison, he and the other characters are better at figuring out if they look happy than they are at comprehending/experiencing satisfaction.</p>
<p>Everyone, I mean everyone is makes fun of Don, but Roger assures him it’s only because he’s happy. </p>
<p>Is <em>Mad Men</em> trying to figure out what its idea of happiness really is?  Don does have the immaculate white carpet, a wife willing to sully it with a party, a nameless (black? brown?) girl to come in and clean it, and the money to replace it if he pleases.  I imagine this season will further suss out what it means to be happy for each of our regular characters and maybe a few new ones.  At this point the only difference seems to be having the power to be in on, or at least aware of, the jokes instead of being completely alienated by them.</p>

<p>Mysterious, floppy-haired, droopy-jeaned, an excellent leaner, Jordan Catalano of <em>My So-Called Life</em> is the archetypal irresistible slacker bad boy of your dreams.  He seems perfect because (besides being beautiful) he is quiet and deep, soulful, full of longing.  He plays guitar, wears vintage/thrift store clothes (or is he poor?!  Sad puppy!) and he can’t read.  It is clearly your duty/destiny to keep his tender secrets, make out with him whilst touching his greasy locks and make sure he graduates high school.  </p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong> his mystery may just be emptiness.  He won’t hold hands with you in the light of day (let alone in front of Tino).  Once the poetic mid-smooch mumblings are gone, what will you have left to talk about?  Girlfriend, Catalanos must roam free in the angsty wilderness.  If you love him, let him go.</p>

<p>Foxy, easygoing, carefree, Daniel Desario of <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> fame is a freak of hottie proportions.  Lanky and loveable, he shoots sweet smirks in your direction across the cafeteria table he non-chalantly invited you to sit at.  He stays out late, drives a sweet car, skips class and here’s the sexy part&mdash;he always asks you along!  This must mean that he loves you!  Why would he be so nice, so flirty, so easy and unimaginably cool?!  He’s not like your last crush, Jordan, at all!</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  he’s a total high school con man&mdash;a grifter in a leather jacket.  Sure he thinks you’re an okay chick and all (for a brainy square, you’re kinda cute) but he mostly wants you for your homework, your excellent house party digs and whatever fleeting entertainment you can provide.  This kid has acting chops that will get him through life.  As adorable as he is playing D&amp;D with your little brother, Desarios can’t be trusted.  </p>

<p>Okay, so he’s not the most classically beauteous of the bunch, but as far as bad boys go, he’s got the attractive attitude down pat.  Let’s face it, funny is sexy and Dave’s got funny in spades.  And this isn’t your run-of-the-mill humor either, this is mean, satirical, wry, jerky, weird and intellectually inane stuff.  There’s something refreshing about a television figure who doesn’t pander to his guests (take a cue Jay Leno).  If Dave respects you, you know you’ve earned it; if he doesn’t, he will verbally eviscerate you on camera then re-air the footage ad nauseum.  Uber private and hermit-like, he’s got the secretive thing going like the dudes above, he loves his mama and he’s fiercely smart.  What’s not to like?</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  Um, commitment issues like whoa.   It’s all well and good to not be the marrying kind, but don’t cheat on your looong time girlfriend, the mother of your child, with each and every broad who works in the CBS studios.  The snark is attractive, but boys like Dave use that crap to keep people at a distance.  I don’t care if you get the urge, do not hop on his desk and show him your boobies.  He won’t show you much in return.  </p>

<p>Not McDreamy or McSteamy, Alex Karev’s nickname is “Evil Spawn.”  Sounds hot and unavailable already, am I right, ladies?!  So, this <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> guy is a total ass.  He’ll walk all over you, steal your surgeries and then laugh in your face about it.  But then, then! You catch him whispering lullabies to a preemie in critical condition and your heart melts like so many hospital cafeteria pats of butter.  He had a rough family life, a mentally ill mother, an abusive father, of course he had to be rough and scratch his way to the top.  Of course, he’s all dark and twisty and sexilicious.  Following Freud to a <em>t</em>, he tends to fall hard for crazy girls.  You’re a crazy girl!  You understand why he acts out, why he is how he is.  It’s a match made in Mercy Grace heaven!</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  He sleeps with everyone and he’s not just a little damaged, he’s got serious problems.  Good guy over all? Yes.  But he fights hard and dirty to protect himself, and you don’t deserve that abuse.  Let him work on himself for a while.  Re-visit after he’s had some therapy.  Maybe when he’s head of pediatrics.  Until then, avoid running into him in closets, sleeping quarters, or empty rooms of any kind.</p>

<p>The Big Kahuna.  <em>Mad Men</em>’s Don Draper is the Everest of bad boys.  You know, you climb on because it’s just majestically there.  Wow, I’m dirty.  Anywho, he’s gorgeous, sleek, dressed oh-so-finely.  Oozing confidence, one flick of his cigarette says, “even I would fuck me.”  On top of this already selling attitude, he has the magical Desario effect of feigning rapt interest in you along with a little softness, a quiet dreamy impenetrable depth.  He thinks aloud; he lets you see his creativity burst forth so you think you’ve witnessed a little miracle.  He says All. The. Right. Things.  He’s a hot commodity and you’re buying it.</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  come on, anything that lovely can’t be real.  He’s a lie wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in five more lies.  Go ahead and sleep with him if you must, but know that you’re just buying a ticket to the Don Draper experience.  I repeat, DO NOT MARRY.  He is for amusement purposes only.  Men like Don, if that is his real name (it’s not) get around.  If you are not the kind of 60s gal who can self-assuredly buy and use prophylactics, then I suggest you stay home with your Sears and Roebuck massager.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When you think “Mad Men,” you most likely think of Don Draper all pressed and neat, dark secrets lining his smartly tailored jackets, beautiful lies lingering on his lips.  You might think of Betty, the picture of grace (or Grace Kelly) quietly suffering her domestic incarceration behind the mask of perfect pink lips and expertly lined eyes.  Or maybe you can’t get Joan out of your head.  The way she walks down the hallway of the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce offices you can’t help but imagine the symphony that accompanies her cool sashay and impossibly girdled buoyancy.  But what about the little guys?  Those little guys with reason to be mad who are hardly men or women?  What do we make of the kids on the show? They certainly don’t seem “alright.”

You might think of Betty, the picture of grace (or Grace Kelly) quietly suffering her domestic incarceration behind the mask of perfect pink lips and expertly lined eyes.  Or maybe you can’t get Joan out of your head.  The way she walks down the hallway of the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce offices you can’t help but imagine the symphony that accompanies her cool sashay and impossibly girdled buoyancy.  But what about the little guys?  Those little guys with reason to be mad who are hardly men or women?  What do we make of the kids on the show? They certainly don’t seem “alright.”</p>
<p>The children featured on <em>Mad Men</em> have often caught my attention and from what I can gather from the first few episodes of the fourth season, it seems like the Draper kids will be examined more closely and in greater depth.  On the most superficial level, Sally, Bobby and baby Eugene, serve as fictionalized representatives of childhood in a particular era in U.S. history.  The show very clearly complicates the Beaver Cleaver mythos of the 60’s by showing us a perfect-looking yet dysfunctional family—one more akin to our favorite baby boomers’ stories of the past than a Nick-at-Night portrayal of yore.  On <em>Mad Men</em>, childhood is a time when knuckles were rapped, arms pinched and bottoms beaten.  We see the little Drapers struggle with parental love that is tough, lacking and/or ill-communicated.  There is an almost funny bluntness to the missing care for these children especially as the show’s familial scenes provide a stark contrast today’s very child-centric views.</p>
<p>For example, Betty isn’t thinking at all of her daughter’s “self-esteem” when she calls Sally fat and says she has the makings of a good “little lesbian.”  Don, in turn, plays the archetypal absent father.  Never there, he becomes the perfect object of his children’s affections.  His returns at the doorstep are met with squeals of joy as he comes bearing gifts from far away. Don&#8217;s persona as father (similar to many other facets of his identity) is a blank screen on which his children project their desires.  Every now and again he’ll furrow his brow over his part in his children’s futures, but he rarely does anything to change their situation for the better.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="559" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/15/mad-childhood/madmenkids1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/madmenkids1.jpg" data-orig-size="500,333" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="MadMenkids[1]" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/madmenkids1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/madmenkids1.jpg?w=500" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/madmenkids1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="Don and the kids" title="MadMenkids[1]" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-559" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/madmenkids1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/madmenkids1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/madmenkids1.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />On another level, the children also act as interesting reminders of consumer culture.  This is a show about advertising, after all, and <em>Mad Men</em> smartly delivers the darling Drapers as more than just a throwback to bygone times.  When they are left on their own, ignored, or neglected, they do what comes so naturally even today and bask in the warming glow of the television.  Little demographics incarnate under <em>the</em> Don Draper’s own roof, the kids become the open vessels into which Don’s advertising pours.  The absent father reaches them through the mysterious amalgam of the media.  Kind of an interesting linkage to think about in a present where a family might text each other while watching <em>Mad Men</em> in the same house, no?  Take the leisure time of the middle class lifestyle, a lack of parental care and add in the modern achievements of technological distraction and you get a cohort of children who desire things, kids with psychic and emotional voids that need to be filled—the life’s blood of the ad game. </p>
<p>So, lucky for Don, the kids aren’t alright? Sad, but weirdly true.</p>
<p>Most recently we’ve seen Don win a Clio for a commercial featuring a young version of himself imprisoned behind the bars of a regular kitchen chair. His mother mops the floor into a bright glow, but our lonely cowpoke’s sadness radiates and resonates far more than the product. And of course we’ve just witnessed the infamous masturbation episode in which poor Sally is slapped and admonished for touching herself. While Don gains recognition for his disturbed childhood but also begins to circle the drain of a violent alcohol addiction, I’m left wondering how Sally’s future will unfold. It’s easy to imagine her drugged out and oversexed in a dingy seventies nightmare, but I’d prefer to see her grow angry and strong, the kind of “lesbian” her mother would hate…and envy.</p>
<p>But, AMC might not let us see that far into the future. So, for now, do me a favor and the next time you’re watching <em>Mad Men</em>, take a closer look at Sally and young what’s-his-name and the other one.</p>
<p>They could use the attention.</p>
