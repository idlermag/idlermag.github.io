										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comic books aren’t great with beginnings and endings, to be honest. As a serialized medium, very few stories have their complete start and finish in a single volume and often rely on a whole host of other stories to make complete sense. When I was a kid, though, nobody I knew really cared if it all made complete sense. The experience of reading a comic was immersive and fantastic and yes, made you want to get more of the same, but not necessarily because anything was missing in the book you just finished. No, I wanted more because every comic built another unique experience on top of what I had just gotten, sort of like a messy stack of bricks. Gaps existed, mortar would gush out around the edges, but I was building my sense of imagination, not some fortress of continuity. If it toppled, no one would get hurt. I could just reuse and rearrange the bricks in a new formation.</p>
<p>The single-issue story definitely helped this process along when I was growing up. There aren’t too many of those today, as readers have gotten older and simultaneously more demanding that every comic be a compelling starting point for new readers, but also continue to reflect everything that has come before it. The done-in-one story (or is it one-and-done? The debate rages.) is largely looked upon as filler, or an interlude, or at worst, a waste &#8212; easily skipped over as the main serial will pick-up its next six to eleven part story next month. I love a great serial, don’t get me wrong. The cliffhangers. The continuing subplots. The ability to look back from the end to see the clues laid months ago at the beginning. These are all awesome aspects of storytelling you can’t get in a single 20 pages &#8212; to the same degree anyway. But as a kid, nothing made me more happy than having a single book I could read again and again and again, and enjoy a little bit differently each time, without having to track down part 3 of 4, or worry about how Superman managed to be here AND in <em>Justice League of America</em> the same month. He just was. </p>
<p>See how easy that is?</p>
<p>I have a few of these books littered throughout my collection. They often are the single issues I see on a rack or in a drawer at a comic shop and just can’t help myself from buying again. Yes, I know I have two copies already &#8212; the ripped up original from when I was 9 and the one adult-me bought to replace it in my “formal collection” &#8212; but this one is near mint, people. And how often am I going to be able to relive that flicker of joy that I got from buying it the first time. If even an infinitesimal spark remains, it’s worth experiencing. I just can’t explain the compulsion any other way. So came across my path <em>Detective Comics</em> #526 the other day.</p>
<p>An extra-sized comic (cover-price $1.50!) from May 1983, this issue was billed largely on the cover as Batman’s 500th appearance in <em>Detective Comics</em>, as the Dark Knight made his intellectual debut in the title’s 27th issue way back in 1939. Not quite a round year anniversary, this story stood out at the time, however, due to its gold ink cover accent and square bound size, not to mention featuring the headshots of pretty much every major Batman villain to date swirling around Batman and his crime-fighting colleagues. Good enough for me. And the cover, pretty cleverly designed from my now-art director’s standpoint as well, lived up to its promise. Upon opening, the reader was treated immediately to a congregation of every major criminal the Bat-family had put away in these 500 issues, and a foreboding title, “All My Enemies Against Me!” Seeing these purveyors of purloinment lined up across a theatre stage was a young reader’s dream, as I could finally have one place to count off and name all the baddies that previously remained scattered throughout my memory and piles of books. </p>

<p>And immediately there was controversy! Talia al Ghul was in love with Batman and wouldn’t go along with the Joker’s plans, no matter how many times she’d tricked the Dark Knight in the past. And Catwoman too had recently moved over to the side of the angels, quickly scooting out on her invite to mistakenly fued with Talia later on. Two ladies vying for Batman’s affections! Even the young homosexual in me was a little bit impressed. Or maybe jealous. And frankly confused. If I were Batman, the choice would clearly be the one wearing the outfit and motif that most closely resembled my own. Catwoman was a no-brainer, Bruce. Let’s be honest.</p>

<p>Batgirl’s arrival on the scene to shake-up a constantly brooding Dick Grayson &#8212; we were long past the golly-gee portion of Robin’s adventures &#8212; was another high-point for me, as the dominoed daredoll was treated with some rare respect in the Batbooks here by prolific writer Gerry Conway. Previously written as having been easily thrown off the trail of the boys’ secret identities, Babs here all but rolled her eyes at Dick’s surprise. She is, after all, a detective. And as the two of them cycled off to track down the parents of young circus trapeze artist Jason Todd (there’s a plot clue in there for the savvy Bat-fan), you could feel that both Robin and Batgirl were not only equals to each other, but growing closer to living up to the example set forth by their mentor himself, the Batman. It was a unique time for all of these characters, long before the family expanded and sons and daughters took turns seeing who could frown the hardest. You feel as if they’re a true family, but one just about to go their separate ways, leaving a significant hole to fill in Batman’s home and methodology.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11210" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/30/one-and-done/oneanddone3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,416" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="OneandDone3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=416" alt="Jason Todd" width="640" height="416" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11210" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=98 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=195 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> </p>
<p>Enter young (red-haired) Jason Todd, who discovers the entrance to the Batcave, finds a spare costume in a dusty old trunk, and stows away inside the Batmobile as Batman, Talia and Catwoman speed away to track down Killer Croc. In the course of events, Jason hears Croc is responsible for the deaths of his parents earlier in the issue, and newly orphaned, flies into action alongside the original orphaned warrior himself. By the end of this issue (Phew! A lot happened here!), you can see Bruce and Jason walking the grounds of Wayne Manor, a new partner in the making just as his previous one is about ready to spread his wings and leave the nest. </p>
<p>Exactly thirty years later, I can recall every panel, every word of this comic like Watchtower bell-ringers know the Bible. I know this book to such a degree that it even begs the question why I needed to buy another (or any) copy. It’s all right up here in my head, and probably will be until the day I die. And it doesn’t much matter that it was Batman’s 500th appearance, or the first time we got to see Jason Todd in costume. It was so many things and none of them. Maybe it was just the time of my life I read it. Or maybe I was just more open to the experience it promised me than I would be today, amid a flush of other books and comics and papers begging for my attention. In any event, I feel blessed to have the memory of such a unique experience and that it remains today as an important one to me.</p>
<p>I have no doubt my time writing for <em>The Idler</em> will remain much like that as well. Before starting my column here, I was a frequent tweeter, sure, but hadn’t been offered the very generous opportunity to share my words with such a distinguished audience, alongside such a brilliant group of authors. It’s an experience that has opened my eyes to things I never thought about, forced me to be prolific, motivated me to expand my skills, and led me to meet and partner with some absolutely amazing people. So, thanks, everyone, for the memories, and may they live on here in perpetuity for us all to revisit and reclaim just a little bit of that spark every time we do.</p>
<p>And for those who want to read more from me, I will be easily found at <a href="http://www.comicosity.com/" target="_blank">Comicosity.com</a>, taking with me the mantra I have since ingrained in my writing (and living) this past year and some months: <em>refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy</em>. May it always be so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently at a party in which I met a gentleman who tried to convince me that the third <em>Matrix</em> film is the finest of the trilogy. Needless to say, I was aghast and spent the next several minutes arguing against this delusional notion until finally my wife wisely and diplomatically separated me from this poor misguided individual. The conversation got me thinking about how almost everyone I know likes at least two or three widely reviled popular culture creations. There’s the friend who thinks that Guns N’ Roses’s <em>Chinese Democracy</em> was a masterpiece which was well worth the wait. The girl I know that loved <em>Battleship Earth</em> or the guy who doesn’t know why NBC didn’t produce a second season of <em>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</em> (actually, that last person would be me.)</p>
<p>It is surprising that we often feel very strongly about the need to defend and justify our beliefs about these underappreciated cultural works. In doing so we are not only defending the things in question but also our own tastes and in some way our validity as social and cultural commentators. It matters to many of us that our friends and colleagues respect our opinions and understand why we believe what we do. Which is why this column is about my appreciation of <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin, The Boy Wonder</em>. The often-delayed Frank Miller and Jim Lee ten issue series is almost universally despised by both critics and comic book readers alike but I have a strange affinity for the story. Reviewers generally praise Lee’s artwork but despise Miller’s storytelling. I, on the other hand, appreciate both creators’ work, and find that the two mesh together to create something unique and exciting, the likes of which I have never seen. The narrative showcases a nearly psychopathic Batman who seems to be teetering on the brink of sanity as he drags a twelve year old Dick Grayson into his war against crime. There is nothing likable about this Dark Knight, he’s extremely violent, overly profane, masochistic, and bordering on sadistic. He is not a good guy and may not be a hero. He is a deeply troubled man who tortures criminals, kidnaps little boys, seems to be devoid of empathy, and is only concerned about himself. He is a highly unsavory character who displays many of humanity’s worst traits and is a role model for no one. </p>

<p>The logical question to ask at this point is; if this Batman is truly so unpleasant why do I like the story so much? In truth it is because this version of the Dark Knight has little to no redeeming qualities or social value. To my mind this Batman is the logical extension of many of the Caped Crusader’s traits taken to the highest degree. Batman has often been portrayed as disturbed, violent, arrogant, and pompous. These characteristics were soft-pedaled or muted by other more desirable qualities in past stories. This book enhances the Dark Knight’s core self and displays how unbecoming such a hero truly would be. I read it as a commentary on society in a post-September 11th world (the first issue was published in 2005.) The narrative asks the reader to consider what price is he/she willing to pay for security and what amount of freedom is he/she willing to sacrifice in the process. I find the effort to be bold and rather forward thinking. It follows the tradition of Miller’s own <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em> and Alan Moore&#8217;s <em>Watchmen</em> in presenting the negative aspects of superheroes but it does it at an intensity never before seen in a story featuring one of the comic industry’s best known characters. I can understand why some readers are repulsed by the effort but I believe that such feelings are the point of the story. We should be repulsed, the idea that a mentally unstable billionaire dresses as a bat and violently fights crime would bother many of us if these events happened in the real world. I understand that Batman is fantasy and that escapist literature provides an avenue to flee reality for awhile but isn’t Miller’s notion of a maximized Batman something worth considering?</p>
<p>The other reason that I like <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> so much is in many ways the opposite of my above way of thinking. This Batman story takes place in the same universe as Miller’s most notable Batman stories: <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>, <em>Batman: Year One</em>, and <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</em>. When combined these stories create a dense narrative that presents the Dark Knight at the beginning of his career and at the end. This progression is fascinating and allows the reader to see how the Batman from <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> was created and how he changed. It provides insight into numerous plot points and story details that were before unexplored. Miller has created a sinister universe in which not only Batman has become a super-enhanced version of himself but so too have other heroes like Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow. Like Batman, these characters’ core qualities are maintained but are taken to their furthest logical extent. <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> rewards readers that follow along closely and connect the dots from previous stories. The narrative also contains numerous Easter eggs from throughout DC Comics history and encourages the reader to consider Batman’s mythos and how the character has progressed since 1939 when he began as a hardcore vigilante.</p>

<p>So, that’s my overall spiel. I doubt I’ve convinced many of you because I imagine a large number of readers find the story to be too distasteful to stick with and also because I didn’t give any concrete examples from the book. The problem is that I don’t think I have room to fit any good illustrations into this column. To remedy this I am going to use future columns to review individual issues of <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> and give tangible examples of why I think the narrative is so good. Imagine me as the guy at the party who is trying his best to convince you to rethink something you have written off as inferior. Feel free to argue with me, I’d like the input and relish the challenge. Hopefully the hors d&#8217;oeuvres are good, the beer is plentiful, and I don’t have spinach in my teeth.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Very few things titillate us like a good serial killer story. Those who kill irrationally have become our new movie monster, as the horror of a Frankenstein’s Monster or Dracula has waned in our imagination over the decades. We see vampires and werewolves as teenage celebrities more often than not in today’s media, but serial killers. . . the spectacle of that is still moderately gruesome. Sure, we’ve begun to pick it apart with things like <em>Dexter</em> and <em>Hannibal</em>, primetime television that humanizes the psychology of mass murder to such a degree it can seem at times less than fascinating. That said, show me a photo of John Wayne Gacy as Pogo the Clown and I still get the shivers. Real life terrors still run circles around imaginary creatures.</p>
<p>Having spent a fair amount of time in graduate school researching serial killers, of both true crime and fiction, I’ve come to notice a particular rhythm to their tales that takes effect, as well as that of the heroes who pursue them. It is most often in the investigator, not the investigated, that we can actually know the depths of depravity to which these modern day monsters sink &#8212; for you can’t actually experience it in the killers themselves, so overwhelming is their psychosis. Pure sociopathy is a vacuum, and like the horror film tagline says, “In space, no one can hear you scream.” But the terror and frustration experienced by the obsessed cop or unhinged profiler is palpable and loud by comparison. And if their own psychosis is also on display? Well then, all the better.</p>
<p>In their 1998 mini-series <em>Torso</em> &#8212; published first by Image Comics and later collected by Marvel Comics &#8212; writers Brian Michael Bendis and Marc Andreyko unravel the events of Cleveland’s real life serial murder from the mid-1930s. Depicting the investigation into twelve unsolved murders, all involving victims whose heads and other body parts were removed, this true crime story begins, appropriately, with the arrival of new Public Safety Director Eliot Ness. Having developed his reputation as the leader of the Untouchables, a band of police who attempted for years to put Al Capone behind bars in Chicago, Ness is no stoic hero standing against an unknowable evil. His own insecurities and blind spots provide ample mirror for the unseen horror behind an increasingly bloody canvas of his new hometown.</p>

<p>Ness is clearly a man experiencing the dark side of fame, as his inability to finish the job he set out to do in Chicago still haunts him upon arrival in Cleveland. The Torso Killer, as he soon discovers, is his second chance at the brass ring &#8212; and one he can’t afford to leave untidy as he did with Capone. Jumping into the investigation already in progress by detectives Simon and Myrlo, Eliot Ness is not exactly a dynamic figure, but his own insecurity and failures drive much of the action moving forward. Torn away once again from experiencing normalcy with his too long patient wife, Ness’ own ego drives him to burn down the shanty homes of an entire community in poverty, keep communication with the serial killer a secret, and ultimately lose the battle once again against a criminal too many steps ahead of him. If the killer’s psyche can be imagined as an emptiness of sorts, then his pursuer’s decisions are a jumble of fragments &#8212; actions that, like clues which nag, repeat and magnify, remain scattered and doomed to incompletion.</p>

<p>Bendis is at once partnered with Andreyko on narration and solely illustrating the series, a rare exhibition of his significant artistic prowess of which we haven’t seen much in recent years. Combining dark inks with photo collage and repetition of panels, Bendis develops the look of the title to mirror a climbing psychosis, even in the quietest of moments. From panels that rotate like stairways in darkness to newspaper headlines superimposed on the spaces between panels, the intense layering effect the writer/artist employs perfectly captures the frustration and overwhelming nature of the investigation. The same clues stare back at Ness and his team, taunting them more severely with each new body that surfaces. And as politics conspire to confound the policemen all the more, pages of repeating images echo and shatter any sort of clarity the detectives could achieve. It’s only in the explosion of one seemingly careless detail that a lead on the killer develops, and the formerly dark landscape opens up to dramatic white.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11152" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/02/true-crime/torso3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/torso3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,438" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Torso3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/torso3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/torso3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/torso3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=438" alt="postmark" width="640" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11152" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/torso3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/torso3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/torso3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=205 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Tonal shifts and compulsion aside, the magnificence of this story comes frequently in the form of creative layout, as Bendis truly harmonizes his sense of pacing and patter &#8212; core competencies for nearly every of his narrations for over twenty-five years &#8212; with the page itself. Every texture one might expect from a film noir classic is absorbed onto and spread across the two-dimensional surface. Titled camera angles and deeply drawn shadows cast every motivation into question, and create a harrowing atmosphere through high contrast rendering. What could come off as overly simple instead represents the icy façade of our killer, a gap between his intense darkness and the unblemished page he means to sully so completely. If Ness’s motivations are foggy and grey, certainly the Torso Killer’s are crystal clear, a division between good and evil as sharply severed as the head from one’s body, and in as few strokes as possible.</p>
<p>Worth noting is a strong subplot between detectives Simon and Myrlo, where the former confides in his partner, after much brooding, the reality of his own homosexuality, and defends (himself) against the presumptions his fellow officer makes about the criminality of perversion and vice versa. Simon stands out as a deeply honest portrayal of a good man living his truth long before social acceptability of one’s gayness could make its way to him. While the character isn’t necessarily portrayed as out and proud &#8212; something that would be a clear anachronism for 1930s Midwestern culture &#8212; Simon has a clear sense of his own identity, and Myrlo’s acceptance amid doubts is a wonderfully touching moment in an otherwise chaotic series of developments.</p>

<p>In standard true crime fashion, the events of <em>Torso</em> remain a cold case, never truly resolved in the case files, much less the minds of Ness’s constituents. The reader, however, is left with a deeply satisfying tale of how darkness comes to the unsuspecting, and mania is not the exclusive property of the criminally insane. It’s right that the killer never faces justice, in a sense, as the protagonists’ own flaws defy resolution as well. We do get to look into the face of evil by the story’s end, but all we’re left with is a central, captivating dilemma. What remains most disturbing &#8212; the monster’s ultimate success or the hero’s inevitable failure? This is the stuff of modern horror.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I pulled into my office parking lot this morning and turned off the car I noticed that the digital dashboard clock showed “6:16.” In my early morning pre-coffee daze my mind registered that 616 is the main Marvel universe’s designation as provided by Alan Moore. I always respected Moore for giving the universe a seemingly random number. It seems egotistical that DC’s central stories would take place on Earth 1 (not to mention that the older characters’ home was somehow designated Earth 2. The Justice Society of America and their descendents should be on Earth 1 out of fairness, logicalness, and respect for one’s elders.) No matter what the worlds are named parallel Earth stories hold a special place in my heart. I love the idea that the existing possibilities are so numerous that we can scarcely imagine them all. There are worlds so strange and unencumbered by continuity than almost anything can happen. Its limitlessness is intoxicating. </p>
<p>Generally when I think of parallel Earths stories I imagine the superhero variety; costumed champions from multiple universes both battling themselves and world conquering villains. My favorite is <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, one the touchstone comic book stories of my childhood. Surprisingly, the best parallel Earths comic book tale that I’ve read in a long time isn’t a superhero narrative. Rather it’s a sad and heartwarming story of multiple lived and outcomes. <em>Daytripper</em> by Fabio Moon and Grabriel Ba isn’t a classic parallel Earths narrative and not just because it doesn’t feature superheroes. Rather, the story probably takes place on only one Earth on which events are shifted in order to display how small actions irrevocably change our lives. The ten issue-length stories have the feel of parallel worlds though, in which things are almost the same but something is slightly different. Here the difference is time and how the passing years change each of us and make us parallel versions of our younger and older selves. The stories provide a commentary on growing older and explore the different eras of a person’s life. Superhero stories are generally juvenile power fantasies that embrace the reader’s need to feel exceptional and value action over thought. In contrast, <em>Daytripper</em> investigates the reality of aging and death and searches for shared human experiences no matter how unpleasant or unsettling they may be. The stories also celebrates the large and small joys of life and relishes the moments that make us human. While superheroes make the extraordinary commonplace, Moon and Ba make the common extraordinary.</p>

<p>The stories are structured non-chronologically, so the reader bounces back and forth through the main character Bras de Oliva Domingos’s life. This effect has been used in numerous novels and films but it still provides discomfort to the reader accustomed to linear storytelling. It allows us to follow events and threads through Bras’s life and see how he and those around him grow, adjust, change, and decline. As with most fiction, the true joy in reading <em>Daytripper</em> is internalizing the narrative and reflecting on one’s own life and the lives of his/her parallel selves. What are the events that could have changed your life and what are the possible parallel realities that were created from such choices? Somewhere is there a you that took that job in London and now lives with a spouse in England? What happened to the 22 year old you that did join the Peace Corps? Or the you that decided that you were sober enough to drink although you’d had six beers? The decisions were endless and so are the possibilities. The latest episode of <em>Community</em> is focusing on the idea of a dark parallel universe, which spun out of an earlier story about choices creating parallel worlds. This most likely is reference to the original <em>Star Trek</em> series episode that features a dark universe version of the Enterprise crew. (I sometimes wonder if my goatee marks me as the dark universe me.) So, seemingly I’m not the only one that finds the idea of parallel lives interesting.</p>
<p>My favorite <em>Daytrippers</em> chapter is one in which a 32 year old Bras struggles to find his way in the world. While working as an obituary writer he attempts to write his first novel during his free time and the words aren’t coming. He struggles to escape from his successful father’s shadow and to free himself from his over-protective mother. I remember the 32 year old me that had many of the same problems. I wish I could visit his parallel world and tell him that everything gets better. Warn him to enjoy his time with his father before he dies. Counsel him to worry less and enjoy things more. Actually, most of that is pretty good advice for me today. Maybe my older self is trying to tell me something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mythical warrior wielding armaments of legend. A hero encased in metal who becomes a living weapon. A normal man thrown into extraordinary circumstances armed simply with a shield. A big green monster caught in the crosshairs of a secret government agency. All told, seven soldiers out to save the world from an incursion too great for any one of them to handle alone.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? It should, but it’s not what you think.</p>
<p>Five years after completing his epic run on the <em>Justice League of America</em>, writer Grant Morrison set out to reimagine Marvel Comics’ <em>Avengers</em> in the DC Universe with 2005’s mega-series event <em>Seven Soldiers</em>. Seven 4-issue series, each starring a different character in a solo tale, were bookended by two specials that tied them all together &#8212; without ever having any of the heroes meet each other. In a distinctly post-(post-)modern take on the super-hero team, Morrison gave each protagonist an individual and specific role to play in the defeat of a common foe, but maintained each hero as a solitary, often self-conflicted figure. Long gone is the round table of Arthurian legend that most Golden and Silver Age teams found themselves encircling at times of crisis. These seven heroes &#8212; The Shining Knight, Bulleteer, The Guardian, Frankenstein, Zatanna, Klarion the Witch Boy, and Mister Miracle &#8212;  all play an integral part in the defeat of invading hordes of fairies from our own future, descendants of the very culture they wish to strip apart and destroy. Nevertheless, their conflicts of character reflect a millennial vision for super-heroics as much as the Avengers themselves reflected a post-1950s mentality of the Cuban Missile Crisis era, when patriotic teamwork and the dangers of nuclear power drew heroes together, not apart.</p>

<p>An underlying theme to nearly every character is that self-questioning that heroes rarely had, even in the much more introspective era of the Marvel hero forty years earlier. Klarion the Witch Boy lives in an underground village, deeply hidden from the rest of the world since its inhabitants left the 13 colonies with a single word (“Croatoan”) marking their departure. Part of a society not unlike that of <em>Logan’s Run</em>, where men and women practice Salem witchcraft only until reaching a certain age, Klarion begins his journey wistful for any sort of meaning when everyone’s ultimate fate &#8212; to be killed and become a mindless slave zombie &#8212; is predetermined. But once he finds his way to the great blue rafters of legend, and out unto the streets of New York City, his own sense of power grows exponentially and leads to a greater coup than the boy could have even dreamed.</p>
<p>Before putting on the helmet of the Manhattan Guardian, Jake Jordan was a broken man, having left the police force in a shooting scandal that claimed the innocent life of a young boy. With no job or way to support his fiancée, Jake was plummeted into a deep depression until the city’s greatest newspaper offered to make him its trademark super-hero/reporter. And Jake isn’t alone in his self-doubt, as two other protagonists &#8212; Zatanna and Mister Miracle &#8212; each spend a considerable amount of time engaged in the ultimate post-millennial activity, therapy. The daughter of one of the greatest sorcerers of our time, the powerful-in-her-own-right Zatanna can’t seem to raise her own self-esteem, much to the chagrin of her much less famous group therapy peers. And Shilo Norman, the escape artist known on every stage as Mister Miracle, would feel better about his fame and recognize his true power if he wasn’t undermined at every turn by the dark god DeSaad masquerading as his empathetic psychiatrist. These heroes, riddled by a psychosis only cured through glorious super-human action, may represent an even greater accomplishment to modern day readers than their heroes of old, for it is not only their physical enemies that each must overcome, but one’s own inner demons as well. Shades of Iron Man famously facing his own hazy alcoholic self in the mirror, their ultimate revelations become cathartic for all those who have ever overcome the life trap themselves and risen to fight again.</p>

<p>The Shining Knight’s journey too, while representing the complete opposite of doubt and shame, runs a road rarely taken in comic book form. Today, DC Comics’ most prominent transgender character, Sir Ystin is initially depicted as a girl masquerading as a man to earn his seat at the actual Round Table aside Galahad and the others. That said, his “truth” never seems as revelatory as one would presume, and to later creators’ credit, he stands as one of the most well-rounded depictions of the LGBT community in comics today. An honorable hero with bravery to spare, the Shining Knight isn’t confused about his gender identity as much as earning his place among the heroes of old, one battle at a time. It is in that sense that he has unsure footing along the path, refreshing in contrast to the lovely Bulleteer, the accidental hero who quite literally stumbles into her own destiny without desire or drive.</p>
<p>Truly, the monster Frankenstein may be the only hero who has no compunction about who and what he truly represents. A genuine product of mad science, armed with a sword and body parts from a dozen soldiers of legend, Frankenstein cuts a swath across the invading fairies, the king Melmoth and the queen Gloriana herself in the far flung future. He drags them back through time to face justice at the hands of S.H.A.D.E., the federal agency his own Bride operates. He is brute force, but not without the heart of a poet, and in that sense, poses a curious counterpart to his forbearer (and literary descendent, technically), the Incredible Hulk. Subject of the original science fiction novel, Frankenstein is precisely the hero our twenty-first century needs, despite his Victorian origins &#8212; a self-assured man visibly stitched together from many cultures and influences, a true melting pot of backgrounds while remaining stridently individualistic in nature. There is no cure for his condition, as Bruce Banner may seek, for he always already was the monster, just like the rest of us &#8212; and there’s nothing wrong with that. </p>

<p>Ultimately, for a tale broken into seven pieces and centered on the conceit of never meeting, <em>Seven Soldiers</em> is a deeply interwoven narrative, with details and motivations overlapping with increasing frequency as the series reaches its conclusion. Morrison layers time on space, different sets of soldiers upon those at the story’s lead, until you feel like an entirely new universe is being born right inside your hands. One of the few instances of a rich chronicle that implies deeper meanings and history without alienating one’s understanding of the current story, these vignettes and bookends all stand as a testament to the new century super-hero tale. Gone is the formulaic (ironic given the initial inspiration for the series) concept of the strongman figure in a cape, and in its place is a wicked boy and his cat, a self-aware monster with a broken heart, a young woman who grew up in lights on the stage, the embodiment of life housed in a celebrity performer, a good man down on his luck, the unwilling beauty queen, and a young champion choosing to not be confined by his own gender identity. Together they represent everything our culture needs to avenge on today’s terms. It’s about time our heroes caught up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These kids today. As I get older I struggle to not become of those, “these kids today” kinds of people. I worry that I might be becoming a crotchety old man though. You see, I grew up in the 1980s and hold a fondness for the decade and its popular culture. I also remember the how many members of the media in particular and society in general seemed to vilify my Gen X brethren. According to some we were the slackers that would bring ruin to American society, the thirteenth generation of Americans that would undoubtedly prove unlucky for the nation’s future. At the time everyone seemed to worry about us and openly express their displeasure with the Xers. These criticisms were unfair and rather reactionary, saying more about observer than the observed. I don’t want to be one of “those” people but I fear that it could slowly be happening. </p>
<p>I wonder if part of me is a little unfair to the generation that was born after me &#8212; commonly known as the Millennials. During my teaching days I got to know a number of students from the younger generation and one thing that continually confused me was the majority’s seemingly unending need for groupthink, which, in my mind, created a distressing lack of individuality and privacy. I grew up viewing group activities as breeders of laziness and a violation of my personal space. I was raised to believe in self-reliance, individual work, and personal space. Maybe the world has changed and I should fall in line or maybe we should have a conversation about privacy and individuality as a society. No matter what happens I doubt that society will return to how it was during my youth. </p>

<p>When I read Brian K. Vaughan and Marcos Martin’s <em>The Private Eye</em> #1 this week I thought about many of these subjects again. This digital comic book has received a large amount of much-deserved attention since it first appeared last week. For those of you that don’t know, the introductory issue is being sold <a href="http://panelsyndicate.com/" target="_blank">exclusively online</a> for whatever price the buyer wishes to pay and has seemingly been a big hit. While the business model maybe interesting, the story is what is truly important. The tale is a neo-hard-boiled detective narrative set in the year 2076. At some time between now and the start of the tri-centennial the Internet collapsed in such a catastrophic manner that it caused everyone’s information, no matter how private, to become public. This served as a catalyst for a societal swing in which Americans appear to value privacy above all else. Everyone seemingly has a secret identity, the police and the news media have merged into one entity, and the Internet no longer exists. (Interestingly, Los Angles has a subway-like public transportation system, ostensibly a move away from individualism.)</p>

<p>The story is a classic Sam Spade style detective tale with attractive dames, a Dick Tracy inspired police officer with wristwatch communicator accessory, a withdrawn and contemplatively nostalgic gumshoe, and a murderous villain with a secret agenda. The twist is that all of these elements seem new in this bright and colorful future setting. Martin’s artwork is dazzling and jumps off the page like a neon lit Las Vegas night. The artwork and story are much brighter and more inviting than most of the dystopian visions of the future produced during the last 50 years. I’ve been trying to describe the work to my friends and the elevator pitch that I have settled on is the Emerald City from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> meets <em>Blade Runner</em> mixed with Sam Spade plus a large dose of Easy Rawlins. I loved the first issue and can’t wait for the next one to arrive in a month. It’s rare these days that I get excited about a monthly comic book (<em>Saga</em>, <em>The Manhattan Projects</em>, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, and Scott Snyder’s <em>Batman</em> are the other current entries on the list.) I’m anxious to see where the story leads and what Vaughan and Martin have to say about the line between the personal and the public spheres.  </p>
<p>My favorite part of the story is undoubtedly a three page passage in which the main character tries to re-explain society to his senile grandfather. Assuming the older man is around 80 then we can place his birthdate about 1996, or someone that would be approximately 17 years old today. The almost completely bald senior citizen still sports a sleeveless “wifebeater” t-shirt, skinny jeans, and a body full of tattoos. When the reader initially meets the elderly gentleman he is desperately trying to get his iPhone to work although his grandson tells him that it hasn’t functioned for sixty years. The grandfather angrily replies, “I shared as much as I shared ‘cause my life was an open goddamn book. My generation was proud of who we were. We don’t have nothing to hide.” To which the grandson replies, “Yeah. That’s what they all said.” To me this is the heart of the story, the boundary between public and private. The understanding of what is overt and what is secret. Changing cultural mores that leaves one generation behind as another moves forward. As I feel the world moving on I wonder how soon before I will be the grumpy old man.            </p>

<p>Although I strangely identify more with the grandson than the older man closer to my birth year, I still sympathize with the grandfather. Getting older is rough and seeing the world change around you is something that society quite never prepares you for. It’s hard to accept that the world has moved on and you’ve been left behind. I suspect that the future will bring less privacy and more groupthink but I could be wrong. I am happy to know that the coolest new comic book of the year is a retelling of a classic Raymond Chandler like tale. At least these kids today have something decent to read.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession to make; I don’t understand some of Grant Morrison’s stories. What I mean to say is that I usually can follow the plot and generally comprehend the basic narrative but I feel like I’m missing important things within the tales. It seems as if I am only reading the surface and there is so much more below. My geek resume is strong &#8212; I read my first comic book when I was ten years old and I think I have a fairly decent comprehension of the how comic book stories generally work. I understand panel layouts, reoccurring themes and ideas, and have a working knowledge of comic book continuity and history. In other words, I’m a fanboy (albeit a middle-aged one). This means that I&#8217;m generally able to relatively easily process and understand the comic books I read each week. Frankly, many of them are reheating older ideas that I have encountered at least once and probably several times before. Superman loses his powers and has to prove it’s not only his super-abilities that make him a hero. (I’ve read it before.) Spider-Man has to protect the very society that fears and persecutes him. (I’ve seen it many times.) A comic book publisher creates a company-wide crossover that promises to change everything; I’ve invested more money than I can count into these tales and have the issues of <i>Invasion</i>, <i>Zero Hour</i>, and <i>House of M</i> to prove it.</p>
<p>Since I believe I know most, if not all, of the comic book tropes, it bothers me when I find something that I can’t completely wrap my head around. Some of Grant Morrison’s stories do this to me. <i>The Invisibles</i> &#8212; I’m still trying to grasp many of the stories’ imbedded concepts. <i>Arkham Asylum</i> &#8212; I think I understand it but then I wonder if I’m missing something. <i>Final Crisis</i> &#8212; don’t even get me started on this one. This confounds me because <i>All-Star Superman</i> and Morrison’s <i>Doom Patrol</i> are two of my favorite comic book runs ever. It irritates me that I can’t completely follow all of Morrison’s storytelling, especially since I agree with him that narrative is a powerful force that is widely underappreciated.</p>

<p>The other reason that I would like to better follow all of Morrison’s references and motivations is he wrote a comic book story that to this day still deeply resonates with me. It’s <i>Animal Man</i> #5, “The Coyote Gospel,&#8221; a heartbreaking tale of heroism and loss, the like of which rarely finds its way into superhero comics. The story features a Wile E. Coyote stand-in named Crafty (get it?) who serves as the story’s messianic figure. If you start with the elevator pitch of “Wile E. Coyote is Christ” you’ve already got a bizarre and amazing idea but Morrison adds heroism and sorrow to the mix. He somehow makes the reader care about the coyote savior while at the same time making us question ourselves and the world around us. A pretty mean feat for a “funny book” about a guy who received animal powers from aliens.</p>
<p>In “The Coyote Gospel,” Crafty comes from a Warner Brothers-like cartoon world where life is poor, nasty, brutish, and long. The land’s animated denizens are continually battling each other with Acme-type weapons and cartoonish methods. This causes only pain and strife though none of the cartoons question their lives. One day Crafty rebels against this system of violence and appears before his god. Appropriately, Crafty’s god is the artist who created him and presumably writes and draws the coyote’s adventures. The creator sends Crafty into the comic book version of the reader’s world and declares that the cartoon coyote has been sentenced to Hell. As long as Crafty suffers in this other existence the creator promises to allow peace to flourish in the cartoon world. Crafty is given a new body and suffers pain and humiliation again and again but he seemingly cannot die. The former cartoon coyote agonizes so his people (read animals) will not. He bears his world’s pain and sacrifices himself in order to fight misery and injustice. In the end, a conservative Christian, who believes that he is slaying the devil, kills Crafty. The coyote cries as he holds a crucifixion pose and dies in the middle of a four-way intersection, which looks suspiciously like a cross. The story ends with a giant hand using a huge paintbrush to fill in the artistic details. The artist god has killed Crafty and the pact that kept the animal’s world safe is now broken.</p>

<p>I read this story about once a year and it always manages to touch me and force me to ponder life, death, selflessness, and the nature of God. Not bad for a comic book tale featuring a Wile E. Coyote look-alike and a yellow and orange clad superhero. Maybe I want too much but I wonder if more of Morrison’s stories could touch me this way if I better understood them. <i>All-Star Superman </i>did. I reveled in connecting the dots between <i>DC One Million </i>and the twelve issue series. I loved the numerous winks to Silver Age stories and issue number six broke my heart. This makes me ponder if I should work harder to understand Morrison’s writing and do the necessary research to better connect with the author. Something about that idea leaves me cold though. If I have to studying in order to understanding Morrison’s work, will the benefit be the same? Will I feel it as deeply as I do with <i>Animal Man</i> #5? Maybe sometimes our histories and interests coincide with an author’s imagination and we cannot force this connection. Perhaps, it is something unique when a writer and a reader share a narrative bond and these moments should be treasured for their rarity. I probably will never completely understand Grant Morrison’s stories but maybe that’s a good thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a year since I wrote my first column for <em>The Idler</em>, and in that time I’ve been able to tackle a whole host of things I felt were important to me. From the earliest comics that drew me into the medium to some of the most thought-provoking material I’ve encountered as an adult, I’ve had my say. But there’s one thing I haven’t seriously touched upon. Something my editor even asked me about early last year and I held him off. A character near and dear to my heart. </p>
<p>Oh, Catman. </p>
<p>If you were hoping this week’s entry was going to be a font of philosophical pondering, turn back now. My love of Thomas Blake, the man of the yellow and orange, is not rational, ethical or even natural. It even makes my husband nervous. Sure, it’s pretty unlikely the actual Catman will ever spontaneously erupt from the comic page into three-dimensional life, but that slim cosmological chance already has my brain burning with possibility. </p>
<p>A little background. Featured prominently in <em>Secret Six</em>, the monthly series published by DC Comics from 2008 until 2011, Catman is a minor Batman villain, created in 1963, who rose from obscurity to join this misfit band of anti-heroes and mercenaries. A laughingstock before then, Catman has since become, under the pen of the mighty Gail Simone, a fierce Tarzan-like figure, highly intelligent (if not wise) and exhibiting great prowess in combat and hunting. He’s as primal a figure in mainstream comics as you can get.</p>
<p>Sure, he’s not Batman. He’s neither on the side of angels nor devils, not the big name at the marquee or the guy who gets the happy ending. But anytime he appears on the page, I’m there. Why, you ask? Let me tell you.</p>
<p><strong>1. He’s frequently naked. Just getting that out of the way.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a longstanding observation, which contends that writers are thieves and liars who steal stories from their daily lives and lie about the details. While this reflection is comical in nature, at its heart is a kernel of truth. Each of us &#8212; not only writers &#8212; is a storyteller who steals tales from the world and often fudges the facts, just a little, in the retelling. Don’t think you’re a storyteller? Ever post on Facebook? Compose tweets on Twitter? Send text messages? Talk to someone in person or on the telephone? If so, you’re a storyteller. In fact, it’s hard to image someone who, at some point in his or her day, does not relay some sort of information in a narrative form.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10977" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/02/28/saga-an-excitingly-new-same-old-story/saga11/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg" data-orig-size="684,356" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="saga11" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg?w=640&#038;h=333" alt="my name is Hazel" width="640" height="333" class="alignright size-large wp-image-10977" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg?w=640&amp;h=333 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg?w=150&amp;h=78 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg?w=300&amp;h=156 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/saga11.jpg 684w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, because we listen to and tell so many stories throughout our lives we are all experts on the format and rules of storytelling. We know the tricks to build suspense, to encourage audience support, and provoke an emotional reaction. We understand the complex word choices and delicate thematic structures inherent in every kind of story. (i.e. the cheating husband who fails the DNA test on <em>Maury</em> needs to look contrite and sound defeated, whilst the newest Bond villain should have a foreign accent, a physical defect, and hopefully a lap cat.) </p>
<p>Paradoxically, in a world filled with stories and storytellers there are no new stories. Unquestionably, we create millions, if not billions, of different stories every day, but each of these tales is just a refurbished version of an older narrative. There are no new kinds of stories only new understandings of classic plots. Don’t believe me? Think about it. When was the last time heard, read, or watched a tale that was unlike anything you had seen before? You probably haven’t had that experience since you were a child. Amazingly, though each of us knows the basic types of stories (romance, war, revenge, quest, etc.), we constantly crave new accounts of the accepted standards. On a basic, almost primal level, we, as human beings, need to constantly give and receive more stories. </p>
<p>That brings me to the comic book series <em>Saga</em> by Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples. On its face there is nothing new about <em>Saga</em>. It’s a space opera epic that features a young couple in love on the run, bickering in-laws, a bounty hunter, and an ongoing war. It’s <em>Star Wars</em> meets <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> with a dash of <em>The Terminator</em> thrown in for good measure. Thematically and structurally there is nothing new in <em>Saga</em>, and that’s why it’s so incredibly good. The simple truth is that Vaughn and Staples create an exceptional tale about extra-terrestrial characters that in no way seem alien. The reader knows the characters, understands what they need and how they feel, roots for or against them, and patiently waits every month to read more about their lives. Vaughn and Staples do what all good storytellers do, they makes us care about what happens on the next page.  </p>

<p><em>Saga</em> is narrated by Hazel, who is a newborn within the story’s confides but seemingly an adult during the future retelling. (This voice-over flashback style that has been used before in the movie <em>A Christmas Story</em> and the TV shows <em>The Wonder Years</em> and <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> also works well here.) Hazel tells the reader the story of her newly married young parents Alana and Marko &#8212;  star-crossed lovers whose species are at war with one another. Alana and Marko are clearly in over their heads; not only are they wanted suspects being chased by bounty hunters and royalty family members, they also are naïve parents and a newlywed couple who are still trying to adjust to their new living arrangement. They are tired, scared, stressed, and often utterly clueless, and in remarkable storytelling fashion their love almost permeates the page. Anyone who has left home, gotten married, had a baby, started a new career, or done a thousand other things that has made him or her feel vulnerable and more than a little uncomfortable will identify with Alana and Marko. Anyone who has ever been in love will understand the couple’s bond and will feel the terrifying helplessness of knowing that you cannot protect someone who you care about more than yourself. Alana may have wings and Marko ram-like horns but the two are the most human characters in comic book stories in recent memory. </p>
<p>One of many example of <em>Saga</em>’s storytelling power is found in the tale’s first few pages. The story opens with Alana giving birth to Hazel and Marko trying to help. Hazel’s future narration is scribbled on the page and stands in contrast to Staples&#8217;s beautifully expressive art. Hazel opines, “This is how an idea becomes real. But ideas are fragile things. Most don’t live long outside of the ether from which they were pulled, kicking and screaming. That’s why people create with someone else. Two minds can sometimes improve the odds of an idea’s survival. . . but there are no guarantees.” Here Vaughan is commenting on childbirth, storytelling, he and Staples&#8217;s new undertaking, and probably a dozen other things. While Hazel (and Vaughn) are commenting on high-minded ideas, Alana is giving birth and providing the following earthy comments to Marko, “Am I shitting? It feels like I’m shitting! Seriously, you’ll never have sex with me again if I defecate all over you. Unless you’re secretly into that. Please don’t be into that.”  After Marko tells her that she is beautiful Alana replies, “Right, because nothing’s more lovely than a fat woman spread-eagle in the back of an old body shop. It’s like something out of a fairy tale.” (By the way, do you see what Vaughn’s doing here,? Having a woman with small wings on her back meta-textually commenting on fairy tale narrative whilst she, herself, is essentially in a fairy tale.)</p>

<p>Needless to say, <em>Saga</em> is something special. I haven’t even discussed the other characters. The Will, the violent and yet moral bounty hunter who is pursuing Alana and Marko. Prince Robot IV, a television-headed member of a royal family. There’s also a Lying Cat, a ghost babysitter, a naked giant, and a visit from Marko’s parents. All of this comes together to create a narrative that uses the structure of what has come before to comment on both the medium and our lives. More importantly it’s a great story. It draws the reader in and makes one angry that he or she has to wait another month for the next edition. There is little new about <em>Saga</em> but that’s why it’s the best comic book I read every month.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagining the future can be tricky. </p>
<p>On one hand, we picture ourselves wearing jetpacks, flying through the open sky to get to work in the morning, and sending our relatives off (if we’re lucky) to live in space colonies on the moon. Love triumphs over our petty hatreds and we live in peace, not just with our earthbound neighbors, but with our friends across the grand universe.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we often also picture the worst: War comes to devastate everything we know. Governments fall into absolute, obvious corruption, separating the haves from the have-nots even more sharply than we experience already. Usually it’s snowing in this type of future, whether resulting from nuclear winter, global weather disruption or ash that just looks like snow as it falls across a smoky sky.</p>
<p>For years, the future in comic books leaned pretty heavily in the former direction, depicting a world of tomorrow that we all wanted to aspire to meet head on. The <em>Legion of Super-Heroes</em>, like <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>The Jetsons</em> on television, depicted a universe where planets were governed under one central authority each, and came together to form a United Nations of the galaxy. Young super-heroes from all over came together, each with his or her own special set of powers, to form a team in honor of their own hero from a thousand years prior &#8212; Superboy, the greatest example of cultural blending and good deeds in the history of the known universe. Like the Boy (later Man) of Steel, who came from one world to another &#8212; not to conquer, but to teach, protect and serve &#8212; these teenagers joined forces to police Earth and outer space, share adventures, make friends, and even sometimes fall in love.</p>
<p>And then, thirty-one years after the Legion first appeared and traveled in their &#8220;time bubble&#8221; to seek out young bespectacled Clark Kent in rural Smallville, it all changed for them. Economic collapse spurred on by a destructive war of science and magic led to a secret takeover of the Earth government by alien forces &#8212; and the dissolution of the galactic symbol of peace and collaboration that the super-team had become. 1989 saw the publication of a new <em>Legion of Super-Heroes</em> #1, with a first page simply entitled “Five Years Later.” Jumping right into the future’s future, readers were taken to a world that no longer admired the Legion, with its members now spread out across worlds, separated by politics and war, personal ties and grudges. Everything you knew was in question. And I couldn’t have been happier.</p>

<p>For someone like myself who spends an inordinate amount of time speculating on comic books, their characters and possibilities &#8212; both verbally and in my own head, <em>ad naseum</em> &#8212; it’s not hard to imagine how much this scenario appealed to me. Five years have gone by and heroes have gone missing, been changed, or had adventures that are now only alluded to in passing. This is speculation gold for a comic book continuity junkie, if, like me, you are patient enough to wait for answers. That said, this era of the team remains one of the most divisive in its history. Its fans (like myself) are hardcore lovers of the direction writer/artist Keith Giffen and his colleagues took, but its detractors are equally as &#8212; dare I say it &#8212; legion, citing the break from previous lore and status quo to be one of the biggest mistakes ever within the franchise. But what this series did best, I believe, was make the Legion of Super-Heroes both exciting for old time fans &#8212; who were treated to page after page of Easter eggs and hints about their favorite characters — and accessible for newcomers, who could get to know each member of the much smaller cast in a more intimate way.</p>
<p>At the center of the relaunch was Rokk Krinn, the hero of Braal once known as Cosmic Boy, now powerless and living in relative obscurity on an occupied planet with his pregnant wife. One of the three founders of the Legion, Rokk was understood to be the heart and soul of the team, and critical to their resurgence &#8212; that is, according to Chameleon Boy, ultra-rich son of the team’s initial funder and shape-shifting Durlan hero in his own right. These two men meeting to face off against the state of the universe was at the core of what it meant to be a Legionnaire: doing what’s right against all odds, and brotherhood (or sisterhood) above all else.</p>

<p>Giffen’s dedication to the nine-panel grid should look familiar to comic historians, as it was presumably an homage to the structure of Dave Gibbons’ epic tome a few years prior, <em>Watchmen</em>. Like <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Legion of Super-Heroes</em> now was taking a darker look at the super-hero tropes fans had grown comfortable with over the years, although it’s not like the book hadn’t dealt with darkness before. One of the first series to feature a major character death as early as 1967, the book saw heroes kidnapped and tortured, replaced by imposters, characters go insane, members conspire against each other and even put on trial for murder. But throughout that history, the Legion had its own structure as an institution to fall back on. Here, with members scattered across the stars and some even intellectually opposed to its reformation, the team was reduced to a shadow of its former self. All that was left was their pride and friendship. And that, quite frankly, was thrilling.</p>

<p>Ever the soap opera, the book didn’t just have Giffen to rely upon in its writing duties, as the long-time artist of the title (spanning back nearly a decade) was joined by husband-wife team Tom and Mary Bierbaum. The Bierbaums brought with them a real sense of the characters’ histories, having been avid fans of the book themselves, but also a sincere dedication to move these people forward in their lives and get to the root of their individual heroism. Ultra Boy, long the most carefree &#8212; can I say mimbo? &#8212; is reintroduced as a man in mourning, returned to his corrupt home planet and running a black market operation after the seeming death of his beloved Phantom Girl. Not just a personality shift in time of crisis, however, this development in Jo Nah’s characterization came with a series of revelations about his complicity in keeping one of the world’s most powerful sorcerers under control &#8212; all without ever breaking the façade of a man too dumb to lead the team effectively. Meanwhile, Shrinking Violet (Vi) returns from war between her native planet of Imsk and Braal a high-profile dissenter, but one racked with guilt over the people she helped kill on Rokk’s home planet. The specter of their mutual battle at Venedo Bay hangs over much of the first two years of this series, and remains indelibly carved on Vi’s own face, a scar across the artificial eye replacing the one she lost in war.</p>

<p>Vi’s renewed relationship with Ayla Ranzz, Lightning Lass, is also a hallmark of the series and a significant milestone for LGBT inclusion in mainstream comics. The couple was never treated differently from any other marriage or coupling in the series, frequently shown sharing quarters, expressing love and fighting side-by-side just as family members Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl would. The series also featured one of the earliest focuses on a trans character at DC Comics, as Element Lad’s longtime girlfriend Shvaughn Erin revealed herself to have been born male. Twenty years later, there is much to criticize about the motivations and reasoning behind Shvaughn’s journey as a trans woman, but I can attest that her inclusion in the tapestry of the Legion’s future meant a lot to me as a young gay man. Seeing a character I had read about for years come out in the pages of one of my favorite monthly comic books was empowering, and the effort these creators put in at such an early stage of the effort towards fair representation of the LGBT community is commendable to say the least.</p>
<p>Sadly, this iteration of the Legion lasted a mere five years, culminating in a complete reboot of the concept with younger, less traumatized versions of the characters taking center stage. Many of the developments in this era have resurfaced recently, including Vi and Ayla’s relationship, but much of what made this era so special to me is lost in later iterations, with new characters from the series never returning to the page, even in decades hence. What stands out so significantly for me in this world is that the boys and girls, the lads and lasses, were able to grow up, but never lost what made them heroes, even in the direst circumstances. They could still be funny, optimistic, and experience deep love and camaraderie despite being faced with the seemingly insurmountable odds of a government &#8212; to some degree, an entire United Planets &#8212; that didn’t want them to be together. The Legion, to them, was something too special to lose. And there’s no question in my mind that they were right. </p>
<p>Every Legion fan has an era they consider to be intrinsically <em>theirs</em>. Even if one loves all of them, there’s always one iteration that stands just a bit above the rest in his or her heart. This one is mine. No matter how many times I re-read it, I still get a thrill at the sight of Rokk’s unshaven face or Bounty’s mysterious smirk, because they truly were the people I wanted to be like someday. I imagined my own teenage self flashed forward into adulthood five years later and living in a future worth fighting for. The world could get darker but there would always still be room for hope in it. And honestly, that’s just as important a lesson to learn today as it’s even been.</p>
