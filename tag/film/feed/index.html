										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leviathan</em> (2012) straddles the line between documentary and avant-garde; composed entirely from footage shot on a large fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean, it hints at how life is lived on the boat, but exists primarily as a visual and auditory experience. Things happen, but there is no plot; our understanding is entirely derived from the images, sound, and what understanding (little, in my case) we might have of industrial fishing.</p>

<p>The film begins, incongruously, with a Bible verse, written in a Gothic-tribal font, then cuts to a black screen with the sound of the ocean churning. A light flickers in the bottom corner of the image, and eventually, we find ourselves on board a massive fishing boat, all clinking chains, painted metal, and winches. During the first ten minutes, we witness, through a camera strapped to one of the workers, the process of bringing up a net that’s been trawling the ocean, and then releasing the mass of slippery silver and pink fish caught in the trap. This labor feels, well, laborious, and has only just begun &#8212; when the sequence ends, we notice that light just barely turned the sky from black to navy blue.</p>
<p>The excitement and movement of the opening sequence belies the repetition and drudgery of the work to come. In two later sequences, the camera lingers on the men cleaning the fish, gutting and beheading them with an efficiency that comes from experience. To those unaccustomed to slaughter, the scene is almost enough to turn one to vegetarianism. As the men work, the camera pans down the side of the wooden bin where the newly caught fish are kept, awaiting their fate, to find it caked and dripping with gore. A group of skates are equally doomed; as a fisherman unceremoniously lifts one with meat hooks, another hacks off its wing-like fins and tosses them into a bin. The waste of the fish – heads, guts, and fins – is dumped back into the sea. With the camera sitting on the ship’s steel floor, a fish’s head sits upside down; its bulbous eye stares back at us, as if prompting a response. Then, we cut to another camera half-submerged in the sea, sometimes underwater, other times emerging into the air, as fish viscera slides out the side of the ship in a red sludge. If ever one needed a visual illustration of the term “biomass,” <em>Leviathan</em> offers it.</p>

<p>Matching the unsentimental vision of the labor needed to help feed a population eager for seafood, who in turn are shielded from the violence involved in securing those meals, is a vision of the sea as vast and all-encompassing. Shots where the camera is plunged into the water offer little but darkness and the muffled reverberations of the ship, interrupted only by the white streaks of the wake and the occasional offal. The film’s soundtrack of crashing waves, winches and chains, and the deep rumble of the engines takes on an ominous musical quality in these scenes; so much so that I imagined incidental music emerging just under hearing.</p>
<p>Whereas the scenes of labor lull you with a sense of repetition, the “underwater” sequences transform the sea into an aesthetic, where you glimpse only the occasional recognizable object &#8212; a chain, a fish, seagulls when the lens breaks the surface. <em>Leviathan</em> is one part <em>Jeanne Dielman</em> (1975), and one part <em>Dog Star Man</em> (1961-1964), though even together those films are not quite the right comparison. There is something more real, and more accidental, about <em>Leviathan</em>, something to do with the primal in the midst of the industrial. One of the last shots of the film shows one of the fisherman seated in the ship’s kitchen; the garbage from his finished meal litters the table and he looks towards us but slightly off-screen. It sounds like he’s watching <em>Deadliest Catch</em>, and what we can hear &#8212; dramatic music, narration, editing &#8212; differs so greatly from the experience we’ve just had. As the show continues, the fisherman slowly closes his eyes, obviously exhausted from his work, and the television cuts to a commercial for a colon cleanser &#8212; two final reminders of biological reality in this strange approximation of home, deep in the bowels of the floating factory. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Roger Ebert was the first film critic I read seriously. For years as a teenager I awaited his reviews every Friday, and his was the first collection of film criticism I ever bought. He taught me that one could disagree with accepted wisdom about a film, and reach one’s own conclusion about it; moreover, he taught me how to defend that opinion. I remember disliking David Lynch’s <em>Blue Velvet</em> (1986) because of Ebert’s review, and after seeing it years later and revising my opinion, his influence remained, because now the lesson had stuck &#8212; my conclusion was my own. Although I read him less in recent years, he appeared still as a model of someone who believed in both cinema and humanity. Although it is sometimes difficult to retain a trust in either, this is another of Ebert’s lessons worth remembering.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strangely enough, the genre description “deliberately artificial romantic melodrama slash Thai western” don’t do justice to Wisit Sasanatieng’s 2000 film <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em>. The film is a postmodern pastiche of the most shallow and wonderful kind: ambitious, energetic, and entertaining, combining disparate clichés, both narrative and visual, to form something new and unique. </p>
<p>When the film opens, Dum (pronounced like Dahm, so it’s not really that funny) and Mahesuan, two gunmen dressed like parodies of cowboy tourists, assault a country house, shooting and killing everyone inside.  We learn that Dum, the eponymous Black Tiger, and Mahesuan are the right hand men of Fai, an outlaw whose band terrorizes the Thai countryside.  Meanwhile, a young woman, Rumpoey, waits in a lagoon gazebo for someone who never arrives; when she gazes at a photograph of the lover who has jilted her, we see it is Dum.  Dum arrives too late for their rendezvous, and Rumpoey returns home to be engaged to Kumjorn, a respectable and ambitious police captain. </p>

<p>Kumjorn, eager to prove himself, suggests to Rumpoey’s father, the governor, an attack on Fai and his men. The attack goes well for the police &#8212; that is, until Dum and Mahesuan return from a night of drunken revelry, in which they pledged blood brotherhood to each other. Kumjorn is captured, but Dum takes pity on him and lets him escape when he learns Kumjorn is betrothed to Rumpoey. Obviously, this sets in motion a love triangle between Dum, Kumjorn, and Rampoey, and sets Dum and Mahesuan against each other when Fai becomes suspicious of the infamous Black Tiger’s motives. </p>
<p>In classic melodramatic tradition, the plot is both deceptively simple and convoluted, as my description might suggest &#8212; and it leaves out the last third of the movie, as well as the flashback sequences where we learn how Dum and Rumpoey first met and fell in love. It trades in familiar narrative tropes and character types: the love triangle, romance between different social classes, the honorable outlaw, brothers (actual or figurative) set against one another by fate.  Complementing those well-tread narrative pathways, <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em> utilizes an expressive and inventive aesthetic cobbled together from past visual styles. The bright, saturated color schema and slight haze recalls the cheap color systems used in imitation of Technicolor by Indian and other Asian cinemas of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. The garish red of the blood reminds one of the thick splashes of Hammer horror films.  The musical leitmotif that follows the outlaw cowboys imitates Ennio Morricone’s Western themes, while the scenes between Dum and Rumpoey feature Max Steiner-like romantic swells.  </p>

<p>The purpose of this pastiche seems to be the deliberate interrogation of older styles and forms of filmmaking.  The artifice commonplace to classical filmmaking, but passé now &#8212; sets used for outdoor locations, over-emotive performances, rear projection driving &#8212; are not only used in <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em>, but made blindingly obvious to the viewer. The flashback to Dum and Rumpoey’s childhood even begins with a sequence that parodies silent film parodies, complete with overcranked projector speed, missing frames, and artificially induced dust and scratches. </p>
<p>A scene between Dum and Rumpoey as children offers a possible answer to the questions raised. At the gazebo where Rumpoey will later wait for him, only to be disappointed, Dum tells her a folktale about the builder of the gazebo. He was a woodcutter who fell in love with a wealthy girl, and built the structure as a monument to her beauty. When the girl’s father learned of her plan to run away and marry the woodcutter, he locked her away in their house, where she hanged herself in despair. Obviously the folktale is meant to resonate with the film’s main storyline of a socially unacceptable pairing and its potential for a tragic conclusion. I would offer, however, that this scene is key to understanding the film as a broader piece of work.  Its relationship to older models of filmmaking casts them as a kind of folktale storytelling, not meant to be naturalistic, but rather to conjure up modes of feeling and aesthetic appreciation unrelated to the quotidian modern. Those moments of artifice and of cinematic excess are clues to the viewer, telling us this is just a story, and just as the film echoes Dum’s folktale, attesting to its lessons, <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em> evokes the cinematic past to remind us of the truths embedded therein.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Shochiku studio released <em>The X From Outer Space</em> in 1967, they likely had high hopes for their own successful <em>kajiu eiga</em> (giant monster movie) series, much like Toho Studios’ famed <em>Godzilla</em> (1954), which by then already had seven profitable features.  Unfortunately for Shochiku, their monster Guilala failed to have the even modest success of Gamera, another of the giant monsters riding Godzilla’s spiky coattails.  For one thing, the tongue twister “Guilala” probably didn’t help.</p>
<p>Despite poor Guilala’s lack of popular appeal, the film that introduced him fascinates in its own right as an example of the craftsmanship of mid-century Japanese genre film.  An unscientific survey of comments on YouTube suggests that <em>The X From Outer Space</em> is considered a “so bad it’s good” style cult film, but I find it a good deal more interesting and well-made than many of the later Godzilla films, which are mostly repetitive, “monster of the year” wrestling matches between two men in rubber suits. To be fair, perhaps Guilala would have suffered the same fate as his compatriots Godzilla and Gamera, had <em>The X From Outer Space</em> succeeded.  After all, the first Godzilla film is probably the only masterpiece the <em>kajiu eiga</em> genre produced.  </p>
<p><em>The X From Outer Space</em> is only really a <em>kaiju eiga</em> in the second half of the film.  The first half of the film is a “voyage through space” narrative, similar to something like <em>Destination Moon</em> (1950) or <em>Rocketship X-M</em> (1950).  The crew of the AAB Gamma is dispatched to Mars to investigate the disappearance of previous expeditions, the cause of which, we are told “may be UFOs.”  The ship’s crew is diverse, made up of both Japanese and Americans, and they are directed from Earth by Dr. Berman and Dr. Kato.  In this respect, <em>The X From Outer Space</em> seems to emerge from the same Cold War liberal consensus as <em>Star Trek</em>, imagining space travel as a global, international venture undertaken for the benefit of humanity &#8212; though perhaps to attribute such sentiment to <em>The X From Outer Space</em> gives it the benefit of too much doubt.  </p>

<p>AAB Gamma experiences a fairly standard set of space travel film complications &#8212; a threatening UFO which resembles a glowing pastry, an ill crewmember who endangers the others, and a brief pit stop at the international moon station, which sets in motion a lamely conceived love triangle between Capt. Sano, ship’s scientist Lisa, and Michiko, a staff member at the moon station who holds a torch for the good captain.  The moon stop does provide a distraction for a kitsch-minded audience, however, as we get a full dose of the film’s mid-60s space age production design. </p>

<p>After replacing the ill crew member, the AAB Gamma blasts back into space, and once again encounters the UFO, which this time deposits a sticky, weblike substance onto the ship, attaching a glowing orb which, we later learn, is an egg containing Guilala.  The UFO has apparently mistaken the AAB Gamma for a mate.  The crew of the ship removes the glowing orb, for science, and naturally return it to Earth for study.  Predictably, the orb opens and Guilala escapes, grows to monstrous size at tremendous speed, and proceeds to attack power stations across Japan, feeding on the energy.  </p>
<p>At this point, the film becomes less interesting than during the “voyage through space” first half.  This is largely because the plot then follows the general formula of the kaiju eiga: Guilala threatens destroy a major urban area (as usual, Tokyo), the standard efforts of the military fail to cease his rampage, and the main characters stand around discussing said rampage until they discover a scientific way of destroying the monster.  The mise-en-scene feels familiar as well:  Guilala is clearly a man in a suit, smashing small model buildings, and matte shots allow the rubber terror to menace fleeing Japanese civilians.  Still, the entire thing is charmingly lo-fi, and demonstrates a level of special effects craftsmanship entirely lost in the digital age.  Perhaps my greater interest in the first half is a result of its leisurely pace and lack of urgency or clear direction, which enables a contemporary audience to appreciate the production design and effects.   </p>

<p>My objection to calling <em>The X From Outer Space</em> merely a laughable B-movie is that clear care was put into making the film, even if it aspires to be no more than a standard genre offering.  Consider the film’s repeated use of graphic matches.  Although it’s not entirely clear whether the filmmakers intend for us to make a comparison in using the device, its repetition seems a clear indicator of an aesthetic sensibility at work.  Finally, the soundtrack to the film is absolutely tremendous, featuring laidback, lounge-pop 60s music mixed with science fiction effects (sadly, no theremin, which fell out of popular use by this time), matching the film’s space-age optimism, though it does undercut the threat Guilala is supposed to represent.  To be fair, he was never that threatening anyway.  </p>
<p><em>The X From Outer Space</em> is dated as hell, and never once reaches the poetry of the original Godzilla (though few films do).  But it has enough idiosyncrasy to recommend it. I’ve read that a sequel was produced in 2008, but given the state of contemporary Japanese pop culture, I think I’ll skip it.  I prefer the charm of the 60s incarnation.      </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always loved watching TV. Yes, I said loved. I watch far too much and I blame my mother for that. She limited my TV watching when I was a kid. For a while growing up we didn’t even have a TV. (My babysitters were very bored after I went to bed.) I never watched <em>Sesame Street</em> or <em>Fraggle Rock</em>. At my father’s house the television screen was six inches. It wasn’t even a color TV. The only thing I remember watching on it was <em>Star Trek</em>. Once I got into middle school and high school I watched a bit more, but my mom was still there trying to curb my TV time. I would watch TV standing up with my hand on the cable box, ready to hit the power button and scurry off to start my chores the second I heard her car pull in the driveway. Obviously I had to make up for this lack of screen time in my childhood by watching an obscene amount of television (and movies on TV) once I hit adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite my devotion to television &#8212; you should see my cable bill &#8212; I still love books more. Lately I’ve been trying to figure out why. I think a big part of it is the freedom reading a book gives you. I don’t mean you can travel to new places or whatever the libraries of America try to convince you books can do. I mean that when I read a book I can picture the story unfolding in my head. And just because the author gives a main character blue eyes and fair skin doesn’t mean that’s how he looks to me. I can shorten him a little below the towering height a writer describes. I can ditch the blue eyes and give him brown ones like the boy I had a crush on in grade school. I can picture his smile and his mannerisms. With a movie you get what the casting director wants you to see.</p>
<p>With a book you can slow down and savor well-written passages. You can be surprised that an object mentioned in chapter one has a great deal of importance in the final pages because there wasn’t a slow dramatic camera pan to it. You can create your version of the world the author created.</p>
<p>This is not to say movies are bad or of lower quality than books. They&#8217;re an entirely different art form. And I do enjoy watching movies based on books I’ve enjoyed. To stop myself from fussing about all the differences I try to see the movie as a detailed summary of the book. Minor characters are often lost, plot points are condensed, motivations aren’t always fully explained. There’s nothing wrong with this, it’s just what makes the book better. I will always cry harder when a character dies in the book than in the movie.</p>
<p>Sometimes filmmakers try to capture the entire book. <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> was made into two movies. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> movies are all over three hours long. George R. R. Martin’s books are a television series on HBO and they still have to skip small details. I know making a book into a film can do wonders for the sales of that book. Finding out a movie I liked is a book often encourages me to read the book. What author wouldn’t love the boost in sales? </p>
<p>The notable exception to this rule is <em>American Psycho</em> (2000). The movie is fantastic, one of my favorites. A few years ago my husband bought the book, assuming that because he liked the movie so much he would enjoy it. I’ve been encouraging him to read more fiction so I proposed that we both read it for a little husband/wife book group. Neither of us made it past 60 pages. It’s awful. Obviously this is just my opinion, but I was shocked at the difference. I know one of the themes is consumerism and the movie touches that nicely. The book hits you over the head. I got tired of reading brand names somewhere around page five. It’s like half the text. And I felt like nothing was happening, the action was too slow, the characters too dull. </p>
<p>I wondered how this could be. Was I missing something? Was the novel better than the first read? I did a little investigating and I learned that Bret Easton Ellis, the author, wants to do a remake of the movie. Then I learned that Bret Easton Ellis is an idiot. He wants a shallow, rich, useless reality star to play Patrick Bateman, a role played impeccably by actor Christian Bale. First of all a remake would do nothing for this movie. <em>Total Recall</em> was remade with a different take on the story; <em>Star Trek</em> was set in an alternate reality. <em>American Psycho</em> was perfection in its first iteration; it needs no reboot. And you don’t need an insipid rich douche in real life to play one on the big screen. That’s the whole reason acting exists. A good actor can play a psychopath without actually being one. It’s actually amazing that Ellis didn’t ruin the movie. He didn’t write the screenplay and it shows. The director saw something in that book of his and polished it until it shown. </p>
<p>I’ve never fully understood that “exception proving the rule” phrase, but I think this nails it. Books and movies are each good in their own way and when they come together in capable hands magic can happen. I think it’s more often the case that a movie does a book a disservice – <em>The Golden Compass</em> movie was a wreck – than the other way around. Both are creative endeavors I will continue to enjoy, I’ll just always enjoys books a little more. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent video game film, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> (2012), has been called by some &#8220;the best video game movie ever made.&#8221; On the surface, that sounds like quite the endorsement, but if you dig deeper, such a title doesn&#8217;t carry much weight when you look at the rest of the sample in question.</p>
<p>In short, it is almost like calling <em>Rambo III</em> (1988) &#8220;the best Rambo-goes-to-Afghanistan movie ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s an exaggeration, but not far from the mark.</p>
<p>The original <em>Tron</em> (1982) is perhaps the only other video game film worthy of battling <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> for the title of &#8220;best video game ever,&#8221; because let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; most video game movies ain&#8217;t that good.</p>
<p>One would think, with plenty of captivating stories played out on home consoles every day, making a great video game movie would be easy. For some reason it is not.</p>
<p>Why? I don&#8217;t know, maybe, unlike <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, most video game films don&#8217;t embrace their video-gameness. <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not, which is the Achilles&#8217; heel of most video game films. <em>Resident Evil</em> (2002)? How do you screw up a special forces team fighting zombies in a spooky mansion?</p>
<p><em>Street Fighter</em> (1994)? That is worthy of its own article. Man, I waited <em>in line</em> on opening night to see that turkey.</p>
<p>And then there is the gold standard of failed video game films: <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (1993).</p>
<p>I confess to <strong>a)</strong> seeing <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in the theater on opening weekend and <strong>b)</strong> owning the DVD.</p>
<p>Yes, years later, as an adult, I made the conscious decision to own the film.</p>
<p>Is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8220;good&#8221;? That depends on what one considers good. Story-wise, no, not really. It&#8217;s just strange. Entertainment-wise, yes, because it is so ridiculous. Get some beers, call over your friends, and put on <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8212; there is no way you don&#8217;t enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Plus, Mojo Nixon <a title="video on youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4_nFgY7PZA">has a cameo</a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4_nFgY7PZA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Why is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <b>so</b> strange? Because it didn&#8217;t embrace its video-gameness. The film tries to explain the <em>hows</em> and <em>whys</em> of the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> universe, which is its biggest mistake &#8212; but it is also the reason why it is so hilarious.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the film in a vacuum. If the screenwriters were told &#8220;try to explain how this universe with King Koopa and mushroom people could really happen,&#8221; they made quite the effort. An asteroid knocking dinosaurs into a parallel dimension, where they evolved into humanoids? OK.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great for an episode of <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Sliders</em>, but it doesn&#8217;t really belong in a movie about <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need realistic explanations for plumbers growing into giants or shooting fireballs at angry turtles as they try to save a princess. People accept <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> for what it is: <b>fantasy</b>.</p>
<p>And this is how <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> earned its many praises: it ups the fantasy and doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not. There isn&#8217;t any screen time devoted to <i>why</i> the video game characters are &#8220;alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>They just <i>are</i>, and that is good enough for me.</p>
<p>But, on some level, I am glad <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> tried to be as serious as it is &#8212; otherwise, I may not have one of my favorite bad movies to watch with friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eddie Murphy has made plenty of odd films. But, at least his odd film of the 1980s was odd in an interesting way, not because he wore a fat suit.</p>
<p><a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305310351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=6305310351&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>The Golden Child</em></a> (1986) is odd, because it blends action, comedy, fantasy, and elements of Chinese mysticism.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Yes, <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUCQX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QUCQX8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>Big Trouble in Little China</em></a> has all of those things too (and they came out the same year).</p>
<p>But, only one of these films has Eddie Murphy, and that is the big difference (even though Kurt Russel is great in <em>Big Trouble</em>). I have read <em>The Golden Child</em> was <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Child#Production_details">originally planned</a> as a very serious adventure film, but when Murphy was brought on, it switched gears.</p>
<p>So, now you have Eddie Murphy fighting demons, traveling to Tibet, and searching for magical weapons.</p>
<p>Ah, the 1980s. What an era for film.</p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s humor and comedic timing help balance the mystical elements of the film. Had this film taken itself more seriously, I doubt it would have been nearly as enjoyable. Just when the story gets really deep into the mystical side, there&#8217;s Murphy with a joke, or a goofy expression to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>When you have a story with a demon in human form trying to feed a supernatural child blood to weaken his powers, you need a few jokes here and there. It helps keep the dark, occult themes (of which there are many) from overpowering the story.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some &#8220;whatever&#8221; moments, such as when Murphy has to carry a glass of water through an obstacle course without spilling a drop. And, why is a social worker The Chosen One who can save The Child?</p>
<p>But who cares? There is also a dragon lady. And let us not forget the classic, “I want the knife” scene.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr0JXSM_0Nk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I have probably watched this film, in part or in whole, about a hundred times. It was a fixture on TV in my youth. It was almost always on at any given point, especially the weekends. Sure, it is an odd film, but it has a bit charm, thanks to Eddie Murphy in his prime. This was just after <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>, when he could do no wrong.</p>
<p>Some might disagree, and say <em>The Golden Child</em> was Murphy&#8217;s only stumble during his string of hits in the 1980s. Compared to his other films of the eighties, <em>The Golden Child</em> sticks out like a sore thumb, but only due to its plot. In terms of box office, the film was a success (although, I have read, not in the eyes of the studio).</p>
<p>And as someone who grew up in the 1980s, <em>The Golden Child</em> was a success in keeping me entertained. Over and over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born into a major Hollywood family, a lot of Sofia Coppola’s career has been critiqued as a product of nepotism. After all, it can’t be too hard to break into the movie biz when Francis Ford Coppola is your daddy.  I’m not one of her haters though. Beyond her elegant and heart-wrenching screenwriting, her directorial portrayals of femininity as both fragile and fierce, I’m pulled to this Coppola’s strength of aesthetics. There’s just something about Sofia. </p>
<p>Movies like <em>Lost in Translation</em> (2003), <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> (1999), and <em>Marie Antionette</em> (2006) possess a mesmerizing visual power as Coppola creates moods with meticulous settings, washes of color, and scenes framed to capture both the agony and the ecstasy of any given moment.  I love how she is invested in the bittersweet and how she uses style to express the affective register of her films.  </p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that her personal style is likewise consistent, nuanced, and impeccable. Coppola’s closet is marked by a heavy rotation of classy basics. She doesn’t dip into every trend, though you will see her don an artsy piece of modern construction or fresh cut for formal events. In general, her look is cool, chic, laid-back, easy, but definitely put-together. Her take on feminine is simple with a few soft flourishes like a 70’s style tie-neck blouse, or a sweet yet polished Peter Pan collar. When capturing her look, aim for well fitted pants that skim curves, but not too tightly. Dark-wash bootcut or slightly flared trouser jeans maintain a balance between casual comfort and strong lines that can take you just about anywhere. Though you’ll see her in simple or artsy pumps, the ease of her look is best expressed with classic flats. Think minimal fuss, but with a bit of interest &#8212; a metallic bow detail or some other clean, modern extra, but nothing too heavily patterned or garrish. Coppola acheives her just-threw-this-on appeal with garments that aren’t overtly sexy, or girly. Fit for her is loose, but not sloppy and a structured bag and well-cut coat temper the flowy lines of the rest of her outfit. </p>
<p>When taking a cue from Sofia, less is more. Find comfortable pieces that aren’t overtly feminine, but are soft and easy. Focus on fit and play up unexpected palettes and details. This style icon is not about blaring statements, but thoughtful assemblages that create a feel, an air, a subtle and tasteful impression.</p>

Crazy in an entertaining way no less (at least to me).</p>
<p>In <em>Hard Target</em> you have a movie with mid-prime Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lance Henriksen (who always excels at crazy), the guy who played the Mummy in <a title="Names escape me." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JQB5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00000JQB5&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>The Mummy</em></a>, and Wilfred Brimley as a Cajun moonshiner. Add strange guns, motorcycles, Van Damme&#8217;s martial arts, John Woo&#8217;s over-the-top style, and you have a highly entertaining 97 minutes of celluloid.</p>
<p>Did I mention at one point Van Damme fires a pistol while holding it upside down?</p>
<p>Oh man, does he ever. I don&#8217;t mean twisting his arm around either, I mean holding the gun like he doesn&#8217;t know which end is up. It is brilliant in its absurdity &#8212; and I love it.</p>
<p>In Woo&#8217;s oeuvre, <em>Hard Target</em> comes right after <a title="Watch it. WATCH IT" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N4SHNK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000N4SHNK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>Hard Boiled</em></a> (1992) &#8212; a film every action fan must watch (and subtitled, not dubbed). If you watch <em>Hard Boiled</em> and <em>Hard Target</em> back to back (and why not?) you will notice a few things: John Woo loves guys firing automatic weapons atop motorcycles, and doves. Yes, doves. One even leads Van Damme to a clue.</p>
<p>An aside: Woo&#8217;s <a title="Classic." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036BDQBU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0036BDQBU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>The Killer</em></a> (1989) is another must watch.</p>
<p>Back to <em>Hard Target</em>: Jean-Claude Van Damme&#8217;s hair. Oh. My. Goodness. It is a sight to behold. His mullet is the stuff of legends, so much that I immediately thought of it while <a title="Comic!" href="http://clattertron.com/2012/09/10/mullets/" target="_blank">drawing a comic about mullets</a>.</p>
<p>And let us not forget Mr. Oatmeal himself, Wilfred Brimley. In his finest work since <em>Ewoks: The Battle for Endor</em>, Brimley plays Van Damme&#8217;s recluse, moonshiner uncle. With a Cajun accent no less. It is glorious.</p>
<p>The only thing more glorious is when Van Damme punches a snake and [spoiler alert] bites off its rattle. It is a jaw dropping moment, and I could watch the scene on repeat all day.</p>
<p>Has Woo made better movies? Yes, of course (again, see: <em>The Killer</em> and <em>Hard Boiled</em>). Is <em>Hard Target</em> perfect? Absolutely not. But, does that matter? No. <em>Hard Target</em> is fun &#8212; and it is a great time capsule of early 1990s action films.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The range of my taste in film covers a wide area. </p>
<p>If my tastes were represented by a country&#8217;s land area, it would be Russia. Despite my fiancée&#8217;s insistence that I don&#8217;t like any film made after 2000 &#8212; mainly because I had not watched <em>Superbad</em> until last week &#8212; I enjoy many different films. My film collection would suggest as much, which ranges from Oscar winning classics of the 1960s to b-movies of the 1980s, and many more. </p>
<p>One film that holds a place of honor on my shelf is the Bruce Willis vehicle, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/" target="_blank">Hudson Hawk</a></em> (1991). It is absurd, ridiculous, and preposterous. </p>
<p>And I love every damn frame. I love the film so much, I even referenced it in <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/13/microsoft-outlook/" target="_blank">one of my comic strips</a>. </p>
<p>I have a soft-spot for absurd action-comedies, and Hudson Hawk is more or less my gold standard. It is also on the short list of films I have purchased in two or more formats: first VHS, and then DVD (<em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, and <em>Army of Darkness</em> being the others. <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> will join that list eventually. <em>Gremlins</em>, however, is the reigning champ: VHS, DVD, and Laserdisc—in that order).</p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> is a love it or hate it film. </p>
<p>Folks I know who love the film, love it to pieces and quote it often (the film is incredibly quotable: “You took down Captain Bob&#8217;s steering wheel?!”, “Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!”, “Hey Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.”). </p>
<p>But, for those who can&#8217;t embrace the absurdity, <em>Hudson Hawk</em> is the worst thing put to celluloid this side of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero" target="_blank">Last Action Hero</a></em> (the subject of a future article). </p>
<p>Is <em>Hudson Hawk</em> a perfect film? Hardly.</p>
<p>But, it is entertaining and hilarious (keep in mind this comes from a guy who draws comics rife with <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/06/schmoopy/" target="_blank">absurd humor</a>). It is full of gags I love to death. The scene where the Pope is watching Mr. Ed dubbed into Italian gets me every time. Another favorite (and speaking as someone who is half-Italian) is when an Italian guard pours spaghetti, with sauce, out of a Thermos.</p>
<p>Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello, to me, form an impressive comedic duo. I love their snappy dialogue and banter. They have chemistry, and they come across as real pals. If you go into <em>Hudson Hawk</em> expecting a <em>Die Hard</em>, you will be incredibly disappointed (although the same could probably be said of <em>Die Hard 2</em>). Yet, if you approach <em>Hudson Hawk</em> as a poor man&#8217;s <em>Ghostbusters</em> or <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>, it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>Maybe. I don&#8217;t make any promises.</p>
<p>If you can find the DVD, give the director commentary by Michael Lehmann a listen. It is as entertaining as it is informative, and I love Lehmann&#8217;s refrain of “Did I mention this film did well in Europe?” after some of the gags. He also explains several scenes which were cut from the film, including a sub-plot about Willis getting revenge for the death of his monkey sidekick, Little Eddie (YES). </p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> isn&#8217;t perfect, and it isn&#8217;t for everyone, but for those, like myself, who enjoy absurdity, it is 100 minutes well spent. </p>
<p>And it is way funnier than <em>Die Hard 2</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me.</em></p>
<p>&#8212; Christopher Nolan</p></blockquote>
<p>I saw <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> approximately 24 hours after the tragedy that occurred in Aurora, Colorado. I didn’t think twice when I purchased the tickets, even though I had heard about it all the way to work that Friday morning. It wasn’t until a security guard entered the theatre right after the house lights had dimmed and checked the emergency exits that I found my eyes and mind wandering. I scanned those same exits. I looked at the folks around me, especially those who had gotten up to leave. Returning with no concessions or evidence of purpose only sent my imagination off. I had to decide whether or not person X was likely to commit a violent act. Surely that old man here with his wife wouldn’t brandish a weapon? That group of guys? That mother of three?</p>
<p>Part of me was embarrassed that any of it had even crossed my mind. Aurora&#8217;s Cinema 16 security was not prepared for such a random act of violence precisely because it was unthinkable. To my knowledge, nothing like it had ever happened before. The last time I can recall any violence linked to a movie screening was in the early 90’s after the release of <em>New Jack City</em>. I confess to being ignorant as to whether or not any gun violence actually took place (mostly fights, if memory serves), but I feel confident in saying that no one was shot IN a theatre, and certainly not over 50 people. But yes, it has happened now and we tell ourselves we must do something so it can never happen again.</p>
<p>But we do not live in the world of <em>Minority Report</em>. We can&#8217;t predict individual acts of violence. We can only <em>react</em>. There isn’t a place we can go that will be completely and absolutely safe, but there are places where violence is far less likely to occur. The movie theatre should be one of them. I believe that it still is.</p>
<p>Time will tell, of course. This appears, so far, to have been the act of a lone and probably unbalanced individual. There will always be crazies. There will always be acts of random violence in public places. Are we to live in fear? Are we to walk out of our front doors every day expecting the worst? Of course not. But we feel the need to react. There must be something, anything that can be done.</p>
<p>I must admit to being pleased that the result hasn&#8217;t been a return to the argument that the film itself was responsible for inciting violence. We know that to be at best a gross oversimplification. Films themselves are reactions to the human experience. They hold up a mirror. It may be wiser to look at America’s appetite for violence. Violent films are made because they make money. A violent culture, or at least a culture with a taste for consuming violent images, leads to violent films, not the other way around.</p>
<p>There were more than a few scenes in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> that made my wife shield her eyes, all involving guns. I looked for her reaction because I was affected as well. But I did settle a bit as the film continued. I cannot pinpoint when, specifically, but I know that I eventually did what I had come to do &#8212; I watched a movie. And though the Aurora tragedy never fully left my mind, I was able to push it into the background. My hope is that in the future other moviegoers will be able to do the same, their fear dimming with the theatre lights, not forgotten, but not triumphant either.</p>
