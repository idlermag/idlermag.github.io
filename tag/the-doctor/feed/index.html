										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly fifty years and eleven actors, we have some idea of what makes the Doctor: <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">&#8220;He’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s a bit distant, and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">&#8220;he has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s dangerous &#8212; when the Doctor is around, people die &#8212; but he&#8217;s irresistible, and, in the David Tennant incarnation at least, he&#8217;s a walking broken heart. He&#8217;s the one who has to make all the impossible choices and save the world, even though he may not be able to save you.</p>
<p>After Christopher Eccleston spent a year breathing new life into the Doctor Who francise, and sacrificed himself to save pop singer Billie Piper (a.k.a. Rose Tyler) from a case of terminal omnipotence, David Tennant stepped into the Doctor&#8217;s trainers and travelling coat for a four-year, three-season run as the Tenth and best Doctor. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s run actually starts off a bit slowly, not entirely hitting its stride until halfway through #10&#8217;s second year (and second companion).</p>
<p>In &#8220;Human Nature/The Family of Blood,&#8221; the Doctor and companion Martha Jones hide out in early twentieth century England from a family of intergalactic hunters. In order to keep the family from tracking them, the Doctor has to alter his physiology to become human, and hide his memories and identity in a pocket watch. (It&#8217;s <em>Doctor Who</em>. Believe it or not, it all makes sense in the episode. Mostly.) The family is relentless, but they&#8217;re short-lived, so if the Doctor and Martha can hide for a few months, they&#8217;ll be safe.</p>
<p>While they&#8217;re hiding, however, the Doctor has no idea that he&#8217;s been anything other than John Smith, schoolteacher at a boys&#8217; boarding school. To make things worse, he&#8217;s fallen in love with the school nurse, Joan Redfern. In order to become the Doctor again, John Smith has to give up his existence. In effect, he has to die for the Doctor to live, and since the Family of Blood has found him, the Doctor has to live in order to be able to save the people John Smith loves.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4wziEiE3Vc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>It is, interestingly, a story in which the Doctor is almost entirely absent, even when David Tennant is onscreen, and when the Doctor returns, his return is terrible.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SC0NuBaliLs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>After this episode, David Tennant&#8217;s Doctor is constantly on the edge of not being the Doctor anymore. After defeating fellow Time Lord The Master (the brilliant, manic John Simm) in &#8220;The Last of the Time Lords,&#8221; the Doctor nearly gives up his itinerant existence in order to care for (and imprison) the one being who could actually be a full and equal companion. In &#8220;The Waters of Mars,&#8221; the Doctor abandons Time Lord constraints and attempts to intervene in a fixed point in history &#8212; avert a tragedy without which the human race might never have set out to explore the universe. In &#8220;Journey&#8217;s End,&#8221; the Doctor prevents a full regeneration (and the same sort of identity death that John Smith faced) by shunting his regeneration energy into the creation of a full second self, who isn&#8217;t a Time Lord, isn&#8217;t immortal, and, not coincidentally, end up getting to lead exactly the sort of life the Doctor wishes that he could have, sharing a single lifetime with an equal partner, instead of an eternal series of temporary companions.</p>
<p>Whatever he does, the Tenth Doctor is never able to escape the costs of his actions, and indeed, his very existence. He is always apologizing to the people he cannot save, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQkFNVhppXo" target="_blank">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In some sense, judging whether the Tenth Doctor is the best Doctor isn&#8217;t an entirely fair competition, since, rather unusually for a new Doctor, Tennant inherits a lot of the strongest elements of Eccleston&#8217;s (and Russell T. Davies&#8217;) modern <em>Doctor Who</em> relaunch. <em>Doctor Who</em> isn&#8217;t really known for continuity &#8212; in fact, each regeneration is normally treated as an entirely fresh start &#8212; but the Tenth Doctor benefits from the show&#8217;s willingness to reach back to previous companions and previous Doctors, and to continue to build on the relationships the Tenth Doctor creates. Companions depart and return &#8212; Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, and even Sarah Jane Smith, who traveled with the Third and Fourth Doctors. Every departure is heartbreaking. Every return comes at a cost, and leads both to triumph and further heartbreak.</p>
<p>For all that, in all honesty, I&#8217;m a bit surprised to not find myself fonder of Matt Smith&#8217;s Eleventh Doctor. The current head writer, Steven Moffat is responsible for many of the very best episodes of both the Ninth and Tenth Doctors&#8217; runs, including &#8220;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances,&#8221; the Christopher Eccleston episodes that finally made me a full-on rabid fan of the Doctor, and my absolute favorite episode, &#8220;Blink,&#8221; which really should totally devastate my argument since David Tennant is barely in it.</p>
<p>But the Eleventh Doctor&#8217;s episodes are somehow shallower. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s playfulness with language (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GMkWfpj4s" target="_blank">&#8220;Allons-y! I should say allons-y more often. Allons-y. Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!&#8221;</a>) is transformed into a penchant for silly hats. (I&#8217;ll give you the fez, Matt Smith, but the stetson/bow tie combination is not cool.) Even worse, Moffat somehow steps on his own best ideas. The Weeping Angels, so frightening and unique in &#8220;Blink,&#8221; (&#8220;The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death.&#8221;) are transformed into brutes that just snap your neck.</p>
<p>I will look forward to the new season, especially if it gives Matt Smith a chance to figure out who his Doctor is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/21/showbiz/tv/doctor-who-new-companion-ew/index.html" target="_blank">without Amy Pond</a>. No Doctor who hasn&#8217;t lost a companion is <em>really</em> the Doctor, and that, ultimately, is why the Tenth Doctor has to stand above Nine and Eleven.</p>

Fezzes are cool.</p></div> My esteemed college and, more importantly, fellow Sarah, has asserted <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor is the best Doctor</a>. While in every subjective way her opinion is well reasoned and valid, in every objective way her opinion is obviously ill-informed and invalid. Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor is the best of the modern Doctors. </p>
<p>My personal <em>Doctor Who</em> trajectory had me starting, like Sarah, with Nine and I&#8217;d also consider it blasphemy to skip him and go to Ten. But while I watched the modern series as it premiered, I also simultaneously watched some of the classic series thanks to the magic of Netflix. I&#8217;d jump from the grumpy First Doctor to the <em>joie de vivre</em> of the Ninth Doctor, then back to the flamboyant Fourth Doctor, then to the manic Tenth Doctor. The result being I never really imprinted on one particular Doctor or developed a certain expectation for the show. </p>
<p>For me, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether Eleven is the truest incarnation of earlier versions of The Doctor (he is) or whether he&#8217;s the most interesting portrayal of The Doctor (he is) or whether Matt Smith is just the most handsome of the three modern Doctors (oh, yes, he is). What matters is that Eleven is the most believable character. </p>
<p>All my problems with the Tenth Doctor and Russell T. Davies crystallized in the character&#8217;s finale where Ten has to decide whether to give his life for a human, an elderly man he had no particular connection to or affection for. Not the love of his life, not the president, not a child destined for greatness. Just a run-of-the-mill old guy who by his own admission will probably die in a couple years anyhow. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHMBxYXmrTw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>Look at you, not remotely important. But me, I could do so much more!</p></blockquote>
<p>I hate most vampires because they&#8217;re unrealistic, and I don&#8217;t mean the blood sucking part. If you are a thousand-year-old nearly invincible creature, why are you spending your time and energy becoming super BFFs with humans? </p>
<p>I mean, I have a cat. I love my cat. I&#8217;m going to outlive it and be sad when it dies. I&#8217;ll probably get a new cat after that. But no matter how much I love my cat, I&#8217;m not going to give my life for it or pretend my cat or cats in general have any sort of meaningful impact on my life or the world. In what functional way are humans different than cats when it comes to other worldly immortal beings? </p>
<p>Now in the Doctor&#8217;s case, sure, he&#8217;s the last of his kind so he&#8217;s going to get bored and lonely and want to befriend other creatures. I get why Ten finds humanity interesting and wants to hang out with humans. What I don&#8217;t understand is why Ten gets all weepy and martyrs himself for one lousy human. You&#8217;d never see Eleven (or any other Doctor (or any other ancient, nearly invincible being)) giving his life in such a meaningless bargain. He cares more about puzzles than people. </p>
<p>Eleven doesn&#8217;t give a shit. He&#8217;ll promise a kid he&#8217;ll be right back then take another ten or fifteen years to get around to it. Does he care about what he put that kid through? Eh, not really. He has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely. Hanging out with humans is a means to an end: fun. </p>
<p>Taken in isolation as a character, Eleven is unequivocally my favorite but when you start looking at plot, companions, and how it&#8217;s written generally then things get murkier. </p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_9355" style="width: 230px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9355" data-attachment-id="9355" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/amypond/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/amypond.jpg" data-orig-size="440,600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="amypond" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/amypond.jpg?w=220" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/amypond.jpg?w=440" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/amypond.jpg?w=220&#038;h=300" alt="Amy Pond" title="amypond" width="220" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-9355" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/amypond.jpg?w=220&amp;h=300 220w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/amypond.jpg?w=110&amp;h=150 110w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/amypond.jpg 440w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9355" class="wp-caption-text">She's frequently referred to as &quot;the girl who waited.&quot; How's that for agency?</p></div> Whereas Russell T. Davies tugs at your heart with dramatic emotional plots, Stephen Moffat tugs at your brain with complex intellectual plots. Eleven’s aloofness pairs well with Moffat’s cerebral writing. </p>
<p>When it comes to companions, I don&#8217;t love any of them, and Amy least of all. Her lack of agency in the show is disturbing. (I was really pregnant and in a vat the whole time!) Unfortunately what I love about the character of Eleven, I hate about the writer: Stephen Moffat is extremely misogynistic. From <em>Coupling</em> to <em>Sherlock</em> to <em>Doctor Who</em>, all his leads are characterized by a borderline pathological disregard for women. I still enjoy his shows but it&#8217;s not always easy. </p>
<p>As a show with decades of history and hundreds of people working on it, the quality of the episodes vary wildly. It&#8217;s almost impossible to be a fan of the show and love all of it. Of my DWho friends, I&#8217;m probably the most critical of the show. From the cheesy to the nonsensical to the overblown, for every one episode I love there&#8217;s probably two I hate. But the highs are high and they keep me coming back for more. </p>
<p>Because when you start in on <em>Doctor Who</em> you have to watch it for better or worse, in cheesiness and in earnestness, as long as you both shall endure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I finally decided to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em>. I’m not sure why I hadn’t before. I think it always seemed too hardcore. Everyone I knew who watched the show was constantly making in-jokes with other Who fans. (One indication of how out of it I am: are fans of the show Who fans or Doctor fans?) This is in part because when I was growing up, and indeed up though most of my college years, the show was still on the air. And the folks I knew who watched it? They didn’t just watch the current seasons. No, they went back and watched all the seasons from its start in 1963. (Come to think of it, what did they do before VCRs became readily available? That scarcity might go a long way in explaining the fanaticism of my friends. You have to be hardcore to watch a show in its infancy when it’s not available on streaming, or DVD, or video. You’d have to bond with other people searching out the series instead of sticking with the more readily available <em>Dallas</em> or <em>M*A*S*H*</em>.) (It’s not that I wasn’t a science fiction fan—I have treasured memories of watching <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Star_Trek/70136140" target="_blank">Star Trek</a></em> with my mom, even though that series had stopped, so clearly syndication was available, even back in the dark days of my childhood. But somehow <em>Doctor Who</em> wasn’t part of our picture.)</p>
<p>If I can’t quite explain why I hadn’t watched it before, neither can I explain why I decided to start watching it last year. I suspect that somehow I stumbled across it streaming on Netflix, had nothing else to do, and thought, why not? It might have been after <em>Sherlock</em> was over and I was desperate for something British to watch. I’m not sure. But in any case, the show was baffling and inexplicable and I couldn’t stop watching.</p>

Yes, I laugh knowingly at Dalek jokes, but those are just funny. But a conversation on twitter recently made me realize that I might have my own obsessive corner after all. A tweep announced that he was going to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em> and asked for advice on where to begin—the most recent season? Or back to David Tennant? The consensus, much to my horror, was to begin with David Tennant, aka the Tenth Doctor, who took over the role in the final episode of the return of the series in 2005. I certainly don’t want to cast aspersions on Tennant’s Doctor &#8212; he seems a lovely fellow and all. But the right answer to this question is to start at the beginning of the revived series in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, aka the Best Doctor.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to start the series with the Best Doctor. And I’ll confess that I’m only halfway through the 3<sup>rd</sup> new series (aka the 2007 season), so perhaps Tennant will grow on me, or I’ll discover that Matt Smith, the Eleventh Doctor, is the best of them all. But I doubt it. I think Eccleston has imprinted on me and he’ll be what I always want the Doctor to be. Here’s what I love about him: he’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side (whoops, a bit of childhood <em>Star Wars</em> in there) and becoming too destructive. I suppose that seems like it might reveal more about me than about the show, but I’m not really that much into dangerous men. (Ok, given <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/" target="_blank">my previous attestations of love for Paul Newman</a>, that might not be entirely true, though I will stand by my position that his dangerous persona goes hand-in-hand with his real-life loving-husband, do-gooder one.)</p>
<p>What makes Eccleston work in ways that Tennant doesn’t is that he gives the Doctor an edge. Without that edge, it’s too easily just a series of romps through time with someone who is all-powerful and yet has a tragic history. With Eccleston’s manic danger (a trait that he brings to many of his roles, but that here is balanced with some joy and goodness), you get a sense that there’s something at stake in the Doctor’s adventures. Is he going to destroy the world or save it? There’s no fun in the hero always being the hero. It’s the tension between saving and failing that makes a story compelling. Maybe Tennant comes to that later on, but in his first seasons, he doesn’t hold a candle to Eccleston.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em>, currently streaming seasons 1 through 6 of the new series: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441" target="_blank">http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441</a></p>
<p>Some earlier episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> seem to be streaming on Netflix, too, but honestly, the search interface is such a nightmare that I can’t figure out what order the shows go in, so you’re on your own for finding those. Sorry. I recommend you search on <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/" target="_blank">the Instant Watch Database</a> to see what’s what. If <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/search/main?search=1&amp;searchPage=1&amp;previousTextSearch=&amp;previousSubGenre=0&amp;textSearch=Doctor%20Who&amp;textSearchType=all&amp;genre=0&amp;availability=&amp;rating=&amp;quality=&amp;startYear=1914&amp;endYear=2012&amp;Submit=Instant%20Watch%20Search!" target="_blank">this link</a> hasn’t degraded, it will take you to a nice page with the available episodes listed in order. Good luck!</p>
