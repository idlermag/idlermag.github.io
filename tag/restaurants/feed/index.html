										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everywhere I go, I&#8217;m finding macaroni and cheese. Family restaurants like Max and Erma&#8217;s have added it to the menu. For a while, Burger King was offering Kraft mac &amp; cheese as an option in its kid&#8217;s meals. It&#8217;s become the go-to when my wife and I take the girls out to dinner, and it&#8217;s my older daughter&#8217;s all-time favorite food. Everybody&#8217;s happy, everybody wins, right?</p>
<p>This past weekend, the family and I had dinner with my sister-in-law and her husband at a &#8220;bar and grille&#8221; in Madison, New Jersey. Any place the adds an &#8220;e&#8221; to the word grill clearly takes its menu seriously, and one of the entrees was an &#8220;adult&#8221; mac and cheese. While &#8220;a luscious aged cheddar and American cheese blend, baked with a scallion breadcrumb crust and a touch of brandy&#8221; sounded tempting to me, my daughter &#8212; the m&amp;c expert &#8212; doesn&#8217;t like her mac and cheese to be too fussy. Mushrooms? Onions? A Ritz cracker crust? She&#8217;s out. The kid&#8217;s menu included &#8220;mac&#8217;n cheese&#8221; without any additional description, so we crossed our fingers when both the girls ordered it.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, when the kid&#8217;s &#8220;mac&#8217;n cheese&#8221; arrived, it was a bunch of elbow noodles swimming in Velveeta. The girls wouldn&#8217;t touch it. I was severely annoyed and just a little proud. (They ended up sharing my burger, which looked like it was good.)</p>
<p>So last night, to make up for it, we made a batch of our own mac and cheese at home. It&#8217;s pretty basic, but worth sharing as an alternative to the standard boxed version. Not that the salty, tangy, powdered cheese substitute variety doesn&#8217;t have its appeal, but just a little bit of effort can give you noodles swimming in a gorgeous, golden, sharp cheddar sauce.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by melting the butter over low heat, and then add the flour. It&#8217;ll start off looking like this:</p>

<p>And as the magic happens, it&#8217;ll start looking like this:</p>

<p>As many of you know, what you&#8217;re doing is making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux" target="_blank">roux</a>, where the flour particles form an emulsion in the butter fat and act as the base for your eventual cheese sauce. As anyone who has watched a Velveeta commercial knows, while cheddar tastes awesome, when it melts it gets kind of oily. Thus the sauce rather than just melting a block of cheddar over the noodles. (Which would actually taste fine, if you don&#8217;t mind the oil.)</p>
<p>(If you want to stretch a little bit, you can continue to heat the roux a minute or two before moving on to the next step. It&#8217;ll toast the flour, giving you a darker roux and a slightly nutty flavor to your final mac and cheese.)</p>
<p>Add the milk and salt to your roux, and melt the cheese into the sauce, adding a little at a time. Pro tip: those packages of pre-shredded cheese you can find in the supermarket are generally exactly two cups (8 ounces). If you&#8217;re like me and pull the package straight from the freezer, you can raise the heat to medium. Stir until all the cheese has melted. It&#8217;ll be a golden pot of cheesy awesomeness to make Velveeta curl up with envy, and it&#8217;ll look something like this:</p>

<p>Boil the noodles while you&#8217;re making the sauce. When both are done, stir together in an oven-safe casserole dish. When we&#8217;re in a hurry, we&#8217;ll serve the mac and cheese just like this.</p>

<p>The girls have never complained, but I&#8217;m much happier when we throw the mixture into a 350-degree oven for 20-25 minutes, and it comes out looking something like this:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7973" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/12/05/mac-and-cheese/100_0808/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg" data-orig-size="4000,3000" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M341 Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1323024730&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;80&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="100_0808" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="baked mac" title="100_0808" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7973" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=960 1280w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/100_0808.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Most of the &#8220;adult&#8221; restaurant mac and cheeses you&#8217;ll find will have some sort of a breadcrumb crust, which is wonderful, but even just the cheese sauce by itself will give you a nice, tasty crust after baking. (If you prefer a creamier mac and cheese, you can double the milk in the sauce to two cups.)</p>
<p>And now you&#8217;re ready to experiment! Mushrooms! Jalepeños! More cheese! But even without all that, you have a wonderful, rich, cheesy macaroni and cheese. Even better, so long as you&#8217;re not feeding a group, you&#8217;ll have leftovers waiting for you any time need a warm plate of comfort food.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As most of you already know, I’m getting ready to move from Boston to San Francisco. I’ve never even been there, so I went a few days early to see the apartment and, more importantly, to eat some food. Charlie’s only been there for a month or so, but he’s already done an A-plus job of scoping out some good eats, both in downtown San Francisco and in San Mateo, where he lives.</p>

<p>On Saturday, we met up with two of our friends who were also visiting San Francisco for dinner. Charlie and I tried to make reservations for <a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com/" target="new">The Slanted Door</a>, a spot on the bay, looking out at the Bay Bridge with lots of vegetarian options for our friends. But tragedy struck early, and there were no reservations for Saturday night. Because I’m a planner and feel irrationally responsible for when things go wrong, I started to panic.</p>
<p>We walked all the way down Market Street amid lots of rainbow flags and scantily clad men and women, which only increased my anxiety because they were all having so much fun and I wanted to have a fun dinner and what if we couldn’t get a table? Neither Charlie nor I had any idea of where else to go, being newbies in the city.</p>
<p>We got to the restaurant and found out that we had to wait until 5:30, and then we could <em>speak to the concierge</em> and see if there were any tables available. I worried immediately that we weren’t dressed fancy enough. But we weren’t going to let our plans be foiled, so we hung around the pier until five, and got in line. We were third from the front. I stood with my elbows out to keep anyone from cutting. Our friends joined us right before 5:30, and, when we said “Four please,” as cool as can be, they showed us right to a table. I’d like to thank my new hipster glasses and my friend Nicole’s fancy shoes for our street cred.</p>

<p>The food was Vietnamese with all sorts of interesting ingredients, like mint and peanut butter. It was served family-style, so we each got several dishes and shared. Everything was incredible, although I didn’t like having to cut the heads off the shrimp, which I guess were actually prawns. As it turned out, The Slanted Door is sort of a thing.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the boys were whispering and discreetly pointing. “What?” I asked, and started to turn around. “<em>Don’t</em>,” they both hissed. Apparently, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001287/">Heather Graham</a> was sitting behind us being extremely friendly with the man next to her. I’m proud to say that we got nowhere near as giddy as the men did, but we’d definitely chosen a legit restaurant, especially when I went to the bathroom and an attendant wiped the seat off and opened the door for me. Opening doors has always been something I struggle with.</p>
<p>The next day, Charlie took me to lunch at an Indian place in downtown San Mateo called <a href="http://www.curryupnow.com/" target="new">CurryUpNow</a> (cute, right?). They used to operate out of carts but became so popular that they opened up a restaurant.</p>

<p>Charlie was raving about their tikka masala burritos, so I ordered a chicken one, no onions. My choices were regular, spicy, and extra spicy. Charlie ordered spicy, and I like spicy food, so I didn’t want to be shown up. I ordered spicy too.</p>

<p>A few bites in, and I was sweating. How could anyone ever sit out in the hot sun and eat this from a cart? I was having trouble sitting down and eating it. I once had a burrito in London, of all places, that was so spicy it brought tears to my eyes. This was spicier. I had to keep getting up to get more napkins to dab at my forehead and upper lip, and to blow my nose. If you are sick and need to clear out your sinuses, I recommend some spicy tikka masala.</p>

<p>But it was like some sort of masochistic delight, with rice and chickpeas and Jill-approved (read: not fatty) chicken. I wanted to stop eating and stop sweating but I just couldn’t. Halfway through Charlie got up and ordered a mango lassi, a beverage made with yogurt. It was a balm on my tongue, but didn’t do much for my esophagus. BUT I DIDN’T CARE. I was determined. And it was so delicious, I wanted to keep eating. Near the end, I took a break and let Charlie have a few bites. I took a last swig of lassi, then attacked the rest. Whoever thought to put tikka masala in a burrito is a freaking genius.</p>
<p>I toweled off, and we went for a short walk around the neighborhood. We both thought it was too hot even though it couldn’t have been more than 75 degrees. Instead of acting like fun, responsible adults, we came home and immediately fell asleep on the couch.</p>
<p>This can only bode well for eating and drinking my way through California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, my mom and aunts came in to town to visit and to go out to dinner. My first thought was that it was yet another opportunity for me to procrastinate being a healthy, productive human being. The second thought was that the pressure was on.</p>
<p>I’ve brought up my aunts in this column before, because they are the foodiest people I know. They are both excellent chefs and have very discerning palettes. When their daughter, my cousin Caroline, was about six years old, her favorite food was lobster bisque. So, there’s that. And I was determined to give my mom some sort of redeeming Boston seafood experience that didn’t involve a waiter touching her food.</p>
<p>My mother is so charmed with being around me in general that she is not very worried about where we will eat, but I’m always determined to impress my aunts, as if it’s me that’s doing the cooking. (Side note: When we talk about cooking, they always say I should cook for them. Given my recent diet and tendency to mess things up, I don’t foresee anything less than disaster.) I trust Yelp with my life (and tastebuds) when it comes to restaurants, so I headed into Yelpland to find a restaurant near my apartment. And up comes Hungry Mother. It was one of the only restaurants I have ever seen with almost all five-star ratings. Hungry Mother cooks up an upscale southern cuisine, with a short menu, changing often. I considered it a good sign that there was only one early time slot open for reservations on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Hungry Mother was hard to find, with a swinging wooden sign on the corner of a remodeled home. When we got there, the doors were locked. My nerves were stretched thin because it was windy and cold, and we hadn’t had a chance to go home and change, so I was worried that we were underdressed in jeans. I was ravenous and deliberated abandoning propriety and banging on the door until someone took pity on us and let us in to shut me up. But soon it was five o’clock, time for them to open and our reservation, and we headed inside.</p>
<p>The hostess led us past the kitchen where people were donning aprons and up stairs. The décor was homey, and I immediately felt at ease wearing jeans. The tables were wooden, with lights meant to imitate candles on the tables. It was dim, but not too dim, and small, but not crowded. The hostess took our coats and hung them up for us. A server came over and filled our water glasses, which were not water glasses at all, but jelly jars. The adorableness was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Our waiter, John, was knowledgeable and recommended the salad with smoked lamb tongue (aged for 15 hours!) and their market side of roasted squash. Despite the way he managed to talk up TONGUE, there was no way we were going to ingest that, but we went with the squash. We also ordered the appetizers of deviled eggs, and biscuits with prosciutto and red pepper jelly. While we waited, we sampled several of their cocktails (I had the dangerously tasty no. 61 with Rain vodka, St. Germain, fresh grapefruit, and ginger Cinzano), which helped calm us, because expectations were really, really high.</p>
<p>The deviled eggs came with little pieces of bacon on top, which can only mean good things. They were creamy, with the perfect balance of mustard and mayonnaise and spice. One of my aunts grew up in the south, and gave the stamp of approval to the biscuits and jelly. Even after our meal was over, she was still thinking about them. </p>
<p>And then our meals and side dishes came. All at the same time, all hot. I had the chicken and dumplings, which was really a chicken, roasted to crispy perfection, on a bed of collard greens and carrots, surrounded by heavenly gnocchi. (Start counting: I have already used the word “perfect” twice.) The chicken was tender, the gnocchi fresh, and god help me, I enjoyed the collard greens. Eight-year-old me was appalled, and I have no idea what they did to them to make them so delicious, but I suspect something to do with butter. We were moaning and groaning and causing a general scene with our noises of deliciousness. My mother loved her cornmeal catfish and dirty rice dish, one of their signatures. She said that I had used the word “foodgasm” way too early in my column. Despite the fact that I don’t like hearing the suffix –gasm from my mother’s mouth, I would agree. My boyfriend had better watch out. That gnocchi was charming the hell out of me.</p>
<p>Not to mention the squash with skin roasted so perfectly (count: 3) that we could eat it all, meat and skin. Not to mention the cheesy, creamy grits. And the cornbread, which was roasted in some sort of sweet sauce and I think deep-fried, and served with sorghum butter, was so mouthwatering I wanted to close my eyes to eat it. I might have&mdash;pretty much all of my senses were dulled except for taste.</p>
<p>And then there came the desserts. Yes. We ordered four. A roasted pear and bourbon ice cream cake, a steamed apple pudding, a burnt caramel pot de crème, and a flourless Taza chocolate torte (with a side glass of almond milk to wash down the chocolate, which I would later spill and almost cry over it). I was having a serious dilemma with so many delicious things on the table. While every single bite was incredible, I decided the steamed apple pudding was my favorite. It came with whipped crème fraiche and, best of all, a salted piece of cornbread. I’m no expert on food pairings, but the salty cornbread with the sweet pieces of apple was divine.</p>
<p>I can say that it was, without a doubt, the best meal I have ever eaten. It eclipsed Restaurant Week completely. There was no low point. Service was terrific, prices aren’t outrageous, the food was incredible, and, best of all, unpretentious. Even the foodies went home satisfied and impressed. We wanted to curl up and sleep there. After dessert, we asked for brunch menus. </p>
<p> It’s been more than 24 hours, and I am still thinking about the food. </p>
