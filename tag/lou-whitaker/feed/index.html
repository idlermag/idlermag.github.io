										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re here today to celebrate the union of Laura and Ben, and provide witness to their enduring partnership.</p>
<p>Partnership. </p>
<p>When I spoke with Laura and Ben about what they wanted me to say today, that&#8217;s the one word that came up again and again.</p>
<p>And, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, we can&#8217;t talk about partnerships without talking about the best partnership in the history of the word:</p>
<p>Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker.</p>
<p>For those of you who didn&#8217;t grow up in Michigan, obsessed with the Detroit Tigers, a little history:</p>
<p>Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell played side by side for nineteen seasons. </p>
<p>They started out together at Double A Montgomery, where they first assumed the roles that would define them: Whitaker at second base, Trammell at short stop.</p>
<p>For nineteen seasons, one World Series Championship, seven Gold Gloves and eleven All-Star selections, they did together the same things Laura and Ben have, and will do together.</p>
<p>You anticipate your partner&#8217;s needs. </p>
<p>You cover their back when they make a mistake.</p>
<p>When they end up on their back, you offer your hand.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re not here to talk about baseball &#8212; but we can learn a few things from Lou and Alan.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s all about <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121260/index.htm" target="_blank">WE</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the damndest thing,&#8221; Houk said. &#8220;You tell one of them something and he says, &#8216;We can do it.&#8217; Like they&#8217;re a team.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Second, you do the big stuff together &#8212; and you support each other.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1977 they roomed and played together at Montgomery in the Class AA Southern League. &#8220;We did everything together,&#8221; says Whitaker. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have anybody else.&#8221; Says Trammell, &#8220;We comforted each other a little. If one of us had a bad night, the other one wouldn&#8217;t let it get him down. We sort of used each other as crutches, and we became pretty close.&#8221; </p>
<p>Whitaker hit .280. Trammell batted .291, broke Reggie Jackson&#8217;s league record for triples with 19 and was named league MVP. Brinkman, their manager, says, &#8220;They could&#8217;ve been co-MVPs that year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And last, you complement one another.</p>
<p>Being partners doesn&#8217;t mean being the same. Lou batted lefty, Alan from the right side. </p>
<p>And being partners means loving each other for your faults, not just your talents.</p>
<p>For all the gold gloves, Trammell was such a klutz that no one wanted to sit next to him at dinner &#8212; they&#8217;d end up covered in his spaghetti.</p>
<p>Lou, for all his natural athletic prowess, couldn&#8217;t lay off the junk food. That&#8217;s why they called him Sweet Lou. </p>
<p>Neither was perfect, but together, they were close. </p>
<p>To me, that&#8217;s what a good partnership is &#8212; you&#8217;re each pretty great on your own. That much, everyone here knows already.</p>
<p>But together, you&#8217;re better. Together, you&#8217;re champs.</p>
<p>Laura and Ben, as you being the next phase of your lives together, I can think of nothing more to wish for you than that you become co-MVPs; that you conquer the challenges of life the way Lou and Alan conquered the infield: together.</p>
