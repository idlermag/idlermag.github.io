										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as a nonfiction writer, I’ve already managed to lie to you before I even start. Quit cooking, start reading is not quite true &#8212; I pretty much never stop reading. Not to eat, brush my teeth, not even when cleaning the kitchen or taking a walk. I read my way through the winter hibernation and through the summer vacations. Whenever I fly, I carry 2-3 books on the plane with me because I’m too cheap for an e-reader and because I’m likely to get through at least two. The back problems are totally worth it.</p>
<p>One of my professors sent me the reading list for my fall literature class ahead of time so that we can go ahead and get started. A cooler person than me might have been dismayed, but it made me thrilled to start school. Partly, I was psyched because I’d already read some of the things on the list, which made me feel educated as hell. And that meant I could reread them, actually remember them, and maybe think of some smart shit to say ahead of time in class. (But not too many smart things &#8212; no one wants to be THAT girl, and I don’t want to be shunned at the after-class happy hour.) I’ve already started rereading Nabokov’s <em>Lolita</em>, and have been keeping a list of the beautiful and inventive language he uses so that I can try to learn something while I limp along in my novicehood.</p>
<p>For example: “. . . a poplar playing its liquid shadows all over the local Honor Roll” (p. 137); the backyard with “apple-green light” (p. 31); Lolita with “all four limbs starfished” across the chair (p. 174). Oh dear, I got too Englishy. But if you can’t appreciate the gorgeous prose, then I probably can’t appreciate you. I’m also excited to reread Raymond Carver’s short stories “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” and “Beginners.”</p>
<p>I expect to probably be cooking much less when I’m in school, and writing to you about the best ways to jazz up rice and beans, writing a treatise on the various forms of caffeine, or on the best way to discreetly drink wine during workshop. But before I do all of that, I’m headed back to Michigan with my dad’s side of the family and Charlie to go up north to one of my most favorite places.</p>

<p>We all spend a ton of time reading up there, moving from the hammock to the dock, to the pontoon, to a lawn chair, and back to the hammock again. My dad reads exactly one book a year. He always reads it up north, and it’s always about music. Last year I let him borrow my copy of Steve Almond’s book <em>Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life</em>, with its companion playlist. The year before that, he read Keith Richards’s <em>Life</em>, and read aloud anecdotes about prostitutes and drug cocktails. The year before that, it was Alice Cooper’s book <em>Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roller&#8217;s 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict</em> (which is actually pretty hilarious).</p>
<p>For me, I found a used book at the lovely <a href="http://www.greenapplebooks.com/" target="_blank">Green Apple Books</a> called <em>Not for Bread Alone: Writers on Food, Wine, and the Art of Eating</em>, edited by Daniel Halpern. It’s a collection of food writing from well-known writers, including Wendell Berry, Charles Simic, Joyce Carol Oates, and Francine Prose, among others. Before I get started with classes and get buried under class readings, I’m bringing that one up north, along with Julia Child’s <em>My Life in France</em>, which was given to me as a gift and I MUST READ before I lose all steam.</p>
<p>Reading while lying in the sun and/or eating is one of the things I enjoy most. I wish you all a happy summer, and happy reading!</p>
