										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we are, just days away from my favorite holiday and I’ve barely even noticed that Halloween is upon us. Life has gotten in the way this year. There has been no time for my nightly veg sessions in front of AMC’s fear fest; no time for the myriad of horror countdowns on the Chiller channel. My wife and I were in the process of house hunting. Now we’re in the process of closing. There’s new software at work for me to deal with. There’s also blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Enough already. You have to make time for the things you love, right? And so, when <em>Rec 2</em> (2009) landed in my mailbox (Courtesy of Qwi-I mean, Netflix) yesterday I resolved to finally take some time out for the <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/01/fall-of-the-living-dead/">subgenre that had started my Halloween obsession</a> all those years ago: zombie films.</p>
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Pet Semetary kid" src="https://i1.wp.com/28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lb3m27jdw71qb857mo1_400.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;You think you can name me Gage and just GET AWAY WITH IT?!&quot;</p></div>
<p>I immediately pulled up the Fear Fest schedule this year and, aside from finding it to be very <em>Halloween </em>(1978) heavy this year (Including <em>Halloween H20 </em>(1998), but suspiciously excluding <em>Halloween: Resurrection </em>(2002), starring Sir Busta Rhymes), I found it to be just as solid as usual. <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> (1967) had already aired, but given the fact that I have three different versions of it on DVD, I wasn’t sweating that too much. I still had <em>Slither</em> (2006) and <em>Pet Semetary</em> (1989) to look forward to. Yes, I realize that <em>Pet Semetary </em>isn’t what one traditionally thinks of as a zombie film, but tell that to the undead kid with the scalpel who wants to play with you.</p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<div class="mceTemp">
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Flight of the living dead" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/planedead.jpg?w=320&#038;h=213" alt="" width="320" height="213" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wanna join the mile die club?</p></div>
<p>Romero’s <em>Diary of the Dead</em> (2007) and <em>Survival of the Dead</em> (2009) were in there as well, but I immediately disregarded them as sad signs of a once great talent now merely going through the motions. Not to mention highlighting his complete lack of understanding with regards to current technology. Seriously, George, a small clan of Irishmen living on a tiny island (not in Ireland, mind you) decide to create a web video to lure people to them? Really? <em>Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane</em> (2007), not a Romero film, also snuck its way into the lineup, continuing the time-honored “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, just put it on a plane” formula.</div>
</div>
<p>And so, armed with <em>Slither</em>, <em>Pet Semetary</em>, <em>Rec 2, </em>and a darkened living room I attempt to recapture my Halloween spirit. Oh, and what’s that Netlfix? You now have the entire first season of AMC’s <em>The Walking Dead</em> streaming? Nicely done. The good news is: I think I’m already good for next year. Having just had a home inspection on our potential new property I noticed that the current residents had a huge bowl of candy on their kitchen counter, just waiting.</p>

<p>A great deal of the film is spent watching Mazzy &#8220;do his thing,&#8221; much to the chagrin of his producer (Lisa Houle) and amusement of his board operator (Georgina Reilly). Mazzy&#8217;s &#8220;thing,&#8221; it seems, is pissing people off.  And though we get little to no explanation as to why he was fired from his original job and plopped in the small town of Pontypool, Ontario, we can guess.  The man lives to start trouble.  Turns out this town doesn&#8217;t really need his help. </p>
<p>Soon, Mazzy begins receiving phone calls describing scenes of mob violence randomly erupting all over town. Seems some folks have taken to babbling incoherently and eventually assaulting their fellow. . . Pontypoolians? Pontypoolans? Whatever. Point is, the source of this zombie-like behavior is revealed to be lurking somewhere within the English language itself, begging Mazzy to wonder whether his on-the-spot updates might be hurting more than helping.</p>
<p>I realize that you&#8217;ve probably gotten hung up on that whole &#8220;lurking within the English language itself&#8221; business.  I must warn you that I can be of little help with any real explanation and I certainly wouldn&#8217;t hope for <em>Pontypool</em> to give you one either.  It is far more interested in the metaphorical, it seems, than the literal. It&#8217;s taking the social commentary of Romero&#8217;s zombie films to an extreme and this is really where the film begins to derail. </p>
<p>The power of language as well as the construction and deconstruction of words are interesting topics, but do they really have any place in a zombie film?  I suppose I appreciate the attempt to bring something new to the table, even if it doesn&#8217;t quite work.  It&#8217;s just that <em>Pontypool</em> gets so strange and esoteric by the later half of the film that it kind of blindsides you.  Couple that with an ending that&#8217;s a bit less than satisfying and what you have is a film whose reach far exceeds its grasp. So just what exactly is it about the English language that&#8217;s setting people off?  It&#8217;s really best if we don&#8217;t talk about it.</p>
<p>*NOTE: Yes, I do realize how many times I used &#8220;Pontypool&#8221; in this review. There&#8217;s something hypnotic about it, don&#8217;t you think? Pontypool. . . Pontypool. . .</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was six years old my mother took myself, her best friend and a station wagon full of children to see <em>Gremlins</em> (1984) at a nearby drive-in theatre. We lay out on the roof, full bags of candy spread out before us. The other children were older than me. I wanted to be brave. And when it came time to drop my mother's best friend and the other children back off at their home&#8212;which sat far back from the street&#8212;I remember being left alone in our dark car for what seemed like an eternity, staring at the void below my dangling feet, sure a gremlin's face would slowly reveal itself. In short, <em>Gremlins</em> destroyed little six year old me. But it also began a lifelong fascination with horror films that was partially nurtured by a pre-cable, metro Detroit television staple: Channel twenty's <em>Thriller Double Feature</em>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was six years old my mother took myself, her best friend and a station wagon full of children to see <em>Gremlins</em> (1984) at a nearby drive-in theatre. We lay out on the roof, full bags of candy spread out before us. The other children were older than me. I wanted to be brave. And when it came time to drop my mother&#8217;s best friend and the other children back off at their home&mdash;which sat far back from the street&mdash;I remember being left alone in our dark car for what seemed like an eternity, staring at the void below my dangling feet, sure a gremlin&#8217;s face would slowly reveal itself. In short, <em>Gremlins</em> destroyed little six year old me. But it also began a lifelong fascination with horror films that was partially nurtured by a pre-cable, metro Detroit television staple: Channel twenty&#8217;s <em>Thriller Double Feature</em>.</p>
<p>Every Saturday afternoon I commandeered the television for four hours and was treated to the cream of the crop of the bottom of the barrel. I cared little for the quality of what I was watching. I had no context to draw from. I simply devoured one horror film after another.</p>

<p>Sometimes you’d get a half way decent flick, like Dolls (1987), directed by Stuart Gordon, which got heavy rotation on <em>Thriller</em> and featured a little girl who, longing for attention, made friends with some murderous dolls. Despite the corny acting and simplistic premise, <em>Dolls</em> made some great use of light and sound, featuring some classic lightening flashes and substituting SFX for the creepy pitter-patter of doll feet on a hard wood floor. My sister&#8217;s own doll collection solidified this one’s stay in my subconscious.</p>

No! She was terrifying! Even in E.T.! Especially in E.T.!</p></div><em>Cat’s Eye</em> (1985), which featured a script by Stephen King as well as the acting talents of James Woods and a young Drew Barrymore, was one of many anthology films that made regular appearances. Its first two stories were relatively forgettable, but Barrymore’s story&mdash;which was a play on the old myth that cats steal your breath while you sleep&mdash;was pretty fun. Both <em>Creepshow</em> (1982) and <em>Creepshow 2</em> (1987) popped up periodically, also offering some writing from Stephen King, this time aided by the direction of George Romero.  I fondly recall Leslie Neilsen, buried up to his neck in sand as the tide rolls in, screaming, “I can hold my breath for a very long time!” They were pure camp, throwbacks to the EC horror comics that eventually inspired the British anthology film <em>Tales from the Crypt</em> (1972) and the television series of the same name.</p>

It starred Karen Black (who was actually the lead in all three tales) as a young woman who purchases a Zuni fetish doll as a gift. It comes with a scroll claiming that the doll contains the spirit of “He Who Kills” and the only thing keeping it at bay is a golden chain around the doll’s neck. Of course the chain falls off. What follows is a pretty creepy little cat and mouse game through Black’s apartment as the doll relentlessly slashes at her from off camera with only the sound of his feet and snarling voice to indicate his whereabouts.  The films final shot still haunts me, as Karen Black hunches down in her living room, now possessed by “He Who Kills,” carving at the floor with a knife, mouth filled with razor sharp teeth.</p>
<p>Those were the days.  And now I must save myself, because <em>The Idler</em> is absolutely NOT a nostalgia site, and recommend that you seek out these films via OnDemand, Netflix and your local video store (quick! While it still exists!) this Halloween. Grab a bag of candy and don&#8217;t be ashamed to pump up the original <em>Thriller Double Feature</em> commercial beforehand. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>So it&#8217;s officially October and Fall is upon us.  More importantly, Halloween is just around the corner, which has finally given the </em><em>Cinephiles</em><em> an excuse to focus exclusively on horror for an entire month!  We&#8217;ll kick things off with a childhood favorite of mine, George Romero&#8217;s </em>Night of the Living Dead<em>.</em></p>
<p>If you can watch <em>Night of The Living Dead</em> on an old, 10&#8243; black-and-white television, huddled under a tent made from your own bedding, I&#8217;d highly recommend you do so. The more intimate the viewing, the better.  In fact, I believe it to be one of those rare horror films that doesn&#8217;t necessarily benefit from audience participation.  It wants to scare you on a much deeper, more personal level.</p>
<p>The  story is simple:  A young man and woman, brother and sister, stop by a cemetery  to pay respects.  It is eerily quiet.  There are no other mourners (Sometimes a  small budget can be a blessing in disguise).  As the young man teases his  obviously frightened sister with the immortal line, &#8220;They&#8217;re coming to get you  Barbara,&#8221; a shabbily dressed man approaches and attacks her.  Her brother is  killed in the scuffle, forcing her to retreat to a nearby farmhouse where she encounters a small group of people with similar stories. After  discovering a television, not unlike the ideal one I mentioned earlier, they learn from the local news that the recently deceased are &#8220;returning to life and devouring the flesh of their victims.&#8221;  It&#8217;s pretty grim stuff, and having grown up on the camp of &#8220;Channel 20&#8217;s Thriller Double Feature&#8221; I was ill-prepared for the loss of humanity in <em>Night of The Living Dead</em>.  It shook me.  Normal people reduced to mindless, soulless killing machines.  The monsters here were our own friends and family.</p>

As the flames die down, the ghouls  slowly approach and begin tearing at the charred bodies, devouring them part by part, organ by organ.  It&#8217;s a long sequence and it&#8217;s filmed by an unflinching  camera.  Roger Ebert described this transition in his review, stating that the film had gone from being &#8220;delightfully scary about halfway through, and had  become unexpectedly terrifying.&#8221;  And with that, writer/Director George Romero had reinvented the zombie film (More on that later).</p>
<p>Some argue (justly so) that the film&#8217;s sequel, <em>Dawn of The Dead</em> is the superior film.  And while <em>Dawn</em>&#8216;s story is  larger in scope, its social commentary more deliberate and it&#8217;s SFX vastly improved, it&#8217;s hard for me to agree that <em>Dawn</em> is the <em>scarier</em> film.  There&#8217;s something about its predecessor that just sticks with me.  Perhaps it still makes me feel like a scared little kid hiding under his blanket?  Or perhaps it&#8217;s the scene near the end where a little girl kills her own mother with a trowel?  Yeah, that&#8217;ll do it.</p>
