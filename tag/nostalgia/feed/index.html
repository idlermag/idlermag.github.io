										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to admit that I am way behind <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/22/cave-story-power-up/">Daniel</a> and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/23/cave-story-the-zig-zag-world/">Gavin</a> in my playthrough of <em>Cave Story</em> because I have been clocking a lot of hours into <em>Diablo III</em>, which actually makes for an interesting comparison.</p>
<p>Like <em>Cave Story</em>, <em>Diablo III</em> is a game that panders to one&#8217;s nostalgia, in this case nostalgia for <em>Diablo II</em>, released way back in 2000. I remember coming home from summer camp and pouring all of my time into accumulating new weapons and armor for my Amazon. The point of the Diablo games isn&#8217;t to defeat monsters; it&#8217;s to collect more stuff, which is good for helping you collect more stuff. <em>Diablo III</em> is certainly a vast improvement upon its predecessor, but overall, it&#8217;s really the same game built for 2013. I won&#8217;t say too much more about Diablo, since I&#8217;m supposed to be talking about <em>Cave Story</em>, but basically <em>Diablo III</em> has all the talent and polish of a triple-A title. And for those reasons, it basically has no heart.</p>
<p>Few games have more heart than <em>Cave Story</em>. It was painstakingly hand-crafted (so to speak) by Daisuke Amaya, who designed and developed the game by himself over the course of five years. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogs.vandal.net/12458/vm/13302725112007" target="_blank">decent interview</a> with Amaya, where he explains that his work on the game paralleled his life: &#8220;At the time I started work on <em>Cave Story</em>, I was a student, but now I&#8217;m an office worker. My entire life had changed by the time this game was finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right: Amaya is not a game developer by trade, so he created the art, music, and story, as well as all the code, in his free time. It may be a nostalgic platformer, but <em>Cave Story</em> feels like the personal expression of one man. We all love the game&#8217;s weirdness (or in Daniel&#8217;s words, the <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/15/cave-story-lets-get-retro/">&#8220;WTF factor&#8221;</a>), which is something that can only come from the vision and imagination of singular vision.</p>
<p>So why am I not compelled to play more <em>Cave Story</em>? </p>
<p>For me, the appeal of <em>Cave Story</em> is its charm. Sure, it&#8217;s fun to jump around and fire rockets, but I love uncovering the uniqueness buried beneath the <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired platforming. <em>Diablo</em>, on the other hand, is designed to be addictive. And it is very good at that, almost to the point of blandness. The game says and means nothing.</p>
<p>While both are designed to make you think about the good old days, I think there&#8217;s a single key difference between the two games: <em>Cave Story</em> celebrates nostalgia, while <em>Diablo III</em> exploits it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sweet Jesus that song, that song. That sound, that sample, that lyric. Every time I hear The Verve&#8217;s &#8220;Bitter Sweet Symphony,&#8221; every single solitary time I hear the opening refrain of the song I sigh, droop my shoulders, and hear the hairs stand up on end all over my frame. I can remember Australian streets, college hallways, the smell of freshly cut grass on a warm January day. I can hear it all in those few seconds. I can taste the air. I cam remember the passions and the pains of being 23 and an abject failure.</p>

<p>As I write this I look down at my hands, illuminated by the computer monitor. I see wrinkles, thinning skin, veins rising as the flesh thins. They are the hands of my parents not my own anymore. I lived with <em>Urban Hymns</em> as my soundtrack for six weeks. I listened to the album like taking vitamins. Every day it started my day. Every evening it ended it. Many a time I awoke to my walkman on the floor, batteries expired, the tape paused midway through. The walkman, the trusty yellow walkman with auto-reverse, ensuring a never-ending continuous play.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MH6TJU0qWoY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I remember the sounds of the street and the sights of the city soundtracked by this LP for hours at once. I remember listening to the closing song, headphones on, stereo speakers having moved out with the roommate, listening, high volume, sitting on the floor, singing along howling along screaming along, pounding the floor, pouring out frustration and anguish and anger and loneliness and insanity. I remember finding the promo copy of the LP, shaped like a prayer book next to the store stereo and feeling my pulse rise. I remember writing a pretty clunky, cliché ridden review for Michigan State University&#8217;s <em>State News</em> (some things never go out of style). I remember buying a ticket to the concert at the Palace and I remember telling a co-worker that she didn’t want to go to the concert with me &#8217;cause she didn’t want to get pregnant again.</p>
<p>I remember, years later, finding the LP that the sample of the song came from and feeling those waves in a different fashion. I remember watching a record label promotional video reel loop and seeing dark hair and black leather walking down a street in an unmoving line, impervious to everything around him, a trait one wishes was available to everyone. I remember hearing the direct, pure &#8220;fuck you&#8221; in the closing track, a declaration of intent, of anger, of challenge, of everything people tried to get rock music banned for in the 60s. I feel youth slipping away, opportunity slipping away, life slipping through fingers like strands. I would give anything to feel it again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s something so sincere about Muppets. Though made of felt in Crayola colors, they seem to radiate something more human than the human. A stringy ear shake from Sesame Street’s Barkley, a gentle spindly-frog-armed gesture from Kermit, a huffy contraction of the snout from Piggy &#8211;these non-verbal cues were so expressive and meaningful and alive. The Muppets Jim Henson reared are a delightfully strange, cheerily irreverent, intensely empathic, wild, caring, and fun bunch. Jason Segel and Nick Stoller did a pretty great job of reviving these essential Muppet traits in the recently released film, The Muppets, even as the movie itchily reminds us that we can never really bring back time (or Muppets) past.</p>
<p>Ultimately, art imitates life as both the film’s story and its actual production focus on the basic goal of “getting the band back together.” Segel, an avid Muppet fan (see <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em> for a nod at his obsession) was saddened by the presence, or lack thereof, of Muppetry in the 2000s. He saw his childhood friends, once hobnobbing with the likes of Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin, now reduced to cheesy hawkers of pan pizza and the like on stupid television commercials. His project <em>The Muppets</em> (2011) would thus rescue our pop culture icons from obscurity and restore them to their proper place in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>Likewise, within the film we find Henson’s crew lost and scattered across the globe. Kermit’s Hollywood mansion is a decrepit and cobweb-covered mausoleum &#8212; a shrine to a dead past (think a less creepy <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>).  The movie shows us the world as it is now: chock-full of reality shows that capitalize on our least admirable human qualities and aim for the lowest level of thought, comedy and viewer engagement. In this world, the Muppets are a memory, something we recall from a time before, but a group that has fallen too far behind to be viable.  Is there room for the intricate gesticulating of handmade felt Muppets in our digitized, multitasking, screen-based land of plenty? This is what the film (and Segel) ask, and I bet you can guess their answer.</p>
<p>The tone toward the Muppets is right. The respect for Henson’s clan is palpable, cleverly rendered and tender. The musical numbers are pleasurable (if not all knock-outs) and quirkily styled by Bret McKenzie of <em>Flight of the Conchords</em> fame. &#8220;Muppet or a Man&#8221; is the movie’s catchy and clear stand-out of a song, but it’s the old standards (&#8220;Rainbow Connection,&#8221; &#8220;The Muppet Show theme&#8221;) that shake an audience member, like me, to the core.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is this: the movie is pretty good, yet it’s not what I remember. It’s not a Jim Henson Muppet movie. In trying to bring the Muppets back, it mostly reminds me that the Muppets and the time of the Muppets &#8212; my childhood spent awestruck by a rainbow busting through a movie studio ceiling, moments when Kermie’s felty fingers touched my heart because even without being green, I understood what he meant when he said it wasn’t easy &#8212; are lost to the tricks of time.  Though I can try to reconfigure these fragments to some extent, like the movie re-pieces together the scattered Muppets, the initial loss continues to leave a gaping hole in my squishy red innards.</p>
<p>I cried at least three times during this movie.  It killed me to see Kermit’s movie lot office in tatters &#8212; a framed picture of Jim Henson displayed under a skin of dust, hung there for no one.  Then there was the pang in the gut, the sour ball of throat tears that came when Kermit apologized to Fozzie for losing touch &#8212; a shame all of us grown-ups comprehend.  And of course, hearing &#8220;Rainbow Connection&#8221; again, the way it prickles my skin and digs into me with its instant nostalgia.  The song is housed once more in a Muppet movie, but not one I know from before; it’s transplanted, grafted onto the new.</p>
<p>I suffer a postmodern crisis.</p>
<p>Plush childhood things have been shifted into an adult schema. I never wanted to know that Piggy and Kermie got divorced! I never wanted to see Fozzie a washed up comedy bear in Reno! However, the movie also does something pretty remarkable in that it allows me to feel, re-feel and reflect on lost time, on missing a childhood that was so intricately tied to a bunch of fancy puppets. The Muppets is part adult, part child. . . part muppet &#8212; a mish-mash that at once feels disjointed and unsatisfying and the pitch perfect conglomeration for exploring such subject matter. Am I making myself clear? Perhaps it is best said in song:</p>
<blockquote><p>I reflect on my reflection<br />
And I ask myself the question:<br />
What’s the right direction to go?<br />
I don’t know.<br />
Am I a man, or am I a Muppet?<br />
If I’m a Muppet then I’m a very manly Muppet.<br />
Am I a Muppet or am I a man?<br />
If I’m a man, that makes me a Muppet of a man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Am I a Muppet or a (wo)man?  Indeed.  A pretty heady question.</p>
<p>Jim Henson’s unique magic was a creative power that made anyone, of any age, feel the wonder of childhood. This latest movie further solidifies the fact that we can never replace him or his art. What Segel brings with his film is no Henson substitute, but something new with its own charm. From the fan’s perspective, he extends a thank you to Jim and Kermit and friends &#8212; one that valiantly tries to articulate paradoxical distances. One that says, “it’s been really hard growing up without you, even though I know you’ve been with me all along.”</p>
