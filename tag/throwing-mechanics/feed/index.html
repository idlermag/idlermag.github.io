										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It started when  Joel Zumaya faced <a target="new" href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/11/bad-news-for-joel-zumaya/">another setback</a>. Which would seem to be just a very Zumaya-esque form of horrible, gut-wrenchingly unfair luck for a kid who just seems so deserving of success&mdash;until I remembered reading <a target="new" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tom_verducci/03/08/stephen.strasburg.mechanics/index.html">this wonderful Sports Illustrated piece about Zoom Zoom&#8217;s mechanics</a>.</p>
<p>What? What? You mean to tell me that in the past 5 years, the Tigers&#8217; pitching staff hasn&#8217;t bothered to address Joel&#8217;s mother-trucking mechanics issues? </p>
<p>What do they do all day, if not work to protect and extend the life of one of their most promising young arms? As a mother&mdash;and we know I feel very maternally for Joel&mdash;I am fucking pissed. Chuck Hernandez, Rick Knapp, why haven&#8217;t you fixed this? The knock on Joel that he&#8217;s just fragile when, REALITY, he&#8217;s prone to injury because his MECHANICS ARE FAULTY&mdash;that&#8217;s your fault, Chuck, and yours too, Rick.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s your JOB to work on these issues. Now, before you get all whiny with me or explain how hard it is to alter some lifelong mechanics, let me say: bullshit. First, again, it is your job. Second, it is also Zumaya&#8217;s job. Third, what else do you have to do?</p>
<p>Example: I hired a coach. I have thrown sidearm, mechanically poor and physically prone to injury, since I was five. Now, 26 years later, it took less than 25 one-hour sessions to fix.  And I&#8217;m not even getting paid to throw! Now, if my coach&mdash;who is awesome, obviously&mdash;can fix my arm, why can&#8217;t a major league coach fix a relatively simple major league mechanical flaw?</p>
<p>It got me thinking about what appears to be a systemic issue for the Tigers: the coaching isn&#8217;t working, if it is happening at all.</p>
<p>Example: As I learned from watching Ken Burns&#8217; latest installment of <em>Baseball</em>, the reason the Yankees are dominant is because they fucking rock out at situational hitting. That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s not dumb luck that a soft single lands in right field on a full count after three foul balls with a man on third. It&#8217;s the product of months and years of practice.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox are also killer when it comes to situational hitting. The Twins work on it in batting practice&mdash;even before road games. The Tigers?</p>
<p>Well, as my friend Brett pointed out this weekend, the Tigers haven&#8217;t gotten any better at situational hitting or even baserunning in the past 5 years. (See: Will Rhymes&#8217; slide that featured him TOUCHING THE CATCHER&#8217;S GLOVE, essentially tagging himself out&mdash;because the umpire mistakenly thought the catcher had the ball in his glove.)</p>
<p>When you take a look at what&#8217;s plagued the Tigers for years now, it becomes obvious where the failure of coaching comes into play.</p>
<p>How do you lose a game 2-0 when Verlander pitches a gem? When you leave men on base, which the Tigers do <em>en masse</em> night after night after night.</p>
<p>Saturday, it was Magglio Ordonez swinging (for the fences) on the first pitch with the bases loaded. Fly ball out, side retired, goodnight. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s something deeply wrong with the approach to hitting taken by the hitting coach when a.) your 7,8,9 hitters fare better than your 1,2 hitters and b.) your hitters never seem to improve at situational hitting or plate patience.</p>
<p>How many times have we heard Jim Leyland, who we all know I absolutely adore, say after the game that we just didn&#8217;t hit the guys around? </p>
<p>What I want to know is what the repercussions are for it?</p>
<p>When I hack at pitches outside the strike zone during batting practice, my coach adds ten pushups to my payment. That&#8217;s right&mdash;I pay him, and he punishes me for getting lazy. What happens to Magglio, Jackson, Rhymes, etc., etc., etc.? What happens when the entire team is swinging for the fences instead of taking the outside pitch opposite field?</p>
<p>Nothing. Which must be true, because we have seen little improvement.  And really, who bothers to change if there are no consequences for staying the same?</p>
<p>People, something has to give. It&#8217;s time, as my friend Kyle mentioned, to give up this idea that only second basemen can hit second in the order. It&#8217;s time to jettison this BS nonsense of &#8220;saving&#8221; your quality relievers for the upcoming series or the later innings when it&#8217;s more important to win NOW, to hold the lead NOW. </p>
<p>(As another pal, Steve, pointed out – it&#8217;s not like the Tigers have lost the AL Central 2 of the last 4 years by one game and these early wins aren&#8217;t important. Oh, wait.)</p>
<p>None of this absolves Leyland.</p>
<p>Leyland has got to stop managing these talented players like they&#8217;re the Miami Heat. We&#8217;ve seen him go ballistic on umpires – I&#8217;d like him to unleash some of that on players who don&#8217;t do the little things it takes – and the big things it takes – to win.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe we don&#8217;t want a full-fledged Ozzie Guillen type management experience in Detroit, but I don&#8217;t think holding players accountable is over the top. </p>
<p>Including, obviously, their off the field issues. As my friend Shane often lambastes Mark Dantonio for not punishing his troublemaking players, I think it&#8217;s time for Leyland to come down on Cabrera for his off-the-field train wrecks.</p>
<p>This team needs something. It needs a kick in the pants. It needs Jim Leyland to channel Sparky Anderson and bench slackers, send down struggling players and challenge his boys to do more than the bare minimum.</p>
<p>This team needs a coaching staff that isn&#8217;t afraid of the players and isn&#8217;t lacksadasical about DOING THEIR FUCKING JOBS. That means getting Austin Jackson out of bed at 7 am, Lloyd, and hitting off the tee and then with a bullpen catcher pitching some live toss until he fixes his timing. You&#8217;re a hitting coach. This is an easy fix.</p>
<p>That means, Rick Knapp, fixing the mechanics of gunners like Zumaya and working with every pitcher in the rotation and the bullpen to pinpoint what they&#8217;re doing wrong – and fix it.</p>
<p>That means hiring a bench coach who isn&#8217;t going to shrink away from asking Miguel why he was running for home on a bloop single to left. That means getting in the face of Raburn when he airmails it from the outfield.</p>
<p>It means making clear whose asses are on the line, and whose are going to be benched and kicked.</p>
<p>It means no more ass kissing, bitches. I&#8217;m tired of seeing this sparkless, gutless baseball. If I wanted to see this, I&#8217;d play the Lions 0-16 season on repeat. </p>
<p>Do it right, or take your talents to South Beach. We don&#8217;t have time for prima donnas and half-assing it here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I believe in being five<br />
my father teaching me to throw<br />
in the backyard/ our house on Crescent Avenue:<br />
sidearm<br />
hard<br />
almost no arc on the ball<br />
watched it tail </p>
<p>as a ten inch comet<br />
to my father’s open mitt.</p>
<p>	From FOR TIM (suggesting I name ten things I truly believe, which is really fucking impossible)</p></blockquote>
<p>I love my dad. My dad taught me to play baseball. I love my dad, and baseball, so much that I have nearly completed a book of poems about baseball. And my dad.</p>
<p>And my dad must love me a lot, too, in that way I see my husband loving our daughter&mdash;stuck somewhere between desperately attempting to keep said daughter in line, correcting her missteps, perfecting her; all without breaking her, or making her feel worthless, or, hell, even just pissing her off until she stomps her little foot and you are now oscillating somewhere between anger (she must get that attitude from her mother!) and even more love (maybe I should just give her a hug).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thrown sidearm&mdash;because my dad taught me that way. The rarity of it has made me resistant to change: there are a handful of sidearm pitchers&mdash;all relievers, I believe&mdash;but no sidearm-throwing fielders. And certainly, I&#8217;ve never in my life witnessed another girl cranking her body side-to-side to leverage the torque to uncoil and get a runner at third. </p>
<p>It made me feel like a gunslinger. And my dad, the John Wayne fan, must have known better than to try to fix it.</p>
<p>But there are obviously problems with it. First, there&#8217;s an incredible amount of tailing action on the ball. So while I may, say, be reasonably accurate on infield throws, coming up gunning from the outfield means my infielder needs to be ready to adjust. </p>
<p>Mechanically, it&#8217;s a nightmare&mdash;it&#8217;s just about the opposite of the exact right way to throw a ball. A good throw would be something like the Yankee&#8217;s Brett Gardner: coming over the top of the ball, snapping the elbow, a bit of snap to finish in the wrist, pulling the chest forward and toward the lead knee.</p>
<p>What was I doing? I was creating lateral rotation&mdash;think, the strange spinning handheld drum contraption from Karate Kid Part 2&mdash;to power my throw.</p>

There&#8217;s almost no work, in the physics sense, being done by my elbow. My wrist served as a rudder at best. And my chest never moved forward, into the proper finishing position, because I needed to prematurely abort my rotation&mdash;of the wrong axis&mdash;or risk throwing behind me; I needed to stay back, when proper form (and my current coach) dictate the opposite. </p>
<p>The rub is this: with such a mechanically unsound throw, I managed to grow into a decent outfielder (if not at times showing flashes of my idol, Bobby Higginson, by punishing runners who dared to tag up on me) but the ones that got away&mdash;those were the problems.</p>
<p>Mr. Plants, who coached me for two years in high school, tried in vain to correct my throw. The middling result came about from his knowing only about half the proper mechanics of a fundamentally sound throw&mdash;&#8221;thumb the ball past your thigh&#8221; &#8220;point to the target with your elbow&#8221;&mdash;and caused some unnamed injury that found me in right field, unable to lift my arm above my elbow, so severe was the pain in the joint of my shoulder, a handful of glass-covered pickaxes grinding.</p>
<p>So now, a few sessions in, one of the targeted improvements of my game (one of many, I assure you) is fixing, once and for all, this throw of mine.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not without a bit of sadness, a bit of nostalgia tingeing the memory of each coach I ever played for furrowing his brow and turning his head a bit, the memory of my father explaining to them that was just how I did it, that was how he taught me, all of it dimmed a bit in a wash of sepia.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit like the memory of the last cigarette I smoked, knowing it was just that, paying more attention than ever to the smoke hanging just in front of my cheeks, for once not waving my hand through it, for once, not wanting it to disappear.</p>
