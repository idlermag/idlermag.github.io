										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m from Las Cruces, New Mexico, a city populated by around 99,000 people where you can somehow still run into everyone you know at the Super Walmart on Valley Drive and Avenida de Mesilla. It’s the kind of place where high school sports rivalries are king, where teenagers huddle down into a dusty ditch bank and drink watered down beer while fields of cotton grow dry and wooly and the sun bakes the ground into a crack-fissured clay. The weather forecast forms a bingo board of little yellow sunshines, disturbed every once in a good while by thunderous storms that pour in fresh wet stripes punctuated with whipcrack flashes of lightning. </p>
<p>People there talk in funny accents &#8212; a marriage of cool, laid-back, Californian English and dramatically elongated Spanish syllables. One “gets down” from the car to go into the store, and carries the onus of a silly nickname like a mythological birthright. The food is fat with flavor, the culture, thick with artists. Stay long enough and a slow and sleepy boredom seeps deep into your bones, not a boredom that irritates so much as builds a gravity that keeps you in one place, makes you stay &#8212; warm, dream-heavy, happy. When choosing a grad school, I picked faraway places on the map fearing the lotus-eater lull of my beautiful home and an almost genetic tendency toward petrified paralysis. I’ve been working through the cold perspective of living in East Lansing, Michigan for about 10 years, now.</p>
<p>I’d never been to Boston, Massachusetts until a few weeks ago. Everything I knew of the place was a small collage of colonial history, Celtics basketball, the regulars of the downstairs bar, <em>Cheers</em>, and some dramatic scenes from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. (“I gawt huh numbuh&#8211;how bout them ah-pples?”) Representing the non-fiction journal I work for at MSU, I attended a conference for the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) in a complex hamster cage of a hotel conference center/shopping mall in downtown Boston. Imagine thousands of writers anxiously milling about in their scarves and wryly chosen spectacles. Aisle after aisle of booths, books, authors, publishers, editors. In some ways I felt completely at home. Not geographically, per se, but in my seat of comfort and power; I was in a place where my love for literature and language could find friendship and revel in nerdy delights. In other ways I felt completely lost and alienated. Amidst the movement, the clouds of chatter, the thousands of people just like me, I could at times feel dull, null, nil. </p>
<p>The snow outside was falling sideways in wet messy sheets. The streets were puddled with thick ice water ponds much deeper than my sneakered toe could dip. Inside, the conference hummed with body heat and dizzying distraction, the intermingling exhalations of too many mouths.</p>
<p>Making my way through the labyrinthine levels and turns, past the conference center, the Starbucks, the Coach store, beyond the reach of Armani, Louis Vuitton, the kiosks at the mall, down the escalator and across a hidden underpass below the exposed snowy street above, I bought a ticket on the train and booked it to Harvard. Nervous and alone I watched the stops on the map too closely. I focused tightly on the colored lines, the dots for each station, as Boston people populated and detrained the car with an easy indifference.</p>
<p>After trudging through slick muck in Harvard Square for at least twenty minutes, I was cold, lost, and spent, but I found the tattoo shop, finally. My friend’s brother, Sky, was my artist. He’s from my hometown, but I’d never met him. And here we were, together, two desert kids in Massachusetts telling stories of sun, Spanish art, the power of tamales and cholo style. And he was quiet, funny, smart, thoughtful, with a tiny Zia symbol etched behind his ear. A teacher, a maker, an avid Netflixer, much like myself. And he carved a red heart into my forearm, needled in colors of New Mexico sunsets onto the banner, marked my love of TV (with equal parts wink and sincerity) into the geography of my body. When the pain burned hotter and my eyes would roll back away from the whirring, Dia de los Muertos and retablo inspired pieces settled my gaze. We talked about loving a place, our home, and how we could never really go back. Our stories overlapping with the colors he was stitching. Intersecting lines and routes. Mappings. Intersecting lines and roots. </p>
<p>No longer lost, I made my way back to the dirty subway platform, still concrete and grey, still alien, but a little less scary, a little more known. Cold, tired, surrounded by strangers, I carried my new gift home. My heart throbbing in my coat sleeve, hidden, secret, and mine.</p>

<p>Signed, July 8th Cancer crab baby.  </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Shoes</strong>. Yep.  I always want shoes. These handsome grey Adidas would look pretty awesome with all my shorts situations. Comfy and stylish, retro but not outdated, these sneaks aren’t too nasty a kick in the money bags either.  Size 7, please.</p>

<p>Adidas Julrunner, $64.  <a href="http://www.adidas.com" target="_blank">www.adidas.com</a></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> I’m not much of a DVD buyer/collector. I have to *really* covet a film or TV show to purchase it because I’m not one to watch something over and over again. BUT, <em><strong>Louie</strong></em> is one of those shows that I can’t get enough of. . . which is probably weird. Most people I know feel deep discomfort when they walk through comedian Louie’s New York and see the world through his absurdist and depressing lens, but me, I ask for the DVD for my b-day.</p>

<p><em>Louie</em> Season One, $20. <a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  Okay, so I’ve avoided <strong>LUSH</strong> products for a while (I keep myself from things I might become addicted to) but I succumbed this past week when I was in the giant Chicago Macy’s. The saleswoman at the LUSH counter gently washed my hand in a delicious-smelling organic handmade shampoo &#8212; I looked like a freak the rest of that day because I could not stop sniffing my sweetly softened hand (coconut, avocado oil, sea salt&#8230;mmm).  Bought the shampoo, but now, NOW I need conditioner!  It’s one of those If You Give a Mouse a Cookie situations, ya know?  Can you help me?</p>

<p>American Cream, $10-$30.  <a href="http://www.lushusa.com" target="_blank">www.lushusa.com</a></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>  Last year around this time of the summer, my scruffy rescue dog Enzo lost all feeling in his back legs due to intervertebral disc disease. I thought he was going to die because we couldn’t afford his surgery, but friends, family, and wonderful people I’ve never even met helped us pay for his care and Enzo made a nearly complete recovery. This dog dude has been through a lot &#8212; abuse, he was hit by a car, and then he lost his legs and regained them.  I would very much like <strong>a 30s style cartoon</strong> of my fuzzy buddy to remind me how much we’ve both survived and that even when you’ve had a hard life, it’s possible to find kindness, care, and cuddles.</p>

<p>Tattoo, lots of $$$.  Maybe at Lansing’s Eclectic Tattoo Shop?  </p>
<p><strong>5.</strong>  Things I need to battle my anxiety and feel calm? <strong>Therapy and yoga</strong>. Things that are expensive? Therapy and yoga. With therapy at least my health insurance helps me out, but with yoga I typically need to shell out the cash for the amazing exercise and good feelings. Gift certificates to feel goods, please. I will be less cranky in your presence, so it’s really a gift for all of us.</p>

<p>Yoga punch card or monies toward the yogs, all donations welcome.  </p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> When I go to yoga, well, I sweat. Like, I make puddles and slide around and sprout drops of water all over my bod. For my safety and honestly just to help me be less gross, I would like one of these here <strong>Yogitoes towels</strong>. They come in an array of bright colors (there’s even a rainbow one!) and they keep you dry and secure on your mat. Added bonus: I’ll look like a total yoga person when I get one of these &#8212; it’s serious gear. . . maybe I’m just hip and not a sweaty mess. Just maybe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The needle carves into the skin.  It stabs deep into those cutaneous layers you learned about in science class and lays the ink down.  Bits of blood bubble up and out.  First comes the awful sensation &#8212; a shard of glass dragging across you &#8212; then, the “why am I doing this?,” followed by the warm intoxicating whirring of hot pain.  Steadily vibrating, the pen darkens each line.  The artist dips into her tiny buckets of paint.  Your jaw clenches and you breathe through your teeth.  You feel alive.  Your skin is both map and terrain.</em></p>
<p>I got my first tattoo after my cousin Irene died.  Two blue swallows flying on my back, partly traditional in style (meaning of the old-school sailor look) and partly old-timey cartoonish.  You see the traditional in the simple forms and color scheme.  You see the cartooning in the birds’ button toes, their eyes shaped like little pies with a slice cut out.  In sailing culture, swallow tattoos recognize and commemorate the milestones of the journeyer &#8212; one who travels far from home and comes back again.  One who is both anchored and free.  The bird in ink marks the number of miles, how far one has gone, tallying the math in bodily hieroglyphics. </p>
<p>Irene was/is my cousin.  A diminutive Mexican woman with soft stubby fingers and eyebrows drawn on in fawn pencil.  She lived the spare life of a nun &#8212; if nunneries allowed drinking, smoking and soap opera watching after daily mass.  Raised by my grandmother and great aunt, she was/is bound to our family more closely than the bloodlines express.   She showered me with gifts—toys in those plastic bubbles from quarter machines, packets of sugar-water in wax soda bottles, jokes written on napkins tucked away in her purse.  These things were precious tiny treasures.   Small like me, the child, and her, the teeny old lady, these trinkets bespoke an inversely huge care.  A woman with nothing always had time and money to give me little somethings.  Always, always, without fail. </p>
<p>Everything in Irene’s  tiny apartment was brown and beige, dusty-colored and small as if to forever remind one of the Depression she lived through.  One spot of blue perched above her chair always caught my eye: a jewel-eyed turquoise ceramic bird, beak smiling toward the sky, a counterpoint to the crucifixes and woe-eyed idols protecting each wall.  When she died it was the only thing of hers that I wanted. </p>
<p><em>In the tattooing you’re perforated.  You sit with an artist and (re)make and (re)build and (re)situate yourself.</em> </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7721" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/10/skin-writing/heart-2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/heart.png" data-orig-size="341,556" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="heart" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/heart.png?w=184" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/heart.png?w=341" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/heart.png?w=183&#038;h=300" alt="heart" title="heart" width="183" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7721" /> I wear my heart on my sleeve, El Corazon in image and text on my arm.  The veiny center of this heart is the interstate highway I traveled so many times.  The artistic style is borrowed from a Mexican Bingo card &#8212; a kitschy reminder of childhood, place, and play.  I’ve written my (New)Mexicanness there where my white skin forgot to write it.  Home and family, humor and beauty.  A choice long in the making, this tattoo is my favorite and feels the most mine.  People want to know what it means.  They stop me wanting to look more closely. </p>
<p><em>The art is a wound you wear on your arm, your back.  It bleeds, exudes, scabs-over.  Your skin prickles and itches.  Sprouting &#8212; something is emerging.  You gently wash it and protect it &#8212; why aren’t we always this careful with ourselves?  With others?</em></p>

Resting at the dock in folds of fabric, her hair extends in such a way that her waves become the sea.  This ink came on a whim.  Sometimes I think it’s ugly and completely wrong.  Why didn’t I think about it longer? But I did this, I craved this, and I can’t deny it.  This image and my ambivalence toward it represents the me behind the thoughtful, respectful , perfect heart.  Here, is the restless loner.  The meek(?) little girl covered in tattoos.  The ever-attractive ruiner of things.  The waiter, the worrier (warrior?), the lazy dreamer. </p>
<p><em>Some of the pain you control.  Some of the pain you get used to.  All of the pain pours into the gestalt of the inscription.</em> </p>
<p>I’ve been told I’ve destroyed my “temple,” marred a God-made, God-given thing.  Tongues have tsked their spit at my beautiful back, my altar to Irene and myself.  Some only began to see me when the pictures appeared, as though my presence only became real when colored in.  A few know that the pictures and the colors and the pain and the art have been there all along &#8212; that I am written and I write myself. </p>
<p><em>After the skin has healed, you’ll get that urge for the needle’s bite &#8212; that feeling, that sealing &#8212; again and again and again and again.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PEOPLE!</p>
<p>It is my birthday.</p>
<p>For the past few months, inspired largely by my the desire to not be huffing and puffing my way through my Friday evening softball sessions, I have acquired some really fabulous habits (an addiction to running on the elliptical at the Y, uber-healthy eating, tracking my activity and food intake) and dropped some not so fabulous habits (eating out for lunch, consuming too many lattes, indulging in junk food, boozing, talking myself out of working out).</p>
<p>The results are pretty spectacular. I’m in the shape of my life, and I am positively chomping at the bit to take the field the moment the snow melts off the infield.</p>
<p>In the polar opposite of the spirit of Lent (which, as a Catholic <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/01/miguel-miguel-ela/">like Miguel Cabrera</a> I am celebrating), here’s a list of things I don’t want to give up.</p>
<p>What I want for Opening Day:</p>
<table>

<td> 1. New cleats. Mine have seen the beginning and end of 8 or 9 seasons now, which is at least 7 more than I expected to get when I bought them at Dunham’s for like 20 bucks to replace the Nikes that had replaced the white Reeboks that got me through high school. Something like these beauties would do nicely.</td>

<td>2. A bat. My coach says my power will be unreal when I’m swinging a bat that’s got some pop to it. Now, people, I am 5 foot 2. According to various lame charts and whatnot on the interwebs, I am supposed to be slinging a hammer more appropriate for a toddler than Albert Pujols. But I didn’t earn the nickname Ryan Howard from my favorite teammate by slugging with a small, or even proportioned, bat. I’ll take this in a 34 inch, 28 ounce, please.</td>

This year, how about switching out my normal navy and black for something a little more … 70s?</td>

<p>Happy birthday to me, pals. I’m skipping the cupcakes and hitting the trails, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
