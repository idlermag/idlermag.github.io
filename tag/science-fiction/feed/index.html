										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Shochiku studio released <em>The X From Outer Space</em> in 1967, they likely had high hopes for their own successful <em>kajiu eiga</em> (giant monster movie) series, much like Toho Studios’ famed <em>Godzilla</em> (1954), which by then already had seven profitable features.  Unfortunately for Shochiku, their monster Guilala failed to have the even modest success of Gamera, another of the giant monsters riding Godzilla’s spiky coattails.  For one thing, the tongue twister “Guilala” probably didn’t help.</p>
<p>Despite poor Guilala’s lack of popular appeal, the film that introduced him fascinates in its own right as an example of the craftsmanship of mid-century Japanese genre film.  An unscientific survey of comments on YouTube suggests that <em>The X From Outer Space</em> is considered a “so bad it’s good” style cult film, but I find it a good deal more interesting and well-made than many of the later Godzilla films, which are mostly repetitive, “monster of the year” wrestling matches between two men in rubber suits. To be fair, perhaps Guilala would have suffered the same fate as his compatriots Godzilla and Gamera, had <em>The X From Outer Space</em> succeeded.  After all, the first Godzilla film is probably the only masterpiece the <em>kajiu eiga</em> genre produced.  </p>
<p><em>The X From Outer Space</em> is only really a <em>kaiju eiga</em> in the second half of the film.  The first half of the film is a “voyage through space” narrative, similar to something like <em>Destination Moon</em> (1950) or <em>Rocketship X-M</em> (1950).  The crew of the AAB Gamma is dispatched to Mars to investigate the disappearance of previous expeditions, the cause of which, we are told “may be UFOs.”  The ship’s crew is diverse, made up of both Japanese and Americans, and they are directed from Earth by Dr. Berman and Dr. Kato.  In this respect, <em>The X From Outer Space</em> seems to emerge from the same Cold War liberal consensus as <em>Star Trek</em>, imagining space travel as a global, international venture undertaken for the benefit of humanity &#8212; though perhaps to attribute such sentiment to <em>The X From Outer Space</em> gives it the benefit of too much doubt.  </p>

<p>AAB Gamma experiences a fairly standard set of space travel film complications &#8212; a threatening UFO which resembles a glowing pastry, an ill crewmember who endangers the others, and a brief pit stop at the international moon station, which sets in motion a lamely conceived love triangle between Capt. Sano, ship’s scientist Lisa, and Michiko, a staff member at the moon station who holds a torch for the good captain.  The moon stop does provide a distraction for a kitsch-minded audience, however, as we get a full dose of the film’s mid-60s space age production design. </p>

<p>After replacing the ill crew member, the AAB Gamma blasts back into space, and once again encounters the UFO, which this time deposits a sticky, weblike substance onto the ship, attaching a glowing orb which, we later learn, is an egg containing Guilala.  The UFO has apparently mistaken the AAB Gamma for a mate.  The crew of the ship removes the glowing orb, for science, and naturally return it to Earth for study.  Predictably, the orb opens and Guilala escapes, grows to monstrous size at tremendous speed, and proceeds to attack power stations across Japan, feeding on the energy.  </p>
<p>At this point, the film becomes less interesting than during the “voyage through space” first half.  This is largely because the plot then follows the general formula of the kaiju eiga: Guilala threatens destroy a major urban area (as usual, Tokyo), the standard efforts of the military fail to cease his rampage, and the main characters stand around discussing said rampage until they discover a scientific way of destroying the monster.  The mise-en-scene feels familiar as well:  Guilala is clearly a man in a suit, smashing small model buildings, and matte shots allow the rubber terror to menace fleeing Japanese civilians.  Still, the entire thing is charmingly lo-fi, and demonstrates a level of special effects craftsmanship entirely lost in the digital age.  Perhaps my greater interest in the first half is a result of its leisurely pace and lack of urgency or clear direction, which enables a contemporary audience to appreciate the production design and effects.   </p>

<p>My objection to calling <em>The X From Outer Space</em> merely a laughable B-movie is that clear care was put into making the film, even if it aspires to be no more than a standard genre offering.  Consider the film’s repeated use of graphic matches.  Although it’s not entirely clear whether the filmmakers intend for us to make a comparison in using the device, its repetition seems a clear indicator of an aesthetic sensibility at work.  Finally, the soundtrack to the film is absolutely tremendous, featuring laidback, lounge-pop 60s music mixed with science fiction effects (sadly, no theremin, which fell out of popular use by this time), matching the film’s space-age optimism, though it does undercut the threat Guilala is supposed to represent.  To be fair, he was never that threatening anyway.  </p>
<p><em>The X From Outer Space</em> is dated as hell, and never once reaches the poetry of the original Godzilla (though few films do).  But it has enough idiosyncrasy to recommend it. I’ve read that a sequel was produced in 2008, but given the state of contemporary Japanese pop culture, I think I’ll skip it.  I prefer the charm of the 60s incarnation.      </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago I read the sci-fi/fantasy/comedy <em>Good Omens</em> by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. The plot revolves around the search for the Anti-Christ, a young boy living in England. An angel and a demon are determined to work together to prevent the apocalypse because after all of their centuries living in our world they have quite grown to like it, they even like humans a little bit. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse need to find the boy as well so they can get the ball rolling on ending the world as we know it. Other people involve themselves in the search as well, some seeking to end the world, some to prolong its existence.  </p>

They told me it was his writing style that I was enjoying and if I planned on reading either of the authors I should read Gaiman. No one mentioned giving Terry Pratchett a try.</p>
<p>I loved it. It was funny and light and definitely something I could read again and find new details that would entertain me. I actually had trouble not rereading it immediately. I usually don’t laugh out loud while reading books but this one had me shaking with laughter. I would read random sentences or paragraphs aloud to my husband just to have someone to share the humor with. </p>
<p>The book was more than just light fiction, too. The characters were very well written &#8212; there was quite the cast but each individual held their own. While it is meant to be humorous, and succeeds quite well, it was good fiction too. I might place Christopher Moore and Tom Holt squarely in the goofy sci-fi/fantasy column, but <em>Good Omens</em> had that little something more. It wasn’t just silly for the sake of being silly, it was a good story told in a light-hearted fashion.</p>
<p>After my love affair with <em>Good Omens</em> was over, I bought <em>American Gods</em> and <em>Anansi Boys</em>, both by Neil Gaiman. Then I pretty much forgot about them until a few weeks ago. <em>Good Omens</em> was not fresh in my mind when I started <em>American Gods</em>, which is probably for the best. If the writing style in <em>Good Omens</em> was supposed to be Gaiman’s, the humor was all Pratchett’s. I’m sure that neither is really true. The two writers collaborated on the novel and there is no way something so cohesive and well done could have been achieved if both men didn’t have a similar sense of humor. But if no one had told me who wrote <em>American Gods</em> I’m not sure I would have thought the same author was involved in both projects.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say the book isn’t good. I really like it. The main character, Shadow, is well written. I want only good things to happen to him. I pity him a little more than I would like to, but shit keeps going down and he gets swept up in so much bad stuff that it’s hard not to feel bad for the guy. The gist of the plot is this: the old gods that people brought to American when they came here are dying. No one worships them and they are fading away. Some have adapted to a smaller life and eke out a living, but some are angry and want to take back the power they once had. The new gods in America are technology and media, television and highways. A battle is coming and Shadow gets caught up in the middle.</p>
<p>At a few points the narrative style is slow and I ended up setting the book aside even though I wanted to read more, I just needed a break from the description of everything. I always wanted to know what would happen next, but I didn’t always want to slog through pages and pages to get there. The last hundred pages or so pick up and while reading the ending I only put the book down when I had to, always a plus. The beginning had pulled me in quickly but I have to say the middle lagged, a lot. Maybe I was expecting too much. I thoroughly enjoyed <em>Good Omens</em> and while I knew that <em>American Gods</em> was a serious book, I thought it might share some properties with the book that got me interested in Gaiman in the first place. There is a large cast of characters and they are skillfully woven together. I never mistake one for another and I haven’t had to go back to figure out who someone was when they reappeared later in the book. The writing is excellent and the story idea is fantastic, I’m just not sure all those people were right in shoving Pratchett out of the way to place the spot light solely on Gaiman.</p>
<p>In doing a little research for this column I found that Pratchett not only did more of the actual writing, Gaiman was working on his <em>Sandman</em> series at the time so it just happened to work out that Pratchett wrote more words, but his most famous series of books, the <em>Discworld</em> series is satirical. So why did everyone who found out I was reading <em>Good Omens</em> recommend the more serious minded author over the guy who has written dozens of comic fantasy books. Discworld is a flat planet resting on the backs of four elephants that balance on a giant turtle. How is this not the guy you point someone to when they are reading <em>Good Omens</em>, a book where the baby Anti-Christ is given to the wrong parents at a hospital? </p>
<p>I certainly don’t dislike Neil Gaiman. I’ll read <em>Anansi Boys</em>, the kind of sequel to <em>American Gods</em>. It turns out I already own <em>Neverwhere</em>, another popular Gaiman book, so I am all set on being a fan of his. I’m just disappointed that I came to him because of a collaboration with someone I will probably end up liking even better. If I had known that Tori Amos was referencing Gaiman in &#8220;Tear in Your Hand&#8221; (&#8220;If you need me, me and Neil&#8217;ll be hangin&#8217; out with the dream king. Neil says hi by the way&#8221;) I feel like I would have known what to expect from him more. </p>
<p>I think I will try out the <em>Discworld</em> series next though. And maybe I can be the lone voice telling people that if they like <em>Good Omens</em> they should try Terry Pratchett out next. Neil Gaiman is getting enough love already</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a historian, I&#8217;m a sucker for time travel novels. To go back in time and observe is a historian&#8217;s dream. (We&#8217;ll never know, though, even if we were there, exactly what people were thinking and feeling at any given time in history. People are unfathomable. Some things will always be guesses.) In some time travel novels the travelers are scientists, historians, hunters, tourists, or everyday people sucked back in time by a portal. But in my favorite time travel novels, the travelers are immortals.</p>
<p>Kage Baker&#8217;s <em>Company</em> books are some of the best time travel novels ever written, using the genre to talk about memory, time, history, change, and the limits of infinity. Baker, who died too young in 2010, wrote 8 novels and 2 short story collections about immortal time travelers and their shadowy employer, Dr. Zeus Inc. also known simply as “The Company.” It&#8217;s best to start at the beginning, with <em>In the Garden of Iden</em> (1997).</p>
<p>The backstory is that time travel and immortality were invented contemporaneously, in the 24<sup>th</sup> Century. But there are caveats. Time travel is dangerous to normal humans, who can only go into the past and then return to the present, and cannot take anything back from the past with them. And the immortality process only works on children. The Company, then, for money as well as for unspecified nefarious purposes, goes back as far as possible in time and rescues children, starting with Neanderthal children, who would otherwise have died, using nanotechnology to turn them into immortal cyborg operatives. The operatives work through the millenia in real time, with retirement and rewards promised once they reach the 24<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>The heroine of most of the books, the Botanist Mendoza, was rescued from a Spanish Inquisition dungeon and drafted into the Company. Her first mission, in <em>In the Garden of Iden</em>, is to take genetic samples from plants in an 16<sup>th</sup> century English nobleman&#8217;s garden. The teenage Mendoza dislikes the mission (indeed, all cyborgs are raised to hate the past from the perspective of their prudish 24<sup>th</sup> century employers.) But as she learns to do her work she also learns that there is much she hasn&#8217;t been told about humans and human life in history. The book is a great Elizabethan historical novel whose main characters happen to be immortal cyborgs. Of course, Mendoza falls tragically in love. But why do people identical to her lover show up in the future in the other novels?</p>
<p>The work of the Company is to save cultural materials that would otherwise have been destroyed, such as the Library of Alexandria, or various extinct botanical species, to sell in the 24<sup>th</sup> century. Operatives also save important papers in a long scene set during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. This is actually a common trope of time travel books. The idea that objects destroyed in their own time can be moved to the future without upsetting the continuum is a saving revelation in, for instance, Connie Willis&#8217; time travel books. In Baker&#8217;s books, it&#8217;s a commercial proposition. Company operatives hide items in Company caches to last out the millenia till they can be found in the present and sold.</p>
<p>Baker was a Californian and an enthusiast of California history, and it shows. Mendoza is sent to 16<sup>th</sup> century and 19<sup>th</sup> century California as well as to a 150,0000 BCE Catalina Island. In <em>Mendoza in Hollywood</em> (2000) the bored cyborgs watch <em>Intolerance</em>. (Luckily an operative who had been in Babylon is there to point out inaccuracies.)</p>
<p>Company operatives from the far past know all about the future &#8212; up to a particular date in 2355 known as the Silence, when all information stops. What happens then? You&#8217;ll have to read the books. (Hint: the last book is called <em>The Sons of Heaven</em>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book you reread is different from the book you read the time before. You change. Your reading strategies change. The book expands to fill more of your life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about books I love, that I reread because I love both the experience of reading them and the experience of having read them deeply and as part of the rhythms of my life. But I don&#8217;t reread the same way every time, and I reread each book differently. My first few readings of many books usually conform to the genre reader archetype: I read for plot, to find out what happens, and then I reread to find out what I missed, to dwell on beautiful sentences and clear up confusion engendered by reading so fast. But my subsequent rereads are idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>Since I discovered the books of the amazing sf writer Samuel R. Delany in my teens, I&#8217;ve read my favorites several dozen times. As a younger reader I liked the shorter, more tightly plotted novels he wrote in the 1960s, in preference to his shaggy, more theoretical later books, with their uneasy sexualities and ambiguous endings.</p>
<p>Since it was one of those early favorites, I&#8217;ve reread <em>Nova</em>, his 1968 Holy-Grail-in-Space story, more times than I can count. The book starts with a wonderful set piece in a port on Triton, where we are introduced to Mouse, who plays a synesthetic instrument, the “sensory syrynx;” Katin, the character who is writing a novel and annoys me because he is so relatable and I see the bright-eyed college kid part of myself in him; and the brilliant, damaged Captain Lorq Von Ray, who is recruiting a crew for his trip into the sun on the <em>Roc</em>. The worldbuilding is great: everyone has plugs in their wrists and neck, to plug into ships and machines so that everyone can do actual work with their bodies. A scene takes place at a galactic museum. It is a wonderful, rich space opera story about history and writing and bodies and blindness and empires rising and falling.</p>
<p>But what I forget because of the way I reread is that this grail quest book is also a story of a bitter rivalry between the Von Ray and Prince and Ruby Red, owners of a huge company that makes spaceship machinery and controls mines of a Macguffin energy source, Illyrion. The story is told episodically with flashbacks to connections and clashes between the Reds and Von Ray &#8212; and Von Ray&#8217;s doomed romance with Ruby. But I always skip the flashbacks, because Prince Red is cruel and violent and Ruby is duplicitous, and I care more about Mouse and Katin than about the clash of empires. So the epic story, upon multiple rereads, has become for me a story about very different people brought together on a ship, and their picaresque, important travels across the galaxies talking about technology and writing and life and history.</p>
<p>But because I skip the Prince Red parts doesn&#8217;t mean I just reread a few pages or scenes I like. I reread probably two-thirds of the book. The parts I love don&#8217;t make sense without the experience of having (mostly) read up to that point in the book. The process of reading matters. And the parts I love have a different valance when they&#8217;re less inflected by the cruelties of Von Ray&#8217;s youth. Often the books I reread are different than on the first read for more subtle reasons, paragraphs that suddenly jump out, motivations that are suddenly revealed. But when I reread <em>Nova</em>, given the parts I skip, I literally read a different book.  And I love that book too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“If you like <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> then you’ll love <em>Outcasts</em>!” At least that’s what the producers of <em>Outcasts</em> are probably hoping you’ll say. Unfortunately at only 8 episodes long, <em>Outcasts</em> is a mere shadow of the show it aspires to be.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Plot</strong><br />
Plots are hard! I know, it’s okay. The home planet of humans has been destroyed but a few scattered ships make it out alive and try to settle on a world they don’t know much about all the while a nefarious force is tracking them down. So, is this the plot of seasons 2/3 of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> or the plot of <em>Outcasts</em>. It’s both, silly!</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Character</strong><br />
<em>BSG</em>’s Gaius Baltar is the unique combination of scientist, traitorous political officer, and religious leader. <em>Outcasts</em>’ Julius Berger is the unique combination of scientist, traitorous political officer, and religious leader.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Actor</strong><br />
Star power! <em>BSG</em> fan favorite Jamie Bamber appears briefly in <em>Outcasts</em>. He’s on the show long enough to get people who like <em>BSG</em> to start watching <em>Outcasts</em>, but not so long that casual viewers would start to pick up on how similar <em>Outcasts</em> is to <em>BSG</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Plot Element</strong><br />
Cylons: We created them and they turned on us so we tried to kill them and now they’re pseudo-humans who would like to see us destroyed, but we may have to try to live together. Advanced Cultivars: We created these pseudo-humans who turned on us after we tried to kill them and who would like to see us destroyed, but we may have to try to live together.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Twists</strong><br />
One of the pseudo humans is amongst us unbeknownst to even her! Gaius/Julius is a traitor! There may be something more mystical going on that we can or want to understand!</p>
<p><em>Outcasts</em> is a decent show especially if you’re jonesing for something more with <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> off the air. Just set your expectations appropriately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Farscape</em> was why my spouse and I bought a TiVo. It was a show we discovered not long after we got married and that we were soon watching faithfully. But we discovered after our babe was born in 2001 that live television watching wasn&#8217;t compatible with baby minding, and we rediscovered the unreliabilty of taping shows on a VCR. We couldn&#8217;t do without Moya and her crew, and so we bought a first-generation TiVo, along with a lifetime subscription to its services. We&#8217;ve been proselytizing the joys of TiVo ever since (we&#8217;ve upgraded to a recent model and have hacked that to increase its memory). But <em>Farscape</em> had disappeared from our lives for a while. It went off the air, and although I&#8217;m pretty sure we own it on DVD, I don&#8217;t tend to remember to watch my DVDs. But with its appearance on Netflix Instant, nothing can come between me and Ka D&#8217;Argo again.</p>
<p>What blew me away when we first started watching the series was how far removed it was from the imaginative and visual universe of <em>Star Trek</em>. There&#8217;s no crew of brethren searching for scientific knowledge, no utterly foreign aliens, no discrete episodes with uplifting morals. It&#8217;s a sprawling soap opera in which the crew of the living spaceship constantly argue and jostle for dominance and reveal secrets and longings and shifting alliances. The villains &#8212; and, oh the evil chasing Creighton and Aeryn and the others is evil indeed &#8212; are also complex and sometimes allies in the moment, even while never to be trusted.</p>
<p>The best way in, if you haven&#8217;t seen the show before, is to start at the beginning. But be forewarned: the series was cancelled abruptly, so what should have been a cliffhanger was, for many years, the ending. You&#8217;ll be able to watch beyond the fourth series to the 2004 <em>The Peacekeeper Wars</em> mini-series that tried to wrap things up more equitably. But that sudden ending was the biggest betrayal I&#8217;ve come across in television. I&#8217;m still bitter about it. I&#8217;m actually a bit reluctant to return to the show with the full force of love I felt for it before. I&#8217;ll dip my toes in once and a while, but I can&#8217;t immerse myself anymore. You should, though. Your heart won&#8217;t get broken, I promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once you&#8217;ve failed at everything, what next?</p>
<blockquote><p>**COURANE, Sandor:</p>
<p>You are to be sent as a colonist to the agricultural world of Epsilon Eridani, Planet D. You will be part of an integrated farming community. Your future successes and failures will thus be of no consequence to the community at large here on Earth, yet you will be placed in an environment which will remand much of you and reward you with peace and satisfaction.**</p></blockquote>
<p>Since TECT, the machine to which humans had conceded the government of their lives, ordered Sandor Courane into exile on Planet D (which the colonists inevitably called Home), he had no choice but to go. And on Home, Sandor found respite from his failures on Earth (TECT had mercifully given him 3 chances: as a basketball player, a science fiction writer, and a factory worker) and a community whose work filled him with pride. But Sandor also discovered that on Home, there were two types of colonists: patients infected with a terrible fatal neurological disorder, and prisoners to take care of them as they forget everyone and everything they once loved. What caused D syndrome? Why would TECT let this happen?</p>
<p>George Alec Effinger&#8217;s short novel <em>The Wolves of Memory</em> (1981) is a neglected small masterpiece by an under-read SF writer. Effinger is best known for his vivid, violent novels about a detective in an sfnal desert town based on New Orleans, starting with <em>When Gravity Fails</em> (1987). He died young, in 2002. <em>The Wolves of Memory</em> is a striking meditation on technology and empathy.</p>
<p>The key relationship in the book is between Courane and TECT. TECT (who is the slightest bit dated, since characters communicate with it only through typing or speaking to terminals) is characterized with biting wit, an all-controlling computer that is constantly exasperated and angered by human frailty. TECT is nosy and capricious in the guise of protecting humanity from its failings. And Sandor is a shlubby everyman that Effinger used in other stories; you can find <em>Wolves</em> in a recent collection of Courane stories called <em>A Thousand Deaths</em>. In <em>Wolves</em> Sandor becomes a stable, kind part of D&#8217;s farming community, but finds himself wholly incapable of finding a cure for D syndrome, saving any of his friends from death, and remembering the things he needs to remember: a failure just like he was on Earth. TECT is generally very sarcastic with Sandor, but maybe TECT doesn&#8217;t have everything under control like the humans think it does. And as Courane loses his memory, what really happened, and what TECT is really planning, becomes more and more unclear.</p>
<p>Read <em>The Wolves of Memory</em> for a book that, with humor, critiques human relationships with technology, and makes us care about TECT&#8217;s pawns and even, maybe, TECT itself.</p>

I spent my childhood reading and rereading her books, which, as British imports, I could never find for sale. I even retyped a significant portion of one of my favorites, <em>Archer&#8217;s Goon</em>, so I could have a copy handy when I needed to reread it.</p>
<p>One of Jones&#8217; books always eluded me. I found it once at a library but never saw a copy again. As I grew older I was haunted by images from the book &#8212; a skeletal ship, a man chained to a rock, a girl with a withered arm &#8212; and, having forgot the title, began think that I&#8217;d dreamed it rather than read it. It was <em>The Homeward Bounders</em>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9503" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/17/walking-the-bounds/homewardbounders/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homewardbounders.jpg" data-orig-size="286,432" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HomewardBounders" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homewardbounders.jpg?w=199" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homewardbounders.jpg?w=286" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homewardbounders.jpg?w=198&#038;h=300" alt="The Homeward Bounders" title="HomewardBounders" width="198" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-9503" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homewardbounders.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300 198w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homewardbounders.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/homewardbounders.jpg 286w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /> <em>The Homeward Bounders</em> is a book about not finding home. Jamie narrates the story; he is twelve and is speaking into a machine left behind by <em>Them</em>. (<em>They</em> are always in italics.) Jamie grows up in late 19<sup>th</sup> century London, the son of a grocer, exploring the city and getting into trouble. He stumbles upon <em>Them</em> playing a wargame, and, after consulting the rules, they decide, rather than killing him, to throw him onto the bounds.</p>
<p>This is the heart of the book, even though it&#8217;s only about 50 pages. Jamie ends up first in a world with nomadic herders, and many others that blur together for him as they do for us. He stays until the bounds call him, which they do sooner or later, and send him somewhere else. He is a Homeward Bounder &#8212; the rules are that if he ends up back at Home, he can stay. Other rules &#8212; he can&#8217;t die. It&#8217;s lonely. It doesn&#8217;t end.</p>
<p>Luckily, Jamie comes to a boundary that drops him into the sea. He is picked up the Flying Dutchman &#8212; his ship has got rid of anchors, to show that they have no hope &#8212; and dropped on an island where he meets a man in chains (who we know must be Prometheus, but Jamie doesn&#8217;t). Jamie finally meets other Homeward Bounders (a young woman exiled from her own world and a demonhunter), finally makes plans to defeat <em>Them</em>, and finally loses hope.</p>
<p>Diana Wynne Jones&#8217; books are often madcap and hilarious, but not this one. There is humor, but the real triumph of the book is a flawless evocation of some of the bleaker moods: loneliness, hopelessness, dark irony, the feeling of being home everywhere and nowhere. I trust Jones, and I trust that any story she tells me will be important. Until I picked up <em>The Homeward Bounders</em>, I didn&#8217;t know I needed to read a story about how a boy can become an anchor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always firmly believed that, deep down, people like to be corrected when they are so wrong about something that it borders on embarrassment. Mind you, I say “people,” and not “friends,” for reasons that should be immediately self-evident. However, as one of the newest contributors to <em>The Idler</em>, I feel I have a responsibility to inform my colleagues that they are all unquestionably, irredeemably and thoroughly incorrect in the running debate about just who is the best Doctor.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">Matt Smith</a> is a very fine Doctor, better than I had expected in fact. <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Christopher Eccleston</a>, <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/04/kindness-and-fury/">David Tennant</a>, fantastic both. But the one that stands head and shoulders (and quite a mop of hair) above the other Doctors is none of these, or for that matter, any Who had come before. The best Doctor, running across our television screens on a mission through time and space, is, in fact, Dr. Mrs. The Doctor: the often mysterious, ever sharp-witted, frequently dangerous, and classically stunning River Song, played by actress Alex Kingston.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9462" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/11/spoilers-sweetie/riversong1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/riversong1.jpg" data-orig-size="620,380" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RiverSong1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/riversong1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/riversong1.jpg?w=620" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/riversong1.jpg?w=640" alt="River Song" title="RiverSong1"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9462" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/riversong1.jpg 620w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/riversong1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/riversong1.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>Point of clarification: I’m a relatively new recruit to <em>Doctor Who</em> fandom. My husband’s giggling like a child over every Dalek appearance has generally fallen on deaf ears (I wish!) for years. I have been in the room for more episodes than I can claim to have watched, ever finding a comic book to read, web to surf or cookbook to page through while some madman slides across the TV screen with a vibrating piece of hardware that I barely know how to use in non-vibrating form. But all that disinterest evaporated the moment River Song walked into the library and bid hello to her sweetie for the first (and last) time.</p>
<p>I can’t say precisely what it was that made me toss <em>Bridge for Dummies</em> aside and take notice those first moments, but I have a pretty good idea. Here was a confident, beautiful woman who clearly knew more about the Doctor than the Doctor knew about her. That alone placed her far above in my mind any traditional companion, each of whom is clearly present firstly for the purpose of exposition and viewer projection. And then it was revealed: River Song is no run-of-the-mill companion. She knew the Doctor’s name. THE DOCTOR’S NAME. You don’t come across that information by chance. No, this lady was important. She’d been through many adventures with the Doctor (most of which we’ve presumably already seen now &#8212; drat) and beamed happily that they were all ahead of him at this point in his timeline. And then she died. Good Lord. I was hooked.</p>

<p>Two people living their lives in reverse, never traveling through time in the same order, is so beautifully romantic it should be a movie (or at least an acclaimed novel). So, yes, we’ve seen this trope before in both iterations of <em>The Time Traveler’s Wife</em>, but never with so much agency for that titled character. Dr. Song (as in life, I must acknowledge the title, for it is not easily acquired) doesn’t just sit around waiting for the next time her bow-tied beau will show up to whisk her away. Sure, she may need a quick rescue from time-to-time, but carving coordinates into the side of an ancient mountain with her trademark salutation “Hello, Sweetie!” isn’t exactly fainting at a villain’s moustache twirl. She’s ballsy enough to shoot herself out an airlock with no oxygen and trusts that the Doctor will have gotten her directions. The greater trust, I’d argue, isn’t in the Doctor, though. It’s in her own ingenuity and ability to know exactly what levers to pull in the Doctor’s personality and history to get the maximum desired results.</p>
<p>And that’s nothing compared to the gun-slinging. This scene from the Sixth Series’ &#8220;Day of the Moon&#8221; encapsulates everything about why Dr. Song is close to my heart. She flirts from a position of intellectual strength (and gets the often timid Doctor to flirt along with equal glee) and she polishes off a room of enemies like a 50-year veteran of Laser Tag University.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVVQ0u--mYo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>So, yeah, River Song is brilliant, but why is she a better Doctor than the Doctor?</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>She’s redeemed.</strong> My understanding of the Doctor is that he’s always been a do-gooder. Traveling through time, righting wrongs, helping civilizations evolve &#8212; that’s the Doctor’s schtick. Dr. Song’s past is not that cut-and-dried. I’d rather not get into the minutia of River’s origins in case you, dear reader, are one of the lucky few to not yet have enjoyed them firsthand, but let’s just say they’re murky. She’s in prison for murdering “The best man I’ve ever known” (now who could that be?) but she clearly cares about saving lives and defending the innocent. She’s compassionate and good with all kinds of reasons to not have become either one.</li>
<li><strong>She’s smarter.</strong> Dr. Song almost immediately exhibits more ingenuity in how to do the things the Doctor does, from uses for the sonic screwdriver to how to appropriately pilot the TARDIS. Yes, one could say she has the advantage of hindsight from her point in the Doctor’s history, but let’s be honest about that. The Doctor has lived, at any given point of the current narrative, around one thousand years. You’d think he’d know to take the brakes off when landing by now. That noise doesn’t sound good to me, and I can barely pump my own gasoline.</li>
<li><strong>She’s got more to lose. </strong>Dr. Song can’t regenerate (you’ll see) and doesn’t live forever. She’s human, but still has to emotionally deal with the loss and pain that comes along with being a time-traveler. She’ll have to say goodbye to the people she loves just like the Doctor, and frankly, it seems to me she loves them just a little bit more. Despite all that, she jumps into adventure like every day is her last. No matter what the Doctor claims, he’s pretty sure he’ll be around tomorrow. Ultimately, River knows, someday she won’t. Life doesn’t end well for River, but she puts it all on the line anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dr. Song knows what her worst day is, and it isn’t the day she dies. Neither me, as that was the day I first came across clever, ruthless, amazing River and fell in love with <em>Doctor Who</em>. No, her heartbreaking moment will be “when I&#8217;ll look into that man&#8217;s eyes &#8212; my Doctor &#8212; and he won&#8217;t have the faintest idea who I am.”  Mine is when <em>my</em> Doctor, Dr. Song, disappears forever, the last tale of a finite life told, and I have to go back to my reading material when the TARDIS buzzes in the background.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly fifty years and eleven actors, we have some idea of what makes the Doctor: <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">&#8220;He’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s a bit distant, and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">&#8220;he has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s dangerous &#8212; when the Doctor is around, people die &#8212; but he&#8217;s irresistible, and, in the David Tennant incarnation at least, he&#8217;s a walking broken heart. He&#8217;s the one who has to make all the impossible choices and save the world, even though he may not be able to save you.</p>
<p>After Christopher Eccleston spent a year breathing new life into the Doctor Who francise, and sacrificed himself to save pop singer Billie Piper (a.k.a. Rose Tyler) from a case of terminal omnipotence, David Tennant stepped into the Doctor&#8217;s trainers and travelling coat for a four-year, three-season run as the Tenth and best Doctor. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s run actually starts off a bit slowly, not entirely hitting its stride until halfway through #10&#8217;s second year (and second companion).</p>
<p>In &#8220;Human Nature/The Family of Blood,&#8221; the Doctor and companion Martha Jones hide out in early twentieth century England from a family of intergalactic hunters. In order to keep the family from tracking them, the Doctor has to alter his physiology to become human, and hide his memories and identity in a pocket watch. (It&#8217;s <em>Doctor Who</em>. Believe it or not, it all makes sense in the episode. Mostly.) The family is relentless, but they&#8217;re short-lived, so if the Doctor and Martha can hide for a few months, they&#8217;ll be safe.</p>
<p>While they&#8217;re hiding, however, the Doctor has no idea that he&#8217;s been anything other than John Smith, schoolteacher at a boys&#8217; boarding school. To make things worse, he&#8217;s fallen in love with the school nurse, Joan Redfern. In order to become the Doctor again, John Smith has to give up his existence. In effect, he has to die for the Doctor to live, and since the Family of Blood has found him, the Doctor has to live in order to be able to save the people John Smith loves.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4wziEiE3Vc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>It is, interestingly, a story in which the Doctor is almost entirely absent, even when David Tennant is onscreen, and when the Doctor returns, his return is terrible.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SC0NuBaliLs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>After this episode, David Tennant&#8217;s Doctor is constantly on the edge of not being the Doctor anymore. After defeating fellow Time Lord The Master (the brilliant, manic John Simm) in &#8220;The Last of the Time Lords,&#8221; the Doctor nearly gives up his itinerant existence in order to care for (and imprison) the one being who could actually be a full and equal companion. In &#8220;The Waters of Mars,&#8221; the Doctor abandons Time Lord constraints and attempts to intervene in a fixed point in history &#8212; avert a tragedy without which the human race might never have set out to explore the universe. In &#8220;Journey&#8217;s End,&#8221; the Doctor prevents a full regeneration (and the same sort of identity death that John Smith faced) by shunting his regeneration energy into the creation of a full second self, who isn&#8217;t a Time Lord, isn&#8217;t immortal, and, not coincidentally, end up getting to lead exactly the sort of life the Doctor wishes that he could have, sharing a single lifetime with an equal partner, instead of an eternal series of temporary companions.</p>
<p>Whatever he does, the Tenth Doctor is never able to escape the costs of his actions, and indeed, his very existence. He is always apologizing to the people he cannot save, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQkFNVhppXo" target="_blank">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In some sense, judging whether the Tenth Doctor is the best Doctor isn&#8217;t an entirely fair competition, since, rather unusually for a new Doctor, Tennant inherits a lot of the strongest elements of Eccleston&#8217;s (and Russell T. Davies&#8217;) modern <em>Doctor Who</em> relaunch. <em>Doctor Who</em> isn&#8217;t really known for continuity &#8212; in fact, each regeneration is normally treated as an entirely fresh start &#8212; but the Tenth Doctor benefits from the show&#8217;s willingness to reach back to previous companions and previous Doctors, and to continue to build on the relationships the Tenth Doctor creates. Companions depart and return &#8212; Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, and even Sarah Jane Smith, who traveled with the Third and Fourth Doctors. Every departure is heartbreaking. Every return comes at a cost, and leads both to triumph and further heartbreak.</p>
<p>For all that, in all honesty, I&#8217;m a bit surprised to not find myself fonder of Matt Smith&#8217;s Eleventh Doctor. The current head writer, Steven Moffat is responsible for many of the very best episodes of both the Ninth and Tenth Doctors&#8217; runs, including &#8220;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances,&#8221; the Christopher Eccleston episodes that finally made me a full-on rabid fan of the Doctor, and my absolute favorite episode, &#8220;Blink,&#8221; which really should totally devastate my argument since David Tennant is barely in it.</p>
<p>But the Eleventh Doctor&#8217;s episodes are somehow shallower. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s playfulness with language (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GMkWfpj4s" target="_blank">&#8220;Allons-y! I should say allons-y more often. Allons-y. Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!&#8221;</a>) is transformed into a penchant for silly hats. (I&#8217;ll give you the fez, Matt Smith, but the stetson/bow tie combination is not cool.) Even worse, Moffat somehow steps on his own best ideas. The Weeping Angels, so frightening and unique in &#8220;Blink,&#8221; (&#8220;The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death.&#8221;) are transformed into brutes that just snap your neck.</p>
<p>I will look forward to the new season, especially if it gives Matt Smith a chance to figure out who his Doctor is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/21/showbiz/tv/doctor-who-new-companion-ew/index.html" target="_blank">without Amy Pond</a>. No Doctor who hasn&#8217;t lost a companion is <em>really</em> the Doctor, and that, ultimately, is why the Tenth Doctor has to stand above Nine and Eleven.</p>
