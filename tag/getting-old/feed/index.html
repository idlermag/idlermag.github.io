										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I forget that I’m a grownup. I still feel like I’m only 21. Every now and then, something will remind me that I’m no longer the target audience for Ke$ha’s music. This week I had drinks with someone born in 1990. I get cranky about the music that’s popular—why is it all club music? KIDS THESE DAYS. Most of the time, I’d rather just stay home and read a book with a cold beer, instead of taking all that time to make myself look good enough to compete with the young whippersnappers when I go out.</p>
<p>But it’s not all dentures and rocking chairs. On Saturday night, I went with Charlie to his work holiday party. As an undergraduate, work parties were awkward affairs in the break room, with the background music of a jamming printer and someone mowing the lawn outside of the basement-level windows. We sat as far away from each other as possible to avoid accidentally bumping elbows or knees with someone, staying only long enough to be polite, eat a piece of cake, and get the hell out of there.</p>
<p>Even after I went off to the corporate world, our work Christmas party was held in the back room of a bowling alley. When we came in, we were ushered past the bar, the pool tables, and the bowling lanes, into a tiny, dark room with an apathetic woman tending bar in a stained white shirt. The party budget covered an open bar, some standard fried food, and unlimited cold pizza, but did not cover bowling or pool. Apparently the bowling lanes were just for show. As a fun alternative, we were all forced to sit on Santa’s lap and take photographs. My friends and I went to the bar afterward to forget what had just happened. It was a slight improvement over my previous work parties, but only in the way that a filling is an improvement over a root canal.</p>
<p>But, dear readers, getting older just means learning how to party more effectively. Charlie’s work party was no joke. It was disco themed, but I’m as bad at themes as I am at costumes, so I chose to ignore that and wore an open-backed top with enough cleavage to say that I’m fun but not so much that Charlie’s friends would think I was a hussy.</p>
<p>When we got to the party, we had to wait in line for a bouncer to let us in. A bouncer. That was my first clue that, even though this was held in their office building, this would not be a party in the fluorescent-lit break room with mediocre cake. No it would not. After we checked in and checked our coats, we went straight for the bar, which was already overflowing with pre-mixed drinks, beer, and wine. The building was full of women in short, sequined dresses and men in platform shoes. Tents were set up outside with strings of lights, couches with neon pillows around fire pits, and women in pink costumes handing out rave jewelry and candy. Charlie’s company clearly values their employees more than mine did.</p>
<p>And the food. Let me tell you about the food. In one room was Japanese, in another was fancy vegetable dishes, some sort of strange fish paste that looked like mashed potatoes, gourmet mac and cheese, meatballs, and many other fresh-made things that I was too wide-eyed to really notice. Some party regulars thought it was nothing special, but I was like a fucking country bumpkin at a five-star restaurant. I was mostly too anxious to eat. Food at social events like this always gives me so much anxiety. Why serve gigantic slabs of chicken without knives? Am I supposed to eat it with my fingers? How can I eat this macaroni and cheese with a fork while I’m also trying to carry my drink? Do I have anything in my teeth? Why is everyone else so much more graceful at this sort of thing than I am? In the end, I decided to avoid the potential for screwups entirely and save my appetite for the dessert tent.</p>
<p>Guys, you have never seen a dessert tent like this. It was set up like a set from Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Everything was edible. There was another bar serving champagne floats with lemon sorbet. Big pink lollipops hung from the ceiling. Charlie and I drunkenly cut the line for the chocolate fountain. I chose a cheesecake lollipop (a tiny piece of chocolate-covered cheesecake on a stick) for the fountain, and was too impatient to let the chocolate harden, so I promptly dripped it all over my cleavage, arms, and feet. I found bits of chocolate on me all night long.</p>
<p>Each room had its own bar. Our work parties were all grown up. We closed out the night dancing to a band recreating all the bad pop songs in a room hung with disco balls where hired girls in afro wigs danced on tables. We’re not quite grown up yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I had any illusions about holding on to my youth, they were dispelled by Nintendo’s hoopla surrounding the 25th anniversary of the release of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></p>
<p>(And may I step to the side for a moment and comment on how much I adore the fact that the name of the game is “<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>” and not “<em>Super Mario Brothers</em>”? Mario and Luigi are the original bros, and for an entire generation they were a first bromance. God bless you 8-bit space limitations!)</p>

Pretty, no?</p></div> Sure, a red Wii looks cool, and it’s fab that they’re packaging the console with <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> (although red console buyers will be missing out on <em>Wii Sports Resort</em>, which is pretty fab too), but if you’re old enough to remember playing the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on an 8-bit NES (which I did), you’re just old. Deal with it.</p>
<p>But because nostalgia isn’t the sole province of baby boomers, and because I’ve been working on ways to (slowly) break my children into the vast wonderful world of video games, I downloaded the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> game on the Wii’s Virtual Console several weeks ago. It has been an interesting experiment. A year ago, when the Wii came into the house, the motion-control <em>Wii Sports</em> game had been the girls’ only first-hand exposure to video games, and I remember my amusement when Rabbit (not her real name) tried a demo of the <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> set up on a big-screen TV at Best Buy. It was a revelation to me that she couldn’t quite fathom pushing a button in order to make Mario jump, but insisted on jerking the controller into the air.</p>
<p>I thought for a while that I was going to have a great column about the new generation of motion-control natives, but when I loaded up the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and gave the controller to Rabbit for the first time, the problem didn’t persist. Neither Rabbit nor Bootsy (also not her real name) is very good at <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, but Rabbit is perfectly comfortable pushing buttons to control the game.</p>
<p>In fact, I shouldn’t make too much of the fact that Rabbit isn’t very good at the game, because, in all honesty, I’m not either, and I never was.</p>

The opportunity was too good to pass up. With one fell swoop I turned on my Wii and showed her that what was old was new again. In minutes we were laughing as mushrooms bounced off of boxes and pipes unexpectedly and escaped, and as my mother adjusted to the fact that collecting every coin isn’t quite as important as getting to the end of the level before the timer runs out. For a moment, I got to be a Super Mario expert, finding hidden 1-Ups and secret pipes. Happily, no one seemed to notice or care that I never even made it through Bowser’s first castle.</p>
<p>Because the big secret of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is that it’s hard&mdash;harder than you remember, especially if you haven’t played it in a while. I certainly seemed to have been the odd man out as a child in that I never beat the game, but like most 8-bit side-scrolling platformers, the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is really a game of reflexes and memorization. And there are no save points. If you make a mistake, you generally have to start all over.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that while Mario is an icon for me, and in a lot of ways the game experience I measure other games against, I’ve never really loved the game. I get bored with platformers pretty quickly, and I’ve found that to be true through the years. I’ve been impressed by turns with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, and <em>Little Big Planet</em>, but I’ve given up on all of them sooner or later. They’re each, unique, inventive, and gorgeous to look at, but at some point, I need a game to revolve around more than jumping. I’m getting too old for that shit.</p>
