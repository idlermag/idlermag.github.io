										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we are, just days away from my favorite holiday and I’ve barely even noticed that Halloween is upon us. Life has gotten in the way this year. There has been no time for my nightly veg sessions in front of AMC’s fear fest; no time for the myriad of horror countdowns on the Chiller channel. My wife and I were in the process of house hunting. Now we’re in the process of closing. There’s new software at work for me to deal with. There’s also blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Enough already. You have to make time for the things you love, right? And so, when <em>Rec 2</em> (2009) landed in my mailbox (Courtesy of Qwi-I mean, Netflix) yesterday I resolved to finally take some time out for the <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/01/fall-of-the-living-dead/">subgenre that had started my Halloween obsession</a> all those years ago: zombie films.</p>
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Pet Semetary kid" src="https://i1.wp.com/28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lb3m27jdw71qb857mo1_400.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;You think you can name me Gage and just GET AWAY WITH IT?!&quot;</p></div>
<p>I immediately pulled up the Fear Fest schedule this year and, aside from finding it to be very <em>Halloween </em>(1978) heavy this year (Including <em>Halloween H20 </em>(1998), but suspiciously excluding <em>Halloween: Resurrection </em>(2002), starring Sir Busta Rhymes), I found it to be just as solid as usual. <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> (1967) had already aired, but given the fact that I have three different versions of it on DVD, I wasn’t sweating that too much. I still had <em>Slither</em> (2006) and <em>Pet Semetary</em> (1989) to look forward to. Yes, I realize that <em>Pet Semetary </em>isn’t what one traditionally thinks of as a zombie film, but tell that to the undead kid with the scalpel who wants to play with you.</p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<div class="mceTemp">
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Flight of the living dead" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/planedead.jpg?w=320&#038;h=213" alt="" width="320" height="213" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wanna join the mile die club?</p></div>
<p>Romero’s <em>Diary of the Dead</em> (2007) and <em>Survival of the Dead</em> (2009) were in there as well, but I immediately disregarded them as sad signs of a once great talent now merely going through the motions. Not to mention highlighting his complete lack of understanding with regards to current technology. Seriously, George, a small clan of Irishmen living on a tiny island (not in Ireland, mind you) decide to create a web video to lure people to them? Really? <em>Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane</em> (2007), not a Romero film, also snuck its way into the lineup, continuing the time-honored “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, just put it on a plane” formula.</div>
</div>
<p>And so, armed with <em>Slither</em>, <em>Pet Semetary</em>, <em>Rec 2, </em>and a darkened living room I attempt to recapture my Halloween spirit. Oh, and what’s that Netlfix? You now have the entire first season of AMC’s <em>The Walking Dead</em> streaming? Nicely done. The good news is: I think I’m already good for next year. Having just had a home inspection on our potential new property I noticed that the current residents had a huge bowl of candy on their kitchen counter, just waiting.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If you can watch <em>Night of The Living Dead</em> on an old, 10" black-and-white television, huddled under a tent made from your own bedding, I'd highly recommend you do so. The more intimate the viewing, the better.  In fact, I believe it to be one of those rare horror films that doesn't necessarily benefit from audience participation.  It wants to scare you on a much deeper, more personal level.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>So it&#8217;s officially October and Fall is upon us.  More importantly, Halloween is just around the corner, which has finally given the </em><em>Cinephiles</em><em> an excuse to focus exclusively on horror for an entire month!  We&#8217;ll kick things off with a childhood favorite of mine, George Romero&#8217;s </em>Night of the Living Dead<em>.</em></p>
<p>If you can watch <em>Night of The Living Dead</em> on an old, 10&#8243; black-and-white television, huddled under a tent made from your own bedding, I&#8217;d highly recommend you do so. The more intimate the viewing, the better.  In fact, I believe it to be one of those rare horror films that doesn&#8217;t necessarily benefit from audience participation.  It wants to scare you on a much deeper, more personal level.</p>
<p>The  story is simple:  A young man and woman, brother and sister, stop by a cemetery  to pay respects.  It is eerily quiet.  There are no other mourners (Sometimes a  small budget can be a blessing in disguise).  As the young man teases his  obviously frightened sister with the immortal line, &#8220;They&#8217;re coming to get you  Barbara,&#8221; a shabbily dressed man approaches and attacks her.  Her brother is  killed in the scuffle, forcing her to retreat to a nearby farmhouse where she encounters a small group of people with similar stories. After  discovering a television, not unlike the ideal one I mentioned earlier, they learn from the local news that the recently deceased are &#8220;returning to life and devouring the flesh of their victims.&#8221;  It&#8217;s pretty grim stuff, and having grown up on the camp of &#8220;Channel 20&#8217;s Thriller Double Feature&#8221; I was ill-prepared for the loss of humanity in <em>Night of The Living Dead</em>.  It shook me.  Normal people reduced to mindless, soulless killing machines.  The monsters here were our own friends and family.</p>

As the flames die down, the ghouls  slowly approach and begin tearing at the charred bodies, devouring them part by part, organ by organ.  It&#8217;s a long sequence and it&#8217;s filmed by an unflinching  camera.  Roger Ebert described this transition in his review, stating that the film had gone from being &#8220;delightfully scary about halfway through, and had  become unexpectedly terrifying.&#8221;  And with that, writer/Director George Romero had reinvented the zombie film (More on that later).</p>
<p>Some argue (justly so) that the film&#8217;s sequel, <em>Dawn of The Dead</em> is the superior film.  And while <em>Dawn</em>&#8216;s story is  larger in scope, its social commentary more deliberate and it&#8217;s SFX vastly improved, it&#8217;s hard for me to agree that <em>Dawn</em> is the <em>scarier</em> film.  There&#8217;s something about its predecessor that just sticks with me.  Perhaps it still makes me feel like a scared little kid hiding under his blanket?  Or perhaps it&#8217;s the scene near the end where a little girl kills her own mother with a trowel?  Yeah, that&#8217;ll do it.</p>
