										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On any given night, in any given bar across the globe, one can find a band, onstage, playing the music of another artist. Many years ago I stopped for a drink at a local establishment. Four lads were on stage and as I nursed my drink long since lost to the sands of time, they began to play a song &#8211; a familiar song. It was a Pink Floyd song, but nobody seemed to know or notice what it was. I did. The song was &#8220;Free Four&#8221; from Pink Floyd’s 1971 soundtrack recording for the wacky French film <em>La Vallee</em>. I’ve seen <em>La Vallee</em>; totally strange and wacky and, frankly, kind of boring. Floyd recorded two soundtracks in their early career, one entitled &#8220;Soundtrack from the film More&#8221; and &#8220;Obscured by Clouds,&#8221; the LP that bore this interesting choice of cover. I don’t remember anything else about that band in the bar or their sound, but I will always remember the count in and the faithful rendition of this faded number from the Pink Floyd catalog.</p>

<p>Cover versions are strange things. There really are only two ways to cover a song, good and bad. It is far, far easier to record a bad cover version than a strong cover version. In the mid &#8217;90s Atlantic Records released a disc of Led Zeppelin cover songs. It stunk. Too many songs were too faithful while others were just too wacky to make a difference. It is a fine line, what makes a successful cover version versus an unsuccessful one. Recently I stumbled onto a cover of a Wire song, &#8220;Map Ref. 41°N 93°W&#8221; by the Ann Arbor artist Dykehouse. I love it, absolutely love it. I love the original as well; how can you not love the first three Wire LPs? But this version was slightly different. And I remembered that one of the last recorded bits of music from the always entertaining My Bloody Valentine was a cover of &#8220;Map Ref. 41°N 93°W.&#8221; What I was listening to was a cover version of a cover version! Finding the MBV version showed me the version covered by Dykehouse. Strange that a version of a version was so enjoyable, but it was. It glistens and glimmers and sounds like a wall in the sky. It is tremendous. Of course if the source material was weaker, the cover song may not carry the same heft. I’m not saying that there aren’t great cover songs or that some bands can’t hang when it comes to covers. Yo La Tengo contributes to the WFMU pledge drive in New York by taking listener requests. They’ve released a CD of these versions called <em>Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics</em> wherein they play the music of everyone from T Rex to Yoko Ono. The band also sprinkles choice covers on their discs from quality source material in a quality way. Yet their versions are faithful, filtered through the band’s sensibilities. There is fearlessness in covering someone else’s work. Rarely has there been a sense of artistic fearlessness greater than in the case of Mick Harvey.</p>

<p>How can you describe Mick Harvey to someone who isn’t aware of Mick Harvey? He is an Australian. He is an artist. He was a member of the Birthday Party. He was a member of the Bad Seeds. For the past 30 years he has been synonymous with his Australian counterpart, Nick Cave. Harvey met Cave, as well as the rest of the men who would form the Birthday Party, in the early &#8217;70s. Who were the Birthday Party, you ask? That’s a tough question to answer. I think of them as musical confronters; a strange, isolated hybrid of punk music, filtered through a certain Australian mindset. Theirs was a music of cacophony and confrontation. It was thrilling and terrifying to behold. In 1983, the band split and around the nucleus of Cave and Harvey formed the band Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds. The Bad Seeds continue to this day as a linear, lyrical group driven by Cave’s unique voice, presence, and poetry. Mick Harvey left the Bad Seeds in 2009 after 25 years in the band (30 years if you factor in his time at Cave’s side in the Birthday Party). That is quite the tenure working with one artist. Many would assume that his role was more of a sideman. When you hear about members of a group, you do tend to think that the leader is the one who does the lion&#8217;s share of creating for the group. One tends to forget about the band in the face of the lead singer of a band. Mick Harvey was a multi-instrumentalist and arranger. He was more than a side-man. Harvey recorded and released his first solo record in 1995, mid-way through his Bad Seeds tenure. The record demonstrated Harvey’s artistic fearlessness, and the record featured nothing but the music of Serge Gainsbourg. The record is called <em>Intoxicated Man</em>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qzq7jPpl2SU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I first heard the disc in 1995/1996. I had not yet discovered the music of Serge Gainsbourg on my own. No, I came to the music of Mick Harvey after listening to Nick Cave’s Murder Ballads over and over. I don’t know why I didn’t skin dive deeper into the murky world of the Bad Seeds, but I gravitated towards this solo disc. I bought the disc and its follow up, <em>Pink Elephants</em>, itself another disc of 100% Gainsbourg. Truth be told, I didn’t care for them at the time and quickly sold the discs. I didn’t give them much thought even as I got into the music of Serge Gainsbourg. Or maybe it is the other way around; maybe I got the discs once I got into the music of Gainsbourg. Whatever the time frame of my introduction, the end result was the same: I sold the discs. Y’see, many a time in my life I have rushed into buying something only to listen, grow tired, or not quite get it, only to sell it. What generally happens next takes place over the following years: I catch something from the disc that makes me take another chance and on that last chance I find the beauty in the music I initially missed due to my own ears. David Bowie’s <em>Low</em>, <em>Something Else</em> by the Kinks, and both<em> Pink Elephants</em> and <em>Intoxicated Man</em> all fall into the same realm of rediscovered music. Recently, when my daughter wanted what she calls &#8220;ballet music,&#8221; I put on the <em>Comic Strip</em> collection from Serge Gainsbourg. As I listened, for some reason, I really wanted to hear <em>Intoxicated Man</em>. I took the plunge and downloaded the LPs and began to re-listen to the songs. Instantly I was hooked.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QICYGcDiXKg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>In the realm of covers, these LPs stand alone on their own merit. The arrangements are faithful, which is a 50/50 shot. It even feels like the singing is very close to the original. What makes these covers so essential is the nature of the material Harvey is working with. These are French songs originally, translated and set to English. After having heard so many of the original songs thousands of times, finding out what the songs are actually about makes these discs essential listening for a fan of Serge Gainsbourg. As albums go, these are really just songbooks meant to shower light on the writers, no different from the volumes of songbook LPs Ella Fitzgerald produced in the &#8217;50s. Yet as a listener you understand the words; you let the sounds of the words fall into the context of the music and let it all come together in your mind. To me, both LPs are a triumph of creative covering. By stripping away the primary language of the work you are left to marvel at the odd wit and wordsmanship of the originals. I would also say it is a fun way to work out what words in French are words in English. Essentially, these ARE faithful cover versions; the music is virtually identical. Perhaps the organ is a bit punchier but apart from that these are not great departures from the source material. There is even a female voice on the recordings &#8211; that of Australian singer Anita Lane. To me, this is where this gets interesting. See, Anita Lane was an early member of the Bad Seeds and was the girlfriend/wife of Nick Cave, who we all know and love from my description above. There is one other voice featured on both <em>Pink</em> <em>Elephants</em> and<em> Intoxicated Man</em> (stop me if you can see where this is going) and that voice belongs to one Mr. Nicholas Edward Cave. What song did Cave sing? None other than &#8220;Je’Taime Moi Non Plus,&#8221; (!) titled on this LP &#8220;I Love You…Nor Do I.&#8221; Cripes, if you thought the song sounded sleazy in the original French, this sucker just goes up a notch or four in the dirty scale. The line about kidneys is replaced but you can’t listen to the song the same way after listening to this version. “Physical love is a dead end” is just a knife in the ribs of romance. I know that the original versions of the song are real; at least the Jane Birkin version had the extra relationship angle on the music. In this version, the couple had been broken up/divorced for YEARS. Ooh just so sleazy. However, the duet between Cave and Lane was not her first take on recording the song, NO; she recorded the song with the bassist Barry Adamson on his 1993 EP <em>The</em> <em>Negro Inside Me</em>. Adamson, for those who don’t know, was the bassist in the legendary group Magazine before leaving to join in the formation of Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds with … Anita Lane, Nick Cave, and Mick Harvey. (Side Note – Adamson recorded the greatest version of John Barry&#8217;s (Jane Birkin’s first husband) 007 Theme on his 1992 release <em>Soul Murder</em>.)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbHuOgzKl5c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Mick Harvey left the Bad Seeds in 2009. He has continued to record and tour throughout this time and during his career. I think I place him in this grand part of the colonial English Diaspora. By that, I mean his Australian roots place him within this umbrella. When I see Harvey, and Nick Cave for that matter, they are the type that look out of place if not dapper or in suits. They always make me think of the Pogues in terms of dress &#8211; dress that lends them an air of middle class stability and position. But they’re Australian. I digress. Harvey released a disc of new music in May 2011, a collection of songs about death and loss. I have not had the opportunity to listen to that disc (I hope to soon), but I have heard Harvey’s contribution to another LP from 2011 on death and loss, albeit from the hands of politicians: PJ Harvey’s <em>Let England Shake</em>. As I <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/25/stuck/" target="_blank">wrote in March</a>, while recovering from walking pneumonia, I stumbled upon Mick Harvey&#8217;s work with PJ Harvey. In his &#8217;50s, his handsomeness has only been enhanced by age, the lines in the face accompanied by silver water in his hair. His was the first voice I heard that day and remains the voice I associate with the disc. His voice is such an earthy counterbalance to hers;  the interplay on &#8220;The Words That Maketh Murder&#8221; continue to bounce around my head during my quieter moments. Yet his contribution to this amazing work of art was not his first dance with Polly Harvey. He would have been working with the Bad Seeds at the time of the classic <em>Murder Ballads</em> LP that saw the PJ Harvey duet with Nick Cave, and he has played with Ms. Harvey when his first Gainsbourg songbook was released.</p>

<p>Myself, I’d love to hear an entire LP collaboration between the two Harveys, their voices intertwined like ivy climbing a fence. One can only hope that something else happens artistically between these two. Barring that, I just hope that Mick Harvey continues to make his music at his pace. I just hope I can understand it in real time the next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, I’m stuck on this song. Writing about Serge Gainsbourg for the past two weeks has me stuck on this, his famous-est song and filthiest song, &#8220;Je T’aime Moi Non Plus.&#8221; I’ve dedicated space to the song as sung by Gainsbourg with Bardot and with Birkin and I’ve spoken of Nick Cave’s version of the song. I just couldn’t let the song go and thought what better way to end weeks of writing about this titan of French music than with a big ol’ YouTube post filled with some cover versions of the song. Full disclosure, some of these versions are great. Some of them suck. Bad term. So of them aren’t very good. However I will leave you, my fearless readers, to figure out which versions belong and which don’t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So many things in today’s time feel like a novelty. Things that you can remember being special or unique are now standard. For the purpose of this piece, I&#8217;m thinking of music magazines coming with compact discs. The first magazine I remember with this added incentive was <em>CMJ</em>. <em>CMJ</em> stood for <em>College Music Journal</em> &#8212; sort of a <em>Billboard</em> magazine for college radio stations. There was a subsidiary magazine under their umbrella called <em>CMJ New Music Monthly</em>. Each month the magazine would feature a mix CD with 15-24 songs, some by artists you knew, some by artists you didn’t. These artists were featured in the magazine and on the CD. The discs were hit and miss. I still have one disc, June 1994. While there were a few good tracks on the CD, one stood out to my (then) young ears. It starts with these wild back-and-forth strings and a vocal tick bounces around the instruments. And then there is rapping. In French.</p>

<p>The rapper is a man named MC Solaar. The track is titled &#8220;Nouveau Western.&#8221; I always liked the song and I never expected to hear the main sample of the song again. But I did, four years later.</p>
<p>The record store I used to work at had an endcap, stocked by an employee, dedicated to what could be called outsider music. The endcap had a name, EGNARTS. (Think about it.) In 1998, a CD popped up on the endcap with a baby blue cover and a Lolita-esque figure clutching a teddy bear: <em>Historie De Melody Nelson</em> by Serge Gainsbourg. I can’t remember when I first heard it. All I can recall is that it floored me. I bought the disc. The price sticker was a white $24.99; it cost $17. I remember all those early CD prices. Red $14.99 ($10.30). Green $15.99 ($11.00). Pink $8.99 ($5.80). Yellow $11.99 ($7.00) and so on. I digress.</p>
<p>At the time I hadn’t heard anything like Gainsbourg’s music. I never gave much thought to the music of France. I enjoyed world music, definitely, but never from France. Probably the only thing I knew was the Solaar track. Yet there was something in this music, on this LP, that touched a nerve and led me into a buying binge of his music. What did it? What triggered this? <em>Je ne sais quoi</em>.</p>
<p>I must describe the LP. It is hushed, subdued in parts. One thing struck me immediately: the strings. Sweet jesus, these are the sleaziest strings in recorded history &#8212; the bass coming in slow; the strings, oh, those strings, tinkling along. I don’t know a lick of French (unlike Spanish &#8212; I can say &#8220;Hello,&#8221; &#8220;Your mother’s a whore,&#8221; and &#8220;The dog is big and black&#8221;), but the mood of the LP is set and carried by the sound of the music. There is one phrase of English on the LP: “Spirit of Ecstasy.” It is the name of Gainsbourg’s 1928 Rolls Royce and the real crosses with the fictional &#8212; the real car is on the record. It is in this car that the protagonist sees a teenage lass on a bicycle, feels lust in his heart and, in a true display of chivalry, knocks her off her bike with his car. The protagonist conspires to break a few laws with the femme, named Melody Nelson, before she ultimately dies in a plane crash. Let me make that look as ridiculous as it sounds: BEFORE SHE ULTIMATELY DIES IN A PLANE CRASH!!!! Wow. The true arc of the narrative is shocking, really when you think about it. And if you are like me, once you dig deeper into the artist’s career you realize, well, it isn’t outside of the normal range of shocking behavior from the artist.</p>
<p>A friend once said to me, &#8220;The thigh is nature’s napkin.&#8221; This quote sort of sums up Serge Gainsbourg’s career. Equal parts showman, musician, and provacateur, Gainsbourg’s biggest career hit was song &#8220;Je T&#8217;aime (Moi Non Plus),&#8221; which was banned in a few countries. Why was the song banned? Have a listen to the released version, recorded with Gainsbourg and his new muse, British actress Jane Birkin. Listen and guess why it was banned.</p>

<p>The sound is dirty, sure, but it is the moans that place this track onto a pantheon of truly filthy music. This was, however, the second version of the song Gainsbourg recorded. This dates to 1969 while his first version, recorded with John Lennon’s favorite bombshell Brigitte Bardot, in 1967. The Bardot version is dreamier, not quite as juicy as the Birkin version. Yet this version was shelved due to Bardot’s husband (as word goes) being jealous over the tone of the song and perhaps buying into the story that Bardot and Gainsbourg were actually having sex as they were recording the song, thus adding realism to the tone. Despite lyrics that translate to, “I come and go between your kidneys,&#8221; Gainsbourg considered the song an “anti-fuck” song. But by not understanding the French lyrics of the song, these deeper meanings were lost on the parts of the globe that didn’t understand the words and just found the sounds dirty.</p>

<p>The song is almost a novelty, a track that teeters on the edge of rendering its creator a one-hit wonder. And yet the song holds up and still, in some instances, is capable of shocking. It is also widely covered by artists as diverse as Donna Summer and Einztruende Neubauten to Cat Power, Cibo Matto, Malcolm McLaren, and the Pet Shop Boys. The song was covered by three-fifths of the original Bad Seeds as well (Barry Adamson, Nick Cave, and Mick Harvey).</p>
<p>To me, <em>Melody Nelson</em> is one of those LPs on which the sound of the voices singing merges with the sounds of the music to create a memorable experience. You don’t need to know what is being said to enjoy the music. Sly Dunbar, half of the famous reggae rhythm section Sly &amp; Robbie said of Gainsbourg during their late &#8217;70s collaboration, “We didn&#8217;t know what he was singing about, but his singing was good and the melodies were great.” That applies to all of Gainsbourg’s music, his various genre-skipping and his eventual descent into outrageous behavior almost for the sake of the behavior. The music is rich and deep, yet the LP itself is only 28 minutes long &#8212; miniscule. This allows for repeated listens without too huge of a time investment. And you don’t need to understand the words to understand the idea of what is happening in the story. The music sets the tones of the story; the singing underscores the music and adds the extra layer of emotion and tone to the LP. You FEEL the LP as you listen to it, all due to the individual pieces you hear.</p>
<p>Yet the disc is so enjoyable that you can fall into a trap of loading up on Gainsbourg’s music. This is a dangerous gamble because French music has something in common with reggae music: the more of it you listen to, the more it all sounds the same. Once music reaches that point, it is time to step back, which is what I finally did with Gainsbourg. Figuring that all his work would be so great, I loaded up on the Phillips reissues. This was a very uneven experiment. <em>Melody Nelson</em>’s followup contained odes to farting, poop, and monkeys. <em>Rock Around the Bunker</em> from 1975 leads off with a jaunty number called &#8220;Nazi Rock.&#8221; Gainsbourg hid from the Nazis in the &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s, yet he records this odd concept LP about the inner sounds being heard in a German bunker. Then he went to Jamaica with Sly &amp; Robbie and recorded with a proper reggae background. Normally such experimentation would be applauded, but eventually the music began to sound like a straight line. Around the same time there was a three-volume set issued on Mercury in 1997: <em>Coleure Café</em>, <em>Du Jazz Dans Le Ravin</em>, and <em>Comic Strip</em>. The first CD is his exploration of world music; the second his forays into jazz sounds; and the third is a collection of his pop sides. &#8220;Je T’aime&#8221; is on <em>Comic Strip</em>, as are his works with Bardot and Birkin. One of the songs on <em>Comic Strip</em> is &#8220;Bonnie and Clyde,&#8221; an homage to those famous outlaws. When I bought this disc and heard that second song I was transported back to listening to the <em>CMJ</em> CD and the MC Solaar song. Of COURSE that was the sample used by Solaar; rappers at the time were using what they were familiar with. Why wouldn’t a French rapper use a song about the Old West to rap about the Old West?</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKfBJMIANsM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I’m not going to lie, whenever I listen to &#8220;Bonnie &amp; Clyde,&#8221; I always laugh when Bardot comes in singing the word &#8220;Bonnie.&#8221; Her voice sounds so deep, so off. She comes back on throughout the rest of the song but that one bit always gets me.</p>
<p>Gainsbourg died in 1991, 20 years ago, at age 63. Hard living caught up with him as it will all of us. Thinking about him now, so long in the past, I started to wonder about where he would be today. Probably doing the same thing: living like a French Hugh Hefner, gallivanting around France with some young trophy on his arm. Would he be a joke like Hefner? Would the world of universal connectivity render his impact, his audacity and his shock limp? There could not be another Serge Gainsbourg in the world of 2011. Nothing is shocking to us anymore. We see death, decay, and disaster on the news and at the click of a mouse button. When was the last time the country was ever properly shocked? Not only that, but in America, we have moved from a decade of outward growth (the &#8217;90s) to one of recoiling inward (the &#8217;00s). Our civilization is spaced out and ingrown; the ability to shock from an authentic position has vanished. Another reason there would be no Serge Gainsbourg in 2011 is his appearance. We don’t allow the ugly to be famous. I’m not throwing stones at the dead; I think Gainsbourg thought of himself as an ugly fellow. I think that is what drove him into the arms of beautiful women. The ability to overcome his ugliness must have been intoxicating. Jane Birkin, his muse from 1969-1980, was also his object and cover girl. It was Birkin who provided the voice of Melody Nelson and the physical embodiment of the character. It was Birkin, seven months pregnant with the couple’s daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg, who served as the cover model for the LP. The sight of the cover allowed one to put a face to the giggles.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is simply enough that this artist was a titan in his country, a larger-than-life figure that cast a long shadow of the world he lived in. Perhaps it was the shock that drew his appeal; perhaps it was his appeal that caused the shock. Whatever it was, the music will live on for new listeners to discover.</p>
<p>One other notable thing Gainsbourg did in conjunction with the LP was &#8220;acting&#8221; in an accompanying short film of the LP. I think of it as the movie version of the record, but done in an awesome early &#8217;70s style. Back projection, psychedelic lights and images, and acting done to further the narration of the record. Had I seen this back when the LP was reissued, I would have loved it more and I would have understood it all better. Yet at the same time, I’m glad I didn’t see this until a few years ago. The images and understanding in my head are still with me to this day. If you are hearing this for the first time, sit back and watch the clips and marvel at the sound of the music, listen to the small bits on the track and let them all wash over you. Approach the rest of his catalog with caution but drive right into <em>Melody Nelson</em>, it rewards with every listen.</p>
