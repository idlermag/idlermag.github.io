										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never read <em>Harry Potter</em>. Working in a bookstore with loads of diehard Potter fans, my usual excuse often fell short. I tried telling people that I was simply too old when the books came out. The first book was published in the fall of 1998 in the U.S. and I was in eighth grade. My favorite author at the time was Stephen King. Why would I drop down a few reading levels when I didn’t even like wizards?</p>
<p>Not to mention, when I was growing up no one I knew was reading them. I don’t think I heard much about <em>Harry Potter</em> until the first movie came out in 2001, I was a junior in high school and reading Toni Morrison &#8212; for school &#8212; and Tom Clancy &#8212; for fun. But these reasons didn’t work on my coworkers. While most are my age or a few years younger, quite a few of them didn’t read the Harry Potter books until high school or college, so my age was no longer a factor. I had seen a few movies and I knew most of the spoilers &#8212; who dies, who marries who at the end, who isn’t as bad as you thought they were at the beginning &#8212; and I just wasn’t interested in reading these books since I knew the ending. This did not go over well.</p>
<p>So I made a compromise. I told my Potter-obsessed coworkers that if I ever had kids, which I didn’t plan on having, and if those kids wanted to read <em>Harry Potter</em>, I would read the books too. I still got a few, “Isn’t this new <em>HP</em> Lego set cool, oh wait you never read the books” comments, but for the most part the subject was laid to rest.</p>
<p>Well, here we are over a year later and I am indeed pregnant. I’m probably the only person who remembers this <em>Harry Potter</em> reading deal I made, but I’ve been thinking on it a lot. Mostly because I am a reader and I want my little boy to be a reader too. I already have a little library started, thanks to my mother and the children’s book manager at my store. I’ve tried reading aloud to my belly, but it feels really weird. Despite the fact that I regularly talk to myself aloud, reading a picture book to something that can’t see or really understand what I’m saying feels like something a crazy person would do.</p>
<p>I’m excited to read to my baby once he’s in the world and see him grow and learn to read for himself. I know <em>Harry Potter</em> is a good series, so I will be happy to have him read those books. The main reason I agreed to read them if I had a child was because if my kid is like most people he’ll love the books and want to talk about them. I would love to be a part of that conversation.</p>
<p>I also think it’s important to know what your kid is reading. Depending on how young he is when he starts I want to know what the series have in store as the books get longer and a little scarier. Since he won’t have to wait a year for the new book to come out, he won’t be growing up with Harry, my son could read them all in a row and I want to make sure the content is appropriate. I’ve had enough parents of 8 year-olds come in to buy <em>The Hunger Games</em> to understand that knowing the content of the books your child is reading is important.</p>
<p>“There’s not any sex in this book is there?”<br />
“Uh, no ma’am, just a lot of killing and some torture.”<br />
“Oh ok, we’ll take it.”</p>
<p>I know some people don’t want to read every book their teen or preteen is reading, but there are resources and book sellers who can tell you that <em>The Hunger Games</em> is coded for ages 13 and older for a reason. The world in that trilogy is scary and people die left and right. When your main character is told to kill or be killed you need more than 8 years of life under your belt to deal with it.</p>
<p>Right now though I just have to deal with Dr. Seuss and board books. The baby isn’t due until October and I can worry about whether he wants to read <em>Harry Potter</em> in a decade. I’m building my stack of kids books and learning to talk to the little guy who’s growing inside me, not just myself. Maybe I’ll even read to him soon. Though, to be honest, I would rather read the second Sandman Slim book, <em>Kill the Dead</em>, aloud to my belly than <em>The Lorax</em>. I’ll even skip the swear words.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wayne Barlowe is a living legend in the world of science fiction painting and creature art. Classically-trained at The Cooper Union, he became an award-winning author at age twenty-one with his first painted book, <em>Barlowe&#8217;s Guide to Extraterrestrials</em> (1979). Since then, his work has been seen in <em>Life</em>, <em>Time</em> and <em>Newsweek</em> magazines, on trading cards and on The Discovery Channel, in galleries and on hundreds of book covers. In the nineties, his science fiction and fantasy art books <em>Expedition</em> (1990), <em>The Alien Life of Wayne Barlowe</em> (1995) and <em>Barlowe’s Guide to Fantasy</em> (1996) secured his place as an artist’s artist and fan favorite. In the 2000s, he become synonymous with the arsenal of work he produced about Hell &#8212; from books of paintings and drawings to his critically-acclaimed debut novel, <em>God’s Demon</em> (Tor Books, 2007). He’s now one of Hollywood’s most sought-after creature designers and concept artists, contributing to such films as <em>Avatar</em> (2009), <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> (2004), <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> (2005), <em>The Hobbit</em> (2012) and most recently, Guillermo del Toro’s upcoming <em>Pacific Rim</em> (2013). Today, I have the honor of speaking with Wayne about his projects, his inspirations, his processes and the underworld that’s filled his work for a decade.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Your parents Sy and Dorothea Barlowe were well-known natural history artists, which I assume laid the groundwork for the refined knowledge you now have of anatomy. Did you spend much time drawing under your parents’ instruction as a child? Drawing animals from life? What were your childhood artistic years like?</em></p>
<p>My education was, primarily, by osmosis. Growing up with working, professional artists inculcated me with a sense of self-discipline and an appreciation for the degree of hard work that went into doing illustrations and putting books together. It was a slow process and the time-consuming, painstaking effort that went into doing scientifically accurate work was not lost on me. It imbued me with a personal desire to “get it right,” to measure twice and cut once, as the saying goes. And that philosophy layered itself atop my love of biology, anatomy and all things scientific. Okay, so I was an odd child. I drew constantly and my parents were both honest and encouraging. I rarely drew animals from life but we did have a ton of dried specimens and other natural objects which I did enjoy trying to render. But my interests in SF, Fantasy, WWI and ancient Rome skewed the drawings and I veered off from my parents’ work pretty early on. My school notebooks were filled with marginalia and studies of all kinds of things. The freedom was fun. I didn’t really get a handle on paint until I was in my mid teens. I had gone to an art and music camp for a few summers on Long Island and picked up acrylics there. They were a relatively new medium and I learned their attributes pretty quickly. I owe my continued use of them to those summers. My parents worked in gouache and I never really got the hang of it &#8212; the fact that you could re-activate the paint beneath annoyed me. But I was very happy with the fast drying speed of acrylics and the greater body. Once I got bitten by the paint bug, I was forever changed. I did a ton of work in my old, cluttered room. I painted a lot of aliens, and robots and Picts and you name it. Eventually, I managed to put a portfolio of paintings together (mostly imaginative stuff) and I was accepted into Cooper Union.   </p>
<p><em>Your first book</em> Barlowe&#8217;s Guide to Extraterrestrials <em>(1979) was published when you were only twenty-one, and remains an earmark of modern science fiction illustration still today. Since then, you’ve rendered and crafted countless creatures while rotating seamlessly between alien, prehistoric and horror imagery. Are there projects from your career that stand out as more challenging or more rewarding than others?</em> </p>

I had just left Cooper early and was more than ready to go out and conquer the world. I came up with the idea over a beer with my parents &#8212; it was the perfect merging of what they did with what I wanted to do in the world of science fiction. I probably could not come close to producing it as quickly as I did way back then. And, I’m not so keen on the quality of it these days. I was a kid and it was the perfect project for me back in 1979. <em>Expedition</em> was a real challenge. I had been painting covers for quite some time and had gotten into a rut. It was not a comfortable rut either. I realized, luckily, that I was losing touch with myself and simply jumping from one cover to the next without any thoughts other than those of pleasing sometimes arbitrary art directors. It was a dead end. So, I gambled with <em>Expedition</em>. I took the leap and did a painting and put together a proposal and sold it. And then had to spend three years working on it! It was a great, stimulating project and led to many other great projects, but it was pretty taxing. I was doing the artwork (30+ paintings and over a hundred drawings) and the writing (which, at that time, I was even more uncertain of than I am today) and the back/forth was daunting. On a positive note, I learned how the written word could catalyze images and vice versa. All in all, it was a struggle, complete with editorial battles, but very much worth it in the end.</p>
<p>Writing <em>God’s Demon</em> was, in a different way, even more challenging because while I had done some forty or so paintings in the Hell universe, I never considered myself a novelist. I still don’t. But here I was suddenly holding a contract in my hands and tasked with writing the epic story of Hell, of bringing together all of my paintings and eighteen years of thoughts into one comprehensive work. I don’t think a day went by when I didn’t ask myself what new, self-delusional form of hubris had been invented to enable me to think I could do this. It didn’t help that towards the end, when all of my creative juices were urging me on to finish the damned thing, I suddenly got called away to work on <em>AVATAR</em>. I had, insanely, thought I could write on weekends. It never happened. That book was probably the single hardest, creative endeavor to date.</p>
<p><em>I heard that you used sea life as an inspiration for some of the designs you worked on for</em> Avatar<em>. Can you share a little more about this and about your artistic involvement on the film as creature designer? Your art sensibility seems very well-suited to the production.</em></p>
<p>Thank you. Actually, only the sweeping lines and curves and detailing of cetaceans made their way into my early, personal design bible for <em>AVATAR</em>. A lot of that got dialed back, too. I was the first person called in on <em>AVATAR</em> and I remember how nervous and excited I was to be in the first wave, along with the three other talented designers under me, on such an ambitious project. It was such a deep, black-ops phase that not even the person who much later wrote the <em>Art Of</em> book was aware of us! Working with Jim was a blast &#8212; a true peak experience. After listening carefully to him I went down a path wherein I started to blend the aforementioned cetacean lines with Formula 1 car elements and added a dollop of amphibian skin for good measure. Big air scoops to accommodate and visually convey the denser air, large, flat skin surfaces for bold markings, pinched anatomical curves to suggest speed and power and plain alien-ness. I was doing some pretty strange things to animal forms and Jim liked it but, quite wisely, pulled me back. After all, it was his vision for Pandora and he had a very clear idea of where he wanted to go. I think, in hindsight, my earliest designs might have been too extreme and not relatable to a larger audience. That’s Jim’s genius &#8212; to know what will speak to people. <em>AVATAR</em> was a rich and amazing project and will remain, for me, a high-water mark in every way.</p>
<p><em>You also worked as a concept artist for the films</em> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban <em>and</em> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<em>. There have never been art books for any of the Harry Potter movies, correct? Are you able to tell us about your design contributions to</em> Harry Potter <em>3 and 4?</em></p>
<p>There is a book out now, but sadly, I am not mentioned. That happens. <em>Art Of</em> books come out so long after production that the lines of communication and awareness constrict until only the last few people are there to discuss the projects. It’s a shame because a lot of people deserve a lot of credit for their work but the last men standing simply aren’t aware of their contributions. Anyway, on <em>HP3</em> I designed the werewolf, made major contributions on the hippogriff, designed the monster books, the Hogwarts ghosts. On <em>HP4</em> I had a lesser role, but I did work extensively on the Death Eaters’ costumes, the dragons, the shark kid, Mad-eyed Moody’s artificial leg and a few other elements. </p>
<p><em>Your first novel</em> God’s Demon <em>(2007) was preceded by your art books about Hell (</em>Barlowe’s Inferno <em>[1998] and</em> Brushfire: Illuminations from the Inferno <em>[2001]), as well by as your 2000 screenplay, </em>Inferno: Rebellion in Hell<em>. The novel fleshes out ideas touched upon in all three of these works, which is part of what made it such a rich, ambitious and far-reaching narrative. Did it ever feel daunting to be working up a story based off a larger creative manifesto, rather than working within the confines of a more limited concept or stand-alone novel outline?</em></p>

On the one hand, I had the screenplay which served as a really good underpinning for the writing. And I had all of those annoying paintings and drawings which kept pushing their way into the process. They actually did a fine job of serving as visual touchstones for me. But once I started to get further into the writing, my spit-balled estimate of three pages of manuscript to one page of script started to go away. In other words, the book started to take on a life of its own and the script morphed into becoming a good skeleton to drape the narrative on. The script and the paintings were more of a resource to tap into than a burden. But I did feel the pressure of trying to get as much into the book as I could simply to mark out the territory and make it as real as I could.</p>
<p><em>One of most chilling attributes of the Hell depicted in your work is the sheer vastness of it, which imbues the place with an other-worldly hopelessness. The idea of a boundless landscape as a prison &#8212; where going anywhere leads you nowhere &#8212; reinforces notion that the suffering is inescapable because the space it is housed by is infinite. How did you come up with this idea which is a contrast to the typical, finite underworld or leveled Hell we’re accustomed to seeing?</em></p>

The world of Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> seemed too limiting to me &#8212; a series of rings that by definition are constraining. Clearly, that was appealing hundreds of years ago and something that the public could relate to. Later, Milton expanded upon it and made his Hell feel more like a dark region, a world that somehow existed but was vast. I ran with that ball. We live in an era where we are just beginning to understand the vastness of the universe and see it depicted in films. I could not have created a world for Hell that would have been any less expansive. I sometimes played with the idea of layering a temporal element to Hell &#8212; a kind of string-theory approach that would have involved multiple Hells that could co-exist but only be joined in certain locations. I had this crazy desire to show what humanity would evolve into and then place them in Hell next to our more familiar form. It was a rough concept but not one that found its way into the story. </p>
<p><em>You’re an avid reader with an extensive knowledge of traditional literature and classical science fiction.

Did you write much fiction in your spare time before you began your first screenplay in 1999?</em></p>
<p>I dabbled. I wrote a treatment for an old college project that people have asked me about for years &#8212; <em>Thype</em>. I still have to do something with that. I also tried a couple of short stories but they were small experiments. Nothing more. The screenplay came out of my love for the form. I think it’s particularly well-suited to me because of its obvious visual component. And I love narrative. So it’s a perfect blend. I suspect I will be writing more of them. </p>
<p><em>People have said that</em> God’s Demon <em>is in good company with classical works like Milton’s </em>Paradise Lost <em>and Dante’s </em>Inferno<em>. The characters in </em>God’s Demon<em> have an elevated capacity for humanity &#8212; though they are not technically human &#8212; which draws the reader to empathize and feel invested in their struggle. Sadness, regret, will, a yearning for redemption, a desensitization to the suffering of others and a wish to feel sympathy &#8212; these big themes are as pertinent to worldly suffering as they are to the idea of punishment in eternity. Was this an early part of the narrative, or did it come out organically as you crafted the story? How important was it to you to “humanize” Hell?</em> </p>

I tried hard to write something that would last and be engaging for a long time. That’s one of the reasons you find very few references to actual people in Hell, let alone any references to modern touchstones. And that’s also the reason I chose to “humanize” the demons. While I wanted them to be strange and, in some ways, distant, I did not want a reader to completely disassociate from their situation. It’s entertainment and by definition one needs to be able to relate to the struggles a character you are reading and enjoying is undergoing. All of the emotions you listed are, indeed, human but there is no reason to suggest that demons or angels would not feel them. Were I writing about true aliens I would probably have pushed further away from those emotions. But, if you buy the canon, the angels and demons were created by the same hand as we were. So, it makes sense that they would have the same kinds of emotions. And, that is pretty much how Milton, my spiritual muse on this project, envisioned them as well. His characters are the epitome of the emotions they display &#8212; nobility becomes Nobility, pride becomes Pride.</p>
<p><em>Well put. One of the visualizations that carried over from</em> Barlowe’s Inferno <em>to </em>God’s Demon <em>is the image of each of the condemned souls carrying their sins around in a heavy, black sphere, visible as a mobile and tumor-like orb in their form. Did utilizing these and other elements from your visual work make plotting the framework for</em> God’s Demon <em>easier, or was it a challenge to string together the components you wanted to retain for the novel?</em></p>
<p>The heavy-lifting of plotting was pretty much mapped-out and determined by the screenplay. For the novel, I added scenes as they seemed necessary, recognizing that I had more elbow-room and no real parameters with its length. And, by the time I began to write <em>God’s Demon</em>, I obviously knew I would not have the luxury of the artwork accompanying the text which was a mixed blessing &#8212; it forced me to be more descriptive but made the book a bit heavy on the visuals &#8212; something today’s readers are not always happy with. Luckily, more people than not enjoyed that degree of description. I very much wanted a reader who had seen my artwork to recognize scenes or elements from the paintings so it was important to make sure that I didn’t miss putting in anything key. That part &#8212; sprinkling in bits of from the art &#8212; was actually fun. For me, kind of like when you eat a bowl of Lucky Charms and you find a nice little marshmallow in with the cereal. But not all of the art is represented. Some of it was less narrative and just wasn’t appropriate to the greater story.</p>
<p><em>Creatively, how do your approaches differ between writing and visual art? Do painting and drawing come more easily to you since you’ve done them longer?</em> </p>
<p>Without a doubt, my artwork is much easier to generate. I’ve been doing it since I was a child whereas I have only been writing seriously for six or seven years. I truly labor over the writing and, when I’m really stuck, ponder how real writers do it. Probably with as little effort as I draw. If I say that I draw and paint more easily I’m not actually implying that I am satisfied with it. I can’t look at my artwork a week after I’ve done it. If my self-criticism is bad with art, it’s off the charts when it comes to my writing. As for my methods of writing, I made a lot of small notes on index cards for both the novel and the screenplays I’ve written. They are handy and I can tear them up with impunity if I don’t like the thought or even the way it’s written on the card. My notes are pretty neat and concise. Similar in tone with the thumbnail sketches I do in my notebooks. Though, I will say the thumbnails for my paintings are sometimes pretty sketchy. At this point in my career, I’m pretty practiced at taking a rough thumb and turning it into a painting. And, I also like the many small things that happen if you wing it with paint and are not slavish to a sketch. But, then, there’s the painting I finished that has four paintings beneath it&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Speaking of painting, I’m curious about your process and the types of materials you use. Depending on the needs of the project, do you prefer oils or acrylics? How large do you typically work when painting for yourself or for personal projects?</em></p>
<p>I only use acrylics. I used to use Lascaux acrylics from Switzerland but I have, in recent years, switched to Golden brand. Domestically produced, easier to find and almost the same quality. I prefer the paint to dry matte and the other brands don’t achieve that. I use Winsor &amp; Newton watercolor brushes for the finer detail and many different brands for the flats. I generally paint on Gessoboard because it’s not hard to get, is archival and relatively tough. I don’t work larger than 24&#8243; X 36” and have been gravitating to 16&#8243; X 20” lately. I will frequently put down a colored ground or go right to blocking in the background and then take pastels and block in the foreground elements. Nothing very unique about that. The acrylics are fairly forgiving and I can erase mistakes easily. As well as paint out big problems. Like entire paintings when I don’t like them!</p>
<p><em>Can you tell us what you have in the works right now? Any plans for a sequel to </em>God’s Demon<em> in the future?</em></p>

Safe to say, it is not set in Hell or any other universe I have created. I am also under contract to write a screenplay based on <em>God’s Demon</em> as well as a sequel to the novel. That book will be entitled <em>The Heart of Hell</em> and centers around Lilith and the Salamandrines. And, for those who’ve asked, many of the characters from the first book will be reappearing. I’ve gotten a bit into it and it’s giving me the opportunity to further expand Hell and the world-building that I so enjoy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent a number of years working in a bookstore in the early 00s, starting shortly after the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> in 2000. For a character who has appeared in books, films, toys, stickers, a theme park, and who knows what else, it&#8217;s always amusing for me to remember that at the time there was no merchandise at all. As the bookstore industry even then was moving to include more of what was called &#8220;sidelines&#8221; on the sales floor, this disposed us to look on the Harry Potter books fondly and J. K. Rowling as one of us: A book person. We relished the stories of Jo, a single mother, writing <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> in a coffee shop. We thought of all the money even then that she was turning down by not selling stuffed owls, or plastic broomsticks.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6289" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6289" data-attachment-id="6289" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/23/books-brooms-and-bad-video-games/hpvibratingbroom/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg" data-orig-size="348,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HPVibratingBroom" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=209" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=348" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=208&#038;h=300" alt="Broom" title="HPVibratingBroom" width="208" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6289" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=208&amp;h=300 208w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=104&amp;h=150 104w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6289" class="wp-caption-text">Remember why they took this off the market?</p></div> This, of course, all changed with the release of the film version of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> in 2001. I don&#8217;t remember all the details, because I tried not to pay attention, but I&#8217;m sure there were Harry Potter Happy Meals as well as the coloring books, posters, picture books, and other movie tie-ins that took over my bookstore. It was the end of a particular innocence that we as bookstore people should probably never have lulled ourselves into. Jo was still clearly a wonderful writer, but she wasn&#8217;t just a book person. She wasn&#8217;t one of <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>And you know what? None of that matters. The books, the films, the fan art and fiction, all of it is worth every cheap piece of plastic sold with a Harry Potter logo. Harry Potter is <em>better</em> as something more than a book.</p>
<p>I make this assertion with some confidence, having read all the books (I started late, but I caught up fast), seen all the films (except the last one &#8212; I&#8217;ll get there), and having spent more time buried in Harry Potter lexicons, fan-written stories, and Wikipedia entries than I care to admit.</p>
<p>Which brings me to a rather odd admission: There have been a host of Harry Potter video games &#8212; at least one for every film, and even a <em>Quidditch World Cup</em> game in 2003 &#8212; and <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> is the only one I&#8217;ve ever played. (You can read my final word on that game <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/">here</a>, in case you missed it.) As much as I love Harry Potter, I avoid Harry Potter video games like the plague because movie tie-in video games are almost universally terrible.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6290" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6290" data-attachment-id="6290" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/23/books-brooms-and-bad-video-games/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png" data-orig-size="256,364" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Harry_Potter_-_Quidditch_World_Cup_Coverart" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=211" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=256" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=210&#038;h=300" alt="HP Quidditch" title="Harry_Potter_-_Quidditch_World_Cup_Coverart" width="210" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6290" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=210&amp;h=300 210w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=105&amp;h=150 105w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6290" class="wp-caption-text">I actually almost bought this game.</p></div> In all honesty, this is a travesty. Adaptations should strengthen great characters and storylines. The plain fact of getting to encounter a character and story in a new form, not to mention all the little (or big) tweaks and changes necessary to make a story work in a different medium all <em>add</em> something to the greater whole. The book changes the way we see the film, and the film changes the way we read the book. Even running around on a cheap plastic broom changes the way we think about a Quidditch match, at least a little bit.</p>
<p>Video games should be a full-fledged part of this cross-media narrative exchange, and the only reason that they are not is that they are produced quickly and rushed to market, almost always constrained by the aesthetic and narrative determinations of the film they rehash. Even thinking of a game as an adaptation in its own right, rather than a marketing and merchandising tool, would be a huge step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Even better would be a game that tells a story of its own, in the universe suggested by but not limited to that created by a book or a film. There are plenty of good examples of this, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_Game" target="_blank">the 1998 <em>X-Files</em> PC game</a>, to the recent <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Shattered_Dimensions" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Edge_of_Time" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Edge of Time</a></em> games. (And, of course, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum" target="_blank">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>.) The best adaptations tell their own stories, and the Harry Potter theme park in Orlando proves every day that there are large numbers of people who would leap at the opportunity to live in Harry Potter&#8217;s world for a while (or longer than a while).</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to make a suggestion. Who knows? The internet is a big place. Maybe, just maybe, word will get back to Jo herself. We need a new Harry Potter video game. Not one that revisits all the films in one 100+ hour multi-disc game. Not even a Harry Potter MMORPG. (Which would probably sell like gangbusters, and might even be cool, but it&#8217;s a little too obvious a place to start.) No, what I want is a game based solely on the Battle of Hogwarts and the preceding year at the school, maybe from Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley&#8217;s point of view. I want the story that we didn&#8217;t get in the book <em>or</em> the film. I want to get to flesh out two great characters who do really important things even though we don&#8217;t see that much of them while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out camping. I want to direct the defense of the school. I want to cut off Nagini&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>You could probably even sell some controllers shaped like Godric Gryffindor&#8217;s sword. It would be worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="It all ends" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allwelike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/harry-potter-4.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="427" />I haven’t read a word of the Harry Potter series. Not one word. My intentions to do so were fleeting and only arose once the people around me, the ones whose opinions I trust implicitly, began reading and recommending it to me. It all sounded good, but I was already three films deep at the time and those books are not short. In fact, nearly all of the films based on them clock in at well over two hours and I have yet to see one without someone complaining about something being left out.</p>
<p>So that ship had sailed. In all honesty, I almost didn’t get on board with the films either. Chris Columbus, director of <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em> (1987), <em>Home Alone</em> (1990) and <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em> (1993), is certainly competent, but he doesn’t exactly bring much to the table, and I was mostly underwhelmed by his interpretation of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em> (2001). It is a fine children’s film, but carries only a hint of what’s to come. He tackled the sequel, <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> (2002), with equal (lack of) flair and style. I was fond of Harry, but in the same way I’m fond of most of my extended family. “That was nice visit. See you in a few months.”</p>
<p>Then came Alfonso Cuaron, director of the fabulous Spanish film, <em>Y Tu Mama Tambien</em> (2001) and the third Harry Potter film, <em>The Prisoner of Azkaban </em>(2004). It was the first Potter flick I made a point of seeing in the theater. Call me a snob, but Cuaron’s name being mentioned lent a certain air of respect to what I had viewed as being largely children’s fare (albeit, better-than-average children’s fare). More mature, stylish and foreboding, <em>Azkaban</em> quickly became my favorite Potter film, establishing a vibe the series maintained throughout the rest of its impressive run.</p>
<p>Ever since <em>Azkaban</em> I have managed to see all but <em>Goblet of Fire (2005) </em>in theaters. The series has certainly become aesthetically brilliant, but the stories have matured as well. In fact, what’s most impressive to me about the Harry Potter series in general, aside from the engrossing story, aside from the large cast of unique, complicated characters, is the fact that J.K. Rowling has managed to craft a tale that has matured right along with its fan base. There are many Potterheads (is that a thing? If it isn’t, it should be) that started reading the series when they were young and, now in early adulthood, feel as though they have grown up with Harry and friends because, well, they have.</p>
<p>There is no better evidence of this than when Harry, gazing into the pensieve for the last time using Snape’s tear (I hear tell its brain matter or something in the book. I’m kind of okay with that change), sees visions of himself in the previous films. Even being what I would describe as a casual fan, it’s really something to take in what a journey these films (and books) have been for so many involved.</p>
<p>No, I have no plans to read the books now. I know how it ends. I have taken the trip, even with the inevitable shortcuts a film adaptation must take. I’m okay with that. I am not sad to see the series come to a close because all good things must come to an end, and Harry Potter and friends have a fine ending, indeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gentlemen, witches and wizards, boys and girls, this, is a love fest. This is the story of a girl falling for a book. Never before has the world known such unabashed devotion. If <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> had a window I would have stood beneath it in the pouring rain tossing pebbles at the beveled glass. I would have held up a boombox blasting The Weird Sisters until my arms fell off.</p>
<p>But Harry didn’t have a window in his cupboard beneath the stairs, so instead I stood outside of bookstores counting down to midnight. I spent entire nights and the pre-dawn hours voraciously consuming 700+ pages of magic, defeat, and triumph. A decade later I waited outside amongst cloaked Quidditch enthusiasts of all ages, shivering in the November flurries, awaiting the midnight screening of <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1</em>. Despite my gut reaction, the division of the final movie into to parts was not cruel, but an act of mercy. A way to buy my childhood a little more time.</p>
<p>I was 13 when I read the first book. Marooned at a cottage with my family, I quickly blew through my arsenal of Christopher Pike’s <em>The Last Vampire</em> series, when I was forced to convince my sister (a year younger than me) to lend me her copy of <em>Harry Potter</em>. “Keep it,” she said, “I hate reading.” You guys,  I am resisting the urge to write a painfully lame line about keeping it forever in my <em>heart</em>. But, I totally kept that book. Twelve years later it’s on my shelf in Boston. <em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em> has moved with me more than 10 times.  </p>
<p>I read the entire novel in a single afternoon while eating Mackinac fudge like a true Michigander.</p>
<p>When I was 12 my mom gave birth to my sister Allie. I bided my time as she learned to  crawl, and then speak, and finally read, dying to introduce her to the truth, the light, etc. that was The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. She took her sweet time, dragging her feet along the ABC’s. Spending nearly a year with the good Dr. Seuss and finding the wild things.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6270" style="width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6270" data-attachment-id="6270" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/21/magic-is-real-if-you-want-it/rowling_1231/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg" data-orig-size="295,340" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="rowling_1231" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=260" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=295" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=260&#038;h=300" alt="J. K. Rowling" title="rowling_1231" width="260" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6270" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=260&amp;h=300 260w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=130&amp;h=150 130w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6270" class="wp-caption-text">Thanks, Jo.</p></div> And then finally the day came.  She was eight. It was more or less the first day she could hold a novel that I shoved <em>The Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> into her chocolate-frog sized hands.</p>
<p>I was desperate for another reader in the family. Four years later I am happy to report that my plan worked flawlessly. Allie has read every Harry Potter book at least five times. When she’s home sick from school we text each other Harry Potter trivia questions. Or rather, we did do this until she informed me she had an HP trivia book that I should really consider borrowing.</p>
<p>She knows everything there is to know about magical beasts. She’s been reading at a college reading level since sixth grade. She’s the coolest person I know. All of these things are connected.</p>
<p>Recently, while watching one of the early films Allie responded to my mother’s thoughtful question about spell logistics with, “Perhaps you should read the books.” Just totally shut her down. No one should mess with a girl when she’s watching her stories.</p>
<p>I know Harry and J.K. Rowling hard a hard go of it at first, what with the poverty, and manuscript rejections(!), and law suits from Christian associations that feared the magic in the books promoted witchcraft among children. About as valid as the fear that Twilight is leading youngsters down the glamorous road to necrophilia.</p>
<p>Even if you hate <em>Harry Potter</em> because you think it’s too mainstream, or rips off English lore, or is just plain beneath you, you should respect it. This Englishwoman, this single mother, created a universe that made millions of people, adults and children alike excited about reading. She changed my life forever. She made me a better person. She gave me hope, and showed me good wins out. And that’s the most magical thing I can imagine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, in a corner suite on the fourth floor of the very lovely Hotel Rouge in Washington, D.C.&#8217;s tony Dupont Circle neighborhood, I lay on a king sized bed, finished my quinoa/ dried berry / green leaf lettuce / dinner salad, and read the last ten pages of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em>.</p>
<p>For the first time.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Mind you, it&#8217;s no accident I made it this long without reading them. My roommate in college discovered the novel the summer after our freshman year &#8212; that would have been June, 1999. She adored it, and began reading each as it debuted, even organizing midnight Harry Potter parties at the independent bookseller in our hometown.</p>
<p>But I, ever the hater of all things beloved by everyone else, turned my nose up. Not only did my snobbish disdain for something I&#8217;d not read a word of give me the ability to do something unusual &#8212; that is, feel superior to my fellow English majors &#8212; it fit into my aesthetics formed &#8212; where else &#8212; in baseball.</p>
<p>To my mind, Harry Potter was like the Yankees: given every possible advantage for success without working hard enough to make the real fan, the burgeoning 18th c. literature aficionado, feel they&#8217;d earned it. British author? Check. Charming, if easy, narrative? Check check. Accessible for all? Checkity check check check.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. Harry isn&#8217;t a Yankee, though he is born under the burden of heavy expectation. He&#8217;s not Derek Jeter, a seemingly charmed (if likeable) hero. He&#8217;s certainly not Jason Giambi, or Alex Rodriguez &#8212; players who couldn&#8217;t seem to live up to their hype until they were lampreyed onto some greater player&#8217;s underbelly.</p>
<p>No, Harry was Johnny Damon. Johnny of an unknowable level of talent in his early years in Kansas City, Johnny with his lightning strike speed and freakish outfield instinct in Oakland. Johnny in Boston, not fully realizing until the 2004 ALCS, perhaps, just how great a foe he and his teammates were up against, Johnny and his ragtag gang of self-named misfits, the idiots, lacking pedigree and pinstripe. </p>
<p>The Yankees were Voldemort. (How else to explain A-Rod&#8217;s spectacularly nefarious swatting of the ball from the first baseman&#8217;s glove?) An evil, long-simmering force that took over seemingly decent people and turned them into entitled, unappreciative fan-monsters. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in any hurry to read the rest &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a stack of library books higher than Johnny&#8217;s current Mohawk taking precedence &#8212; but I&#8217;m finally learning the lesson about the book and the cover and judgment. Or, at least, the lesson about making sure you assign the correct judgment to said book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I’m in the process of moving across the country, cooking has been the farthest thing from my mind. I eat odd things at odd hours of the day and spend the rest of the time searching for things I’ve lost in one box or another, lamenting my less-than-stellar eating habits to anyone who will listen, and sleeping. Before I left, my aunts gave me a going-away present: <em><a href="http://bit.ly/qWO2Hf">The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook: From Cauldron Cakes to Knickerbocker Glory&#8211;More Than 150 Magical Recipes for Wizards and Non-Wizards Alike</a> </em>by Dinah Bucholz. Because I’d planned my move around the midnight showing of the last Harry Potter movie, it was the perfect time to get out my wand (or, as my father so adorably called it, my “wizard stick”) and drown my sadness in some Harry Potter treats.</p>
<p>I spent my non-driving hours during the car ride from Boston to Michigan perusing the book and planning a Harry Potter lunch of epic proportions before the midnight showing. As the day got closer, I started to get unreasonably anxious. I often get anxious before large-scale events that have nothing to do with me (Spartan football games, Broadway musicals, and apparently midnight showings). It’s probably some sort of misplaced excitement, but as stupid as it sounds, the end of the Harry Potter franchise was a big moment for me. I’m only repeating what’s been said by anyone my age who started reading the series when they were the same age as the characters. (I was 12, and still young enough to believe that Hogwarts just might be real and my letter had just gotten lost. Yes, it probably wasn’t real. But maybe it <em>could</em> be.) As someone who reads every day, I still believe that I’ll never enjoy reading a book as much as I enjoyed reading the last Harry Potter book.</p>

<p>It may be that my quitting my job and moving from one coast to another coincided with what I’ll go ahead and call The Unofficial End of my Childhood, but I started to get more and more anxious about my big planned lunch. After weighing my options, I decided to downgrade to a snack, so that my epic lunch didn’t make me rushed and late for the movie. I chose to make some Pumpkin Pasties and pretend it was September 1 on the Hogwarts Express, partly because my dad already had most of the ingredients but mostly because the train has all sorts of adorable significance.</p>
<p>When I got to the grocery store, I had a sudden flash of panic. Why had I chosen <em>pumpkin</em>, of all things? It’s not like it’s an ingredient that’s filling the shelves in July. When I asked a worker, she took me over to the aisle and pointed at the small yellow sign: <em>Due to a small crop, canned pumpkin will not be available until the fall. </em>I tried not to have a full-scale meltdown. Apparently I’d attached much more significance to making this dessert than I’d realized.</p>
<p>“What are you making?” the woman asked. Even though I was wearing my Gryffindor scarf, I had moment of shyness and, instead of telling her the truth, I said simply, “A pastry.” “Well,” she said, “can’t you replace it with something? Maybe apple?” I tried very delicately not to lose my shit while I explained to her that it HAS TO BE PUMPKIN AND WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE. She made sure to tell me several times that all the stores in the area were out, and maybe I could just make something else. I said, “No, I really can’t.”</p>
<p>Instead of believing that twit, I went to Meijer. Lo and behold, they had plenty of cans of pumpkin. My adrenaline was pumping and I had a moment of instability where I wanted to go back to Kroger and shove the can of pumpkin in that woman’s face, or perhaps turn her into a bouncing ferret. But I figured my time would be better spent making pastries.</p>
<p>I mixed the butter, shortening, and flour together in the blender, since I had no food processor. The mixture was nothing like the light, fluffy texture it was supposed to be, but I thought I smelled the blender’s metal parts smoking, so I decided to just mix it together by hand and hope for the best. When I was done, the dough didn’t seem as doughy as it should have been, but the recipe specifically said it was better to be too wet than too dry. I wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Next, for the filling, I stirred the godforsaken pumpkin together with cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg. At this point, I realized that I didn’t really have any idea what pasties were (and I knew I wouldn’t be using them in a burlesque show.) Thankfully, my friend Anna came over to partake and had done her research. The pasties should end up looking something like pierogi, filled with the pumpkin, folded over, and pinched on their sides.</p>
<p>I got the dough from the fridge and shaped it into small circles with my hands, since it was too sticky for a rolling pin. I dredged up some old knowledge from making homemade pierogi and started folding. I got too overzealous with the pumpkin filling and had to spoon some out of each pasty before it could close. I poked holes in the top of each to aerate them, and stuck them in the oven.</p>

<p>Anna and I passed the time watching Harry Potter-related videos (I recommend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbH0nbilYek">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a9Z050teRY">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a9Z050teRY">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXuOj9d5o8">this one</a>). I decided to check on the pasties two minutes before their 30 were up, and was glad I did, because the thin edges were burnt. The inside, however, was perfect. The pastry was flaky but not dry, and the pumpkin was hot but didn’t burn. They were sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. They weren’t the prettiest, but they went well with my Gryffindor scarf and were a perfect appetizer to tear-soaked popcorn while I realized that I might be a Muggle after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>That is, I&#8217;m not quite done, but I&#8217;m <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>I own several of the Traveler&#8217;s Tales LEGO video games. I&#8217;ve played the first two <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games on my GameCube. I unlocked all of the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Jedi on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. I played <em>LEGO Batman</em> on my Playstation 2. I unlocked all the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Hero or True Villain on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. And now that I&#8217;ve played <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> on my Playstation 3, I think I can safely ignore <em>LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars</em>, and <em>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean</em>. </p>
<p>In fact, I don&#8217;t think I need to play a LEGO video game ever again.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6144" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6144" data-attachment-id="6144" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/168244-5-screenshot/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg" data-orig-size="608,456" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="168244-5-screenshot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=608" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Lockhart" title="168244-5-screenshot" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-6144" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=600&amp;h=450 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6144" class="wp-caption-text">Gilderoy Lockhart. Annoying in the book. Annoying in the game.</p></div> According to <em>LEGO Harry Potter</em>&#8216;s completion stats, I&#8217;m 98.7% done. I&#8217;ve earned True Wizard on every level, collected all 20 of red bonus bricks, all 24 of the house crest pieces, unlocked 166 of the 167 characters, rescued 49 of the 50 students in peril, and collected 198 of the 200 gold bricks. Even for all this, I&#8217;m closer to done than it sounds. And further away. You earn a gold block for rescuing students, so I actually have just one student and one more gold brick to find. Finding all 200 gold bricks unlocks a bonus level, where I&#8217;d find the final character, Lord Voldemort. So I have just three tasks left to complete. Except that I can&#8217;t find that last student in peril, or that last gold brick. I&#8217;ve even consulted the cheat guides, but there are just too many students in peril, and too many gold bricks. I&#8217;m not sure which one of each is the one I&#8217;m missing, so I don&#8217;t know what to go looking for. I&#8217;ve tried to systematically make my way through Hogwarts, but clearly I&#8217;m missing something. And there&#8217;s a substantial amount of time involved in walking again through Hogwarts, with its many twists and turns, in anything resembling a thorough fashion.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not fun.</p>
<p>In another game, that might be less of a criticism. In another game, the rewards would be set up differently. I might need to spend more time grinding to bring my characters up to a level where they&#8217;re strong enough to explore a new area without getting killed, but the payoff would be new weapons and armor, new side quests and new storylines. I might have to keep practicing until I could jump and grab and balance just right, but the reward would be access to a new level with new challenges.</p>
<p>In the LEGO games, the only reward is the sense of completion. Lord Voldemort may be the final character, but within the LEGO games, all the members of a particular character class are pretty much identical, except for the aesthetics. There&#8217;s nothing that Lord Voldemort can do that any other dark wizard can&#8217;t do, except to earn me a couple of trophies. (Which again, give you nothing but bragging rights and a sense of completion.)</p>

Or those white pants?</p></div>
<p>Even worse, when you do finally complete the game, there&#8217;s literally nothing else to do. Once you have 100% and all the trophies, there&#8217;s no reason to come back and keep playing. You really may as well just sell the game.</p>
<p>And at least for me, there&#8217;s something wrong with that. I <em>want</em> to have a reason to keep my old games on the shelf. It appeals to the collector in me. But as obsessive as I am, I still can&#8217;t justify holding on to a game where there&#8217;s actually less reason to play through a level once you&#8217;ve done it the first time. It&#8217;s still fun to ride around the Old West as John (or Jack) Marston. It&#8217;s still fun to solve the puzzles in <em>Portal</em> and <em>Portal 2</em>, and to stumble on a line of dialogue from GLaDOS or Wheatley that you missed the first time through. Once you&#8217;ve found all the hidden items in the LEGO games, however, they&#8217;re gone, so while most of the levels are designed to require at least two playthroughs to find all the bonus items, there&#8217;s no incentive to keep coming back. There&#8217;s actually less to each level than there was the first time through.</p>
<p>It may be part of the problem that I&#8217;m a <em>Harry Potter</em> fan, and the somewhat humorously mimed version of the storyline in the games actually impedes enjoyment of the game. It may be that the <em>Star Wars</em> movies were ripe for some light parody, and there are enough campy takes on the <em>Batman</em> rogues&#8217; gallery that the silly, over-the-top feel of the LEGO version seemed like a good fit. But the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe, as it develops, becomes much, much darker. Without that sense of genuine menace, there&#8217;s little reason to watch as several hundred pages of character and plot are crammed into a few minutes of animated charades.</p>
<p>More than anything else, my gameplay has become pathological. I&#8217;m searching and searching for those last few items just because I&#8217;m so close to that magical but totally arbitrary 100%. I&#8217;m frustrated, and I&#8217;m just wasting time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not having any fun.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t need to do that.</p>
<p>Unless they make another <em>Batman</em> game. . .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>[What exactly is a counterfictional? You can find the answer (and more examples) <a href="http://counterfictionals.blogspot.com/2008/07/why-counterfictionals.html" target="_blank">here</a>.]</em></p>
<p>J. K. Rowling&#8217;s <em>Harry Potter</em> series is a masterwork of young adult fiction, one that is at least as rich and will be just as enduring as C. S. Lewis&#8217;s <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em>. (Also, it made better movies. Just sayin&#8217;.) It has a devoted fan base, rich characters, an intricately-planned seven-volume plot, a stirring ending, and, um, I&#8217;ll just say it, a disappointing epilogue. Before you leap down my throat, please at least grant me that Rowling herself seems to have implicitly acknowledged that the epilogue leaves something to be desired. Otherwise, why in the world would she have spent so much time in interviews talking about what each of the characters did after the end of the seventh book?</p>
<p>In fact, these interviews have resulted in a rather odd pseudo-canon. You heard that Dumbledore was gay, right? Well, that&#8217;s never actually explicitly stated in the book. You knew that Ginny Weasley becomes a professional quidditch player, Hermione works in the Ministry of Magic, and that Harry and Ron became aurors, right? Not in any of the books they don&#8217;t. The one real piece of information that you get (other than who got married and the names of their kids) is that Neville Longbottom becomes Herbology professor at Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Which brings me, finally, to my point. J. K. Rowling, as brilliant as she is, totally screwed up. Or I should say, she&#8217;s wrong. Harry Potter does not become an auror. The books never say so, and if you read closely, you can figure out what it is that Harry really does after his final battle with Lord Voldemort.</p>
<p>Harry becomes Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) professor at Hogwarts, the youngest professor in Hogwarts history, and the first person to hold the job for more than a single year since Dumbledore denied it to Tom Riddle.</p>
<p>How do I know this? let me list the ways:</p>
<p><strong>1. Harry has at least as much experience as any other possible candidate for the job.</strong></p>
<p>In Rowling&#8217;s novels, holding the Defense Against the Dark Arts job is often detrimental to one&#8217;s health. By the end of <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, out of the six people who have held the DADA professorship (I&#8217;m going to ignore the Death Eater who holds the job under Snape in book 7), three are dead, one is locked up in Azkaban, one has no memory, and one wasn&#8217;t even actually the person who had been hired but stole the job by locking up that person in a box and quite literally stealing his identity. (The person who was supposed to have had the job but was locked up in a box? He&#8217;s dead too, just in case you&#8217;re keeping track.) After the Battle of Hogwarts, there&#8217;s no one around who has taught Defense Against the Dark Arts who could possibly pick up the job.</p>
<p>Except Harry. Who taught a wildly successful Defense of the Dark Arts class in secret during his fifth year at Hogwarts. Harry&#8217;s students, who called themselves &#8220;Dumbledore&#8217;s Army,&#8221; consistently praised his instruction, and played a key role in Valdemort&#8217;s defeat in the Battle of Hogwarts. Furthermore, the new Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall, has long been a patron of Harry&#8217;s and keenly aware of his extraordinary talent.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget that Harry defeated Lord Voldemort in single combat. More than once. That has to count for something.</p>
<p><strong>2. Harry is who Tom Riddle should have been.</strong></p>
<p>Rowling spends as much time on the similarities and connections between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle as on their differences. They&#8217;re both orphans with incredible amounts of raw magical talent. They both share a deep need to prove themselves. They both suffered dearly in the muggle world. They both have extraordinary abilities, unusual even within the wizard world.</p>
<p>While <em>Deathly Hallows</em> establishes that Voldemort/Riddle uses the Defense Against the Dark Arts position as an opportunity to visit Hogwarts both to hide a horcrux (Ravenclaw&#8217;s diadem) and to find an artifact to use as a new horcrux, Dubledore also believes (as do I) that Riddle really wanted the job. Sure, Voldemort is enough of a bastard to curse a job that he never really even wanted, just to spite Dumbledore, but, at the same time, Voldemort is not a very subtle person, and Dumbledore is never totally sure what really happened. If Voldemort had placed a curse out of spite, he wouldn&#8217;t have made any secret of it. How much more damage would it have done Dumbledore if the world knew that Voldemort had placed a jinx right under his nose, and there was nothing Dumbledore could do about it? No, the subtle, secret hex is the action of a man who doesn&#8217;t want to admit that he&#8217;s been touched in a vulnerable place.</p>
<p>Voldemore wanted the job so badly that when he was turned down he made sure that no one else could have it either. Until Harry breaks the curse and takes the job for himself.</p>
<p><strong>3. Harry cannot become an auror because Harry needs to die a peaceful death.</strong></p>
<p>A major point in the resolution of <em>Deathly Hallows</em> is that the power of the Elder Wand will be broken if it is never taken from Harry and he dies a natural death. If Harry has any desire for this to happen, he would never, never become an auror, the job most likely to lead him to a violent death and the transferral of the Elder Wand&#8217;s power to a new owner.</p>
<p>Harry, instead would lead a quiet, retired life. Maybe as a teacher, in the most secure magical fortress in England, especially if there were a job with enough excitement to make the day-to-day a touch more interesting. Within a year, Harry would be holding &#8220;Dumbledore&#8217;s Army&#8221; extra-credit sessions in the room of requirement, open to all, but especially popular with Gryffindors.</p>
<p>After all, it&#8217;s worth remembering that Hogwarts is where Harry (and Tom Riddle) were really happy. I can imagine no better end than for Harry to live out his years celebrating Christmas in the great hall with staff and friends, cheering at Quidditch matches, and offering the occasional tip to the new Gryffindor seeker. Maybe one day there&#8217;d be a new student or two whose adventures were worth a book of their own.</p>
