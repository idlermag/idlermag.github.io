										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spate of coaching changes rocked the NHL during the regular season. The litany of leadership switches landed ESPN’s front page on the regular and at the time I remember thinking: “Is this really going to help?”</p>
<p>There are a zillion good reasons to fire a coach, but seven firing/hiring stunts in about two months raised eyebrows. Was it groupthink, coincidence, or just a lot of pot-stirring?</p>
<p>In reality and fairness, each of the coaches should get a full season in behind the bench before being evaluated. But if we’re going to peek early, now that we’re more than half way through the Stanley Cup Playoffs (although in my world they are already over) it’s an interesting time to tentatively take stock.</p>
<p>Of the eight teams that swapped coaches, five &#8212; the Hurricanes, the Canadiens, the Ducks, the Maple Leafs, and the Blue Jackets &#8212; didn’t make it to the playoffs.</p>
<p>Of those that did see the postseason &#8212; the Capitals, the Blues, and the Kings &#8212; only L.A. is still in contention with the third round underway.</p>
<p>Even if the L.A. Kings win the Stanley Cup, the results make it pretty tough to draw many conclusions about coaching changes and postseason success this year.</p>
<p>What the coaching switch has done so far is made for some soap opera-style drama &#8212; two teams are currently coach-less &#8212; so we can talk a little bit about the old default strategy of stirring the pot.</p>
<p>The Montreal Canadiens were terrible this year, but Randy Cunneyworth, who was brought in to replace Jacques Martin, stirred Hab nation to a boil. Cunneyworth is already back out the door &#8212; not because the Canadiens were bad, although they were, but because he can&#8217;t speak French. With a losing record on the books, the Canadiens still have no idea who’ll be in charge next.</p>
<p>Right now, though, the Capitals are providing even more coaching suspense.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/washington-capitals-after-missing-another-opportunity-have-issues-to-settle/2012/05/14/gIQAdfrcPU_story.html">the <em>Washington Post</em> reported</a> in its postseason recap, the Caps dropped a high-caliber coach in Bruce Boudreau to take a chance on Dale Hunter, who wasn’t even sure he wanted to coach in the NHL.</p>
<p>The Caps had a respectable and downright exciting postseason run (though they barely made it in), but Hunter already resigned his position, even after being lauded for instilling discipline and “accountability” in the streaky team.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/washington-capitals-after-missing-another-opportunity-have-issues-to-settle/2012/05/14/gIQAdfrcPU_story.html">the <em>Post</em> article</a>, it sounds like the coaching hire has been mired in controversy from the start.</p>
<blockquote><p>“&#8230;the notion that Hunter had implemented sort of magic elixir of a system is a myth. Boudreau was in the process of changing the Capitals’ approach when he was fired for essentially one reason: <a href="http://stats.washingtonpost.com/nhl/playerstats.asp?id=3637&amp;team=23">Alex Ovechkin</a> didn’t want to play for him anymore because &#8212; ironically &#8212; Boudreau began insisting on accountability from everyone, including his superstar. Hunter was a different voice saying many of the same things &#8212; to the team in general and to Ovechkin in specific.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As if Ovechkin weren&#8217;t enough to handle, following the season there were rumors that Alexander Semin, the Capitals other leading forward, didn’t want to remain with the team because, as <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/7929902/agent-says-washington-capitals-alexander-semin-headed-free-agency">his agent told ESPN</a>,  the team &#8220;decided to change directions.” Now <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/alex-semin-denies-done-capitals-ovechkin-talks-ice-143626606.html">he’s denying those rumors</a>. Still, it’s likely his decision could be influenced the by the coaching pick.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the style and performance of two teams is in utter limbo. If the GMs were hoping to stir the pot (and not just follow the herd), they succeeded. Though not in the way I imagine they planned.</p>
<p>It’s easy to wonder if the Caps and the Canadiens might have been altogether better off keeping the coaches they started the season with. After all, Boudreau was just signed to a two-year contract with the Anaheim Ducks, so couldn&#8217;t Ovechkin have gotten over himself? And I&#8217;ve seen Martin on some lists as a potential Hunter replacement for the Caps, just to make things weirder.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s obviously no way to know.</p>
<p>Inevitably, more coaching switches will go down between now and next postseason, but these two organizations will be the teams to watch. Their ability to weather a revolving door of coaches &#8212; and possibly players &#8212; may help other general managers with their hiring and firing decisions, whether they know it or not. Or at least, a GM might think twice before firing a coach to try and stir the pot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Why are the Red Wings so good?”</p>
<p>I’m going to see the Flyers play the Red Wings in Philly next week and this question is poking at me. It’s been just a couple weeks since the Wings unseated the 1975-76 Philadelphia Flyers for longest home win streak, so the game feels like it has some sort of fateful historical gravity. But if you’re only looking at this year’s team, you’d be missing the larger, more interesting mystery.</p>
<p>I’ve been living in fear every time the Flyers play the Red Wings pretty much since I started watching the Flyers at age ten.</p>
<p>After the Devils but before the Rangers, my dad taught me to hate the Red Wings. They swept the Flyers in the 1997 Stanley Cup finals and for that we can never forgive them.</p>
<p>That was about 15 years ago.</p>
<p>So now, at least for me, the mystery is so profound it’s taken on something of a philosophical quality.</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot would surely be offended that the first place I go to gain some insight on an intractable mystery like this one is Google (though maybe I could just ask Gavin), but really that would just be jealousy.</p>
<p>Even if it didn’t really answer this deep-seated question for me, what comes up on a Google search is actually pretty fascinating in its own way.</p>
<p>Here are some explanations I’ve culled from the “depths” of the interwebs:</p>
<p><strong>Ken Holland:</strong> Turns out Ken Holland has been GM about as long as I’ve been watching hockey, too. Under him the Wings have won more games than any other NHL team, not to mention four Stanley Cups. He helped the Red Wings survive the salary cap. More than that he built a team that thrived while other clubs faltered. Sports Illustrated named him the GM of the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>So what is <em>it</em> about Holland? Is it his experience as a scout for the Wings, his experience as goaltender? What does he have that no other GM has? And why does that allow him to make his team great?</p>
<p>In 2008, <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1154241/index.htm">E.M. Swift tried to record his formula</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Load up on Europeans (the Wings have 11 on their roster, seven from Sweden); keep your character guys (Lidstrom, Tomas Holmstrom, Kris Draper, Darren McCarty and Kirk Maltby have all played on four Cup winners with Detroit); sign free agents who care more about winning than money (Chris Osgood, Dominik Hasek, Chris Chelios); and look for hidden gems in the higher rounds (Zetterberg was a seventh-round pick, Datsyuk a sixth-rounder).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I don’t know. A lot of those things seem like what any sensible coach would strive for, it’s just that Holland appears to be successful where others fall short. Which is to say the formula doesn’t answer the “why” question.</p>
<p><strong>Drafting:</strong> Namely Pavel Datsyuk, Henrik Zetterberg, and Nicklas Lidstrom. Plenty also threw their hats in for Chris Osgood. These guys are GREATS, no question. And more than that, they’ve all hung with the team longer than the average hockey player and seemed to only get better with age. Datsyuk, Zetterberg, and Lidstrom have been with the Red Wings more years collectively than I’ve been alive. That’s saying something, especially given all we’ve heard about concussions this year.</p>
<p>But when I see a list of names like that, I can’t help but wonder if it’s not the greats, but the not-as-greats that make all the difference. The Red Wings don’t rebuild, they reload, picking up guys who are low on profile and high on character.</p>
<p>Lots of teams have all-star players. Lots of teams <em>do not</em> exhibit consistent excellence the way the Red Wings do.</p>
<p><strong>Scouts:</strong> I have no idea how to analyze this because I don’t know any hockey scouts. The most I know about scouting comes from Moneyball and that’s baseball, so there you have it. Maybe they practice some sort of hocus pocus with a crystal ball, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>I have a hard time accepting that it’s just one of these things, though I suppose it could be all of them. Just a happy confluence of aligned hockey stars.</p>
<p>But those are largely intangibles. With no real way to measure what influences what, such an answer somehow feels hollow and dissatisfying, like the reverberation of a puck on the boards when you’ve shot wide of the net.</p>
<p>Maybe I — and the Flyers-shaped chip on my shoulder — am over-thinking it.</p>
<p>Why ARE the Red Wings so good?</p>
<p>The winner, as far as I’m concerned, came from WikiAnswers:</p>
<blockquote><p>i don&#8217;t know but they are</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It started when  Joel Zumaya faced <a target="new" href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/11/bad-news-for-joel-zumaya/">another setback</a>. Which would seem to be just a very Zumaya-esque form of horrible, gut-wrenchingly unfair luck for a kid who just seems so deserving of success&mdash;until I remembered reading <a target="new" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tom_verducci/03/08/stephen.strasburg.mechanics/index.html">this wonderful Sports Illustrated piece about Zoom Zoom&#8217;s mechanics</a>.</p>
<p>What? What? You mean to tell me that in the past 5 years, the Tigers&#8217; pitching staff hasn&#8217;t bothered to address Joel&#8217;s mother-trucking mechanics issues? </p>
<p>What do they do all day, if not work to protect and extend the life of one of their most promising young arms? As a mother&mdash;and we know I feel very maternally for Joel&mdash;I am fucking pissed. Chuck Hernandez, Rick Knapp, why haven&#8217;t you fixed this? The knock on Joel that he&#8217;s just fragile when, REALITY, he&#8217;s prone to injury because his MECHANICS ARE FAULTY&mdash;that&#8217;s your fault, Chuck, and yours too, Rick.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s your JOB to work on these issues. Now, before you get all whiny with me or explain how hard it is to alter some lifelong mechanics, let me say: bullshit. First, again, it is your job. Second, it is also Zumaya&#8217;s job. Third, what else do you have to do?</p>
<p>Example: I hired a coach. I have thrown sidearm, mechanically poor and physically prone to injury, since I was five. Now, 26 years later, it took less than 25 one-hour sessions to fix.  And I&#8217;m not even getting paid to throw! Now, if my coach&mdash;who is awesome, obviously&mdash;can fix my arm, why can&#8217;t a major league coach fix a relatively simple major league mechanical flaw?</p>
<p>It got me thinking about what appears to be a systemic issue for the Tigers: the coaching isn&#8217;t working, if it is happening at all.</p>
<p>Example: As I learned from watching Ken Burns&#8217; latest installment of <em>Baseball</em>, the reason the Yankees are dominant is because they fucking rock out at situational hitting. That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s not dumb luck that a soft single lands in right field on a full count after three foul balls with a man on third. It&#8217;s the product of months and years of practice.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox are also killer when it comes to situational hitting. The Twins work on it in batting practice&mdash;even before road games. The Tigers?</p>
<p>Well, as my friend Brett pointed out this weekend, the Tigers haven&#8217;t gotten any better at situational hitting or even baserunning in the past 5 years. (See: Will Rhymes&#8217; slide that featured him TOUCHING THE CATCHER&#8217;S GLOVE, essentially tagging himself out&mdash;because the umpire mistakenly thought the catcher had the ball in his glove.)</p>
<p>When you take a look at what&#8217;s plagued the Tigers for years now, it becomes obvious where the failure of coaching comes into play.</p>
<p>How do you lose a game 2-0 when Verlander pitches a gem? When you leave men on base, which the Tigers do <em>en masse</em> night after night after night.</p>
<p>Saturday, it was Magglio Ordonez swinging (for the fences) on the first pitch with the bases loaded. Fly ball out, side retired, goodnight. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s something deeply wrong with the approach to hitting taken by the hitting coach when a.) your 7,8,9 hitters fare better than your 1,2 hitters and b.) your hitters never seem to improve at situational hitting or plate patience.</p>
<p>How many times have we heard Jim Leyland, who we all know I absolutely adore, say after the game that we just didn&#8217;t hit the guys around? </p>
<p>What I want to know is what the repercussions are for it?</p>
<p>When I hack at pitches outside the strike zone during batting practice, my coach adds ten pushups to my payment. That&#8217;s right&mdash;I pay him, and he punishes me for getting lazy. What happens to Magglio, Jackson, Rhymes, etc., etc., etc.? What happens when the entire team is swinging for the fences instead of taking the outside pitch opposite field?</p>
<p>Nothing. Which must be true, because we have seen little improvement.  And really, who bothers to change if there are no consequences for staying the same?</p>
<p>People, something has to give. It&#8217;s time, as my friend Kyle mentioned, to give up this idea that only second basemen can hit second in the order. It&#8217;s time to jettison this BS nonsense of &#8220;saving&#8221; your quality relievers for the upcoming series or the later innings when it&#8217;s more important to win NOW, to hold the lead NOW. </p>
<p>(As another pal, Steve, pointed out – it&#8217;s not like the Tigers have lost the AL Central 2 of the last 4 years by one game and these early wins aren&#8217;t important. Oh, wait.)</p>
<p>None of this absolves Leyland.</p>
<p>Leyland has got to stop managing these talented players like they&#8217;re the Miami Heat. We&#8217;ve seen him go ballistic on umpires – I&#8217;d like him to unleash some of that on players who don&#8217;t do the little things it takes – and the big things it takes – to win.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe we don&#8217;t want a full-fledged Ozzie Guillen type management experience in Detroit, but I don&#8217;t think holding players accountable is over the top. </p>
<p>Including, obviously, their off the field issues. As my friend Shane often lambastes Mark Dantonio for not punishing his troublemaking players, I think it&#8217;s time for Leyland to come down on Cabrera for his off-the-field train wrecks.</p>
<p>This team needs something. It needs a kick in the pants. It needs Jim Leyland to channel Sparky Anderson and bench slackers, send down struggling players and challenge his boys to do more than the bare minimum.</p>
<p>This team needs a coaching staff that isn&#8217;t afraid of the players and isn&#8217;t lacksadasical about DOING THEIR FUCKING JOBS. That means getting Austin Jackson out of bed at 7 am, Lloyd, and hitting off the tee and then with a bullpen catcher pitching some live toss until he fixes his timing. You&#8217;re a hitting coach. This is an easy fix.</p>
<p>That means, Rick Knapp, fixing the mechanics of gunners like Zumaya and working with every pitcher in the rotation and the bullpen to pinpoint what they&#8217;re doing wrong – and fix it.</p>
<p>That means hiring a bench coach who isn&#8217;t going to shrink away from asking Miguel why he was running for home on a bloop single to left. That means getting in the face of Raburn when he airmails it from the outfield.</p>
<p>It means making clear whose asses are on the line, and whose are going to be benched and kicked.</p>
<p>It means no more ass kissing, bitches. I&#8217;m tired of seeing this sparkless, gutless baseball. If I wanted to see this, I&#8217;d play the Lions 0-16 season on repeat. </p>
<p>Do it right, or take your talents to South Beach. We don&#8217;t have time for prima donnas and half-assing it here.</p>
