										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>That is, I&#8217;m not quite done, but I&#8217;m <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>I own several of the Traveler&#8217;s Tales LEGO video games. I&#8217;ve played the first two <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games on my GameCube. I unlocked all of the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Jedi on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. I played <em>LEGO Batman</em> on my Playstation 2. I unlocked all the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Hero or True Villain on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. And now that I&#8217;ve played <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> on my Playstation 3, I think I can safely ignore <em>LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars</em>, and <em>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean</em>. </p>
<p>In fact, I don&#8217;t think I need to play a LEGO video game ever again.</p>

Annoying in the book. Annoying in the game.</p></div> According to <em>LEGO Harry Potter</em>&#8216;s completion stats, I&#8217;m 98.7% done. I&#8217;ve earned True Wizard on every level, collected all 20 of red bonus bricks, all 24 of the house crest pieces, unlocked 166 of the 167 characters, rescued 49 of the 50 students in peril, and collected 198 of the 200 gold bricks. Even for all this, I&#8217;m closer to done than it sounds. And further away. You earn a gold block for rescuing students, so I actually have just one student and one more gold brick to find. Finding all 200 gold bricks unlocks a bonus level, where I&#8217;d find the final character, Lord Voldemort. So I have just three tasks left to complete. Except that I can&#8217;t find that last student in peril, or that last gold brick. I&#8217;ve even consulted the cheat guides, but there are just too many students in peril, and too many gold bricks. I&#8217;m not sure which one of each is the one I&#8217;m missing, so I don&#8217;t know what to go looking for. I&#8217;ve tried to systematically make my way through Hogwarts, but clearly I&#8217;m missing something. And there&#8217;s a substantial amount of time involved in walking again through Hogwarts, with its many twists and turns, in anything resembling a thorough fashion.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not fun.</p>
<p>In another game, that might be less of a criticism. In another game, the rewards would be set up differently. I might need to spend more time grinding to bring my characters up to a level where they&#8217;re strong enough to explore a new area without getting killed, but the payoff would be new weapons and armor, new side quests and new storylines. I might have to keep practicing until I could jump and grab and balance just right, but the reward would be access to a new level with new challenges.</p>
<p>In the LEGO games, the only reward is the sense of completion. Lord Voldemort may be the final character, but within the LEGO games, all the members of a particular character class are pretty much identical, except for the aesthetics. There&#8217;s nothing that Lord Voldemort can do that any other dark wizard can&#8217;t do, except to earn me a couple of trophies. (Which again, give you nothing but bragging rights and a sense of completion.)</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6150" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6150" data-attachment-id="6150" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/1-flying_harry/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg" data-orig-size="720,405" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="1-Flying_Harry" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360" alt="Quidditch" title="1-Flying_Harry" width="640" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-6150" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=640&amp;h=360 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6150" class="wp-caption-text">Has anyone ever made sense of Quidditch? Or those white pants?</p></div>
<p>Even worse, when you do finally complete the game, there&#8217;s literally nothing else to do. Once you have 100% and all the trophies, there&#8217;s no reason to come back and keep playing. You really may as well just sell the game.</p>
<p>And at least for me, there&#8217;s something wrong with that. I <em>want</em> to have a reason to keep my old games on the shelf. It appeals to the collector in me. But as obsessive as I am, I still can&#8217;t justify holding on to a game where there&#8217;s actually less reason to play through a level once you&#8217;ve done it the first time. It&#8217;s still fun to ride around the Old West as John (or Jack) Marston. It&#8217;s still fun to solve the puzzles in <em>Portal</em> and <em>Portal 2</em>, and to stumble on a line of dialogue from GLaDOS or Wheatley that you missed the first time through. Once you&#8217;ve found all the hidden items in the LEGO games, however, they&#8217;re gone, so while most of the levels are designed to require at least two playthroughs to find all the bonus items, there&#8217;s no incentive to keep coming back. There&#8217;s actually less to each level than there was the first time through.</p>
<p>It may be part of the problem that I&#8217;m a <em>Harry Potter</em> fan, and the somewhat humorously mimed version of the storyline in the games actually impedes enjoyment of the game. It may be that the <em>Star Wars</em> movies were ripe for some light parody, and there are enough campy takes on the <em>Batman</em> rogues&#8217; gallery that the silly, over-the-top feel of the LEGO version seemed like a good fit. But the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe, as it develops, becomes much, much darker. Without that sense of genuine menace, there&#8217;s little reason to watch as several hundred pages of character and plot are crammed into a few minutes of animated charades.</p>
<p>More than anything else, my gameplay has become pathological. I&#8217;m searching and searching for those last few items just because I&#8217;m so close to that magical but totally arbitrary 100%. I&#8217;m frustrated, and I&#8217;m just wasting time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not having any fun.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t need to do that.</p>
<p>Unless they make another <em>Batman</em> game. . .</p>

For the most part, the player uses the Wii Remote turned on its side to resemble an NES controller. On a few levels, you can tilt the controller to tilt Kirby as a spherical yarn tank, or you draw a track on the screen for Kirby as a locomotive, but these are fairly rare exceptions.</p>

Keep in mind this is mostly speculation.</p></div> In light of the <a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/116/1164174p1.html" target="_blank">rumors of the controller design for Nintendo&#8217;s upcoming next-generation console</a>&mdash;which would appear to combine the functionality of a standard dual-joystick, multi-button console controller with the potential to act almost as a standalone portable game system&mdash;it looks like Nintendo may largely be ceding motion control to the more accurate PlayStation Move, and the more accessible (and downright revolutionary) XBox Kinect. In light of Nintendo&#8217;s domination of the portable gaming market, this may be a smart move. Given the increased prevalence of smartphones and tablets as portable game devices, creating a console that in effect bundles a portable game system could create a market for portable game downloads from consumers who would otherwise download an app for their iPhone rather than buy a 3DS.</p>
<p>That is, of course, assuming that people are going to have room in their bag for a console controller with a 6&#8243; screen. (And assuming that there&#8217;s any truth to the rumors at all.)</p>
<p>All the same, I was excited when I got the Wii to really explore what I hoped was going to be a totally different way of interacting with console games. I have to admit, that other than <em>Wii Sports</em> and <em>Wii Sports Resort</em>, I&#8217;ve largely been disappointed. How about it, dear readers, are there any really groundbreaking Wii motion-control based games that I need to get my hands on before I write off the Wii Remote as a fascinating experiment that was a clear marketing success, but a failure in terms of changing the way console games are designed and marketed?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> I discovered as I was digging through the online strategy guide that is keeping me progressing through <em>Uncharted: Drake&#8217;s Fortune</em> that the game has 15 chapters instead of 10. So I thought that I was almost halfway through the game last week on the verge of chapter 6, but I&#8217;m actually about halfway through the game this week a little bit into chapter 8. My first reaction was disappointment, since I thought I was just going to blaze through the game, but that&#8217;s settled a bit, as I&#8217;m still making good progress, and more importantly, I&#8217;m enjoying myself more. I haven&#8217;t hit any sections as hard as that first encounter with the pirates in chapter 4 seemed to be, and I&#8217;m not sure whether the fights are easer, or whether I&#8217;ve just gotten better. (Probably the former.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also pretty sure I know what the big twist is going to be, but no spoilers, please!</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Finally, all but replacing <em>Kirby&#8217;s Epic Yarn</em> in my current gameplay rotation is <em>LEGO Harry Potter</em>, which finally came down to $19.99. I had originally been excited by the idea of some cool wand action in the Wii version, but after playing <em>Kirby</em>, I realized that I couldn&#8217;t take that for granted, and just sprung for the PS3 version instead. (I&#8217;d be interested to know if anyone can report on the Wii version, since I don&#8217;t have another $20 to throw away on it. I need to save for <em>Portal 2</em>.)</p>
<p>First impressions are good. Not as great as <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/03/worth-the-wait/" target="_blank">LEGO Batman</a>, at least at first, but it still has the potential to earn a great deal of affection from me, if for no other reason than that this is the first Lego game I&#8217;ve played on the PS3, so it&#8217;ll be the first to give me trophies as I obsessively chase after all the characters, bonuses, house crests, etc., etc.</p>
<p>That is, if and when the PlayStation Network ever comes back up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Batman fans have suffered. Though many of us are avid video game players (it should be no surprise that a large portion of the demographics for  comic books and video games overlap), we’ve been presented with subpar game after subpar game. Jump, run, throw things, and repeat until you get to the guy with green hair.</p>
<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>But then, a couple of years ago, someone finally figured it out. After years of waiting, gamers were finally able to get their hands on an experience that really got the Dark Knight, that finally offered enough ins and outs to satisfy both the gamer and the comic book fan. We finally got what we were waiting for.</p>
<p>I am, of course, referring to <em>LEGO Batman</em>.</p>

I’ve fought my way past Victor Zsasz, beat up some thugs, and swung around from gargoyles. All of this was great fun, and I’m a huge Paul Dini fan. (Dini was responsible for the <em>Arkham Asylum</em> storyline, and was one of the primary writers for <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>. Also <em>LOST</em>.) But still, <em>Arkham</em> hasn’t quite sucked me in, and when it comes down to it, <em>LEGO Batman</em> beat it to the punch.</p>
<p>I was, in all honesty, a bit worried about <em>LEGO Batman</em> after having played the two <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games, which were wonderful. They were imaginative, clever, and funny. The Jedi characters could use the force to reshape their Lego-constructed environments, and the game was designed to reward replay. Each level had areas that could only be accessed when playing a second time in “Free Play” mode, where the player is given access to a set of alternate player characters, each with their own unique abilities.</p>
<p>Also, <em>LEGO Indiana Jones</em> was terrible. (I don’t really want to talk about it anymore.)</p>

While <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> created a number of distinct character classes, each of whom had a unique ability (Jedi, Dark Jedi, blaster characters, and Jar-Jar Binks, who can jump really high—yes, this is actually useful—and the second game expanded to include distinct abilities for Imperial characters and bounty hunters), in <em>LEGO Batman</em> most villains have a unique ability, and even Batman and Robin can perform different tasks by donning different ability suits.</p>
<p>Even better, <em>LEGO Batman</em>, compared to the <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games, is nearly two games rolled into one, as every storyline can be played from both Batman’s and the villains’ point of view, each with its own distinct levels.  In effect, you get to clean up the bad guys’ mess, and then go back and create it all over again.</p>

If you get tired of Batman and Robin, you can unlock Batgirl and Nightwing, who have similar abilities, but, well, look more awesome. Hidden within the character builder feature (which was available in the second <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> game, but didn’t seem to serve much of a purpose) are pieces that allow you to construct a number of secondary characters from the Batman comics such as Azrael and the Spoiler. (I play as the Spoiler all the time. Stephanie Brown doesn’t get near enough respect, and I was giddy when I found out she had been included. Azrael, on the other hand, can go to hell. Seriously. He sucks.)</p>
<p>I’m actually looking forward to giving <em>Arkham Asylum</em> another try. It&#8217;ll be worth it just to spend a little more time with Mark Hamill’s brilliant interpretation of the Joker. But there’s something a little bit wrong about the construction of a game like <em>Arkham Asylum</em>. When you really get into Batman, when you take the character seriously and try to envision <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/31/what-makes-the-bat/">a “realistic” take on what makes him tick</a>, you have to confront the fact that being the Batman is not and cannot be a very pleasant experience. Unless he’s a sadist (see Frank Miller’s <em>All-Star Batman and Robin</em>), he can’t really enjoy much what he does. There will always be someone he cannot save, all the way back to the parents who were murdered in front of his eyes. Thus, the more &#8220;realistic&#8221; a Batman game is, the less pleasant it should be to play.</p>
<p>Batman comics, however, are frequently unrealistic, constantly inventive, and a great deal of fun. Just like <em>LEGO Batman</em>.</p>
