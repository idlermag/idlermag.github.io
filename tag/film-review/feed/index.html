										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="It all ends" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allwelike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/harry-potter-4.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="427" />I haven’t read a word of the Harry Potter series. Not one word. My intentions to do so were fleeting and only arose once the people around me, the ones whose opinions I trust implicitly, began reading and recommending it to me. It all sounded good, but I was already three films deep at the time and those books are not short. In fact, nearly all of the films based on them clock in at well over two hours and I have yet to see one without someone complaining about something being left out.</p>
<p>So that ship had sailed. In all honesty, I almost didn’t get on board with the films either. Chris Columbus, director of <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em> (1987), <em>Home Alone</em> (1990) and <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em> (1993), is certainly competent, but he doesn’t exactly bring much to the table, and I was mostly underwhelmed by his interpretation of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em> (2001). It is a fine children’s film, but carries only a hint of what’s to come. He tackled the sequel, <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> (2002), with equal (lack of) flair and style. I was fond of Harry, but in the same way I’m fond of most of my extended family. “That was nice visit. See you in a few months.”</p>
<p>Then came Alfonso Cuaron, director of the fabulous Spanish film, <em>Y Tu Mama Tambien</em> (2001) and the third Harry Potter film, <em>The Prisoner of Azkaban </em>(2004). It was the first Potter flick I made a point of seeing in the theater. Call me a snob, but Cuaron’s name being mentioned lent a certain air of respect to what I had viewed as being largely children’s fare (albeit, better-than-average children’s fare). More mature, stylish and foreboding, <em>Azkaban</em> quickly became my favorite Potter film, establishing a vibe the series maintained throughout the rest of its impressive run.</p>
<p>Ever since <em>Azkaban</em> I have managed to see all but <em>Goblet of Fire (2005) </em>in theaters. The series has certainly become aesthetically brilliant, but the stories have matured as well. In fact, what’s most impressive to me about the Harry Potter series in general, aside from the engrossing story, aside from the large cast of unique, complicated characters, is the fact that J.K. Rowling has managed to craft a tale that has matured right along with its fan base. There are many Potterheads (is that a thing? If it isn’t, it should be) that started reading the series when they were young and, now in early adulthood, feel as though they have grown up with Harry and friends because, well, they have.</p>
<p>There is no better evidence of this than when Harry, gazing into the pensieve for the last time using Snape’s tear (I hear tell its brain matter or something in the book. I’m kind of okay with that change), sees visions of himself in the previous films. Even being what I would describe as a casual fan, it’s really something to take in what a journey these films (and books) have been for so many involved.</p>
<p>No, I have no plans to read the books now. I know how it ends. I have taken the trip, even with the inevitable shortcuts a film adaptation must take. I’m okay with that. I am not sad to see the series come to a close because all good things must come to an end, and Harry Potter and friends have a fine ending, indeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>The shotgun would ignite, and Ella Mae would scream, but Robert Ford would only lay on the floor and look at the ceiling, the light going out of his eyes before he could find the right words.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Finding “the right words” is a quest all writers are intimately familiar with. Everyone knows that it’s not what you say, but how you say it. Dialogue, great dialogue, can be like music, expressing the profound in a manner that can be universally understood and, more importantly, felt. Also, “nobody has gotten a hand job in cargo shorts since ‘nam!” is a pretty funny line.</p>
<p>I can recall times when a great line has saved a scene and, in some cases, an entire movie for me. In the best of times it is a cherry on top, as is the case with the quote preceding this piece. It is spoken by the narrator of <em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert</em> <em>Ford</em> (2007) in the film’s final moments. It is poetic, to be sure, but it is also the perfect summation of the character of Robert Ford, a man so starved for fame and the attention and validation that comes with it that it drove him to murder his idol.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the line, “<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/03/watching-a-sad-movie-why-dont-you-cry-about-it/">Say goodbye to Frankie, Dad</a>”, before, which functions as an exhaling of the long-held breath that is <em>In America </em>(2003). But that film is full of beautiful lines, made all the more beautiful by their context. One such scene involves Johnny, an Irish immigrant grieving the death of his son, playing with his two daughters. He chases them around their sad, dilapidated Hell’s Kitchen apartment blindfolded and crying, “Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Irish woman!” The girls scream with delight, but soon Johnny slips up: “Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Irish man!” He removes the blindfold and the game grinds to a halt, the girls peering out from their hiding places. He realizes that he was looking for his son. Johnny’s wife approaches.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Play with the girls, Johnny.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As stand alone lines they are unremarkable. Given their context – the idea that life goes on, that these children are still here and they need their father – they are quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Sometimes dialogue can serve to enhance the overall aesthetic of a film, as is the case with the Coen brother’s brilliant <em>Miller’s Crossing</em> (1990). It isn’t so much a gangster film as a film about gangster films, utilizing a stylized form of slang-laden dialogue (Twists = Women. You know, because they get you all twisted) fondly remembered in older films like <em>Little Caesar</em> (1931) and <em>White Heat</em> (1949). While <em>Miller’s Crossing</em> is full of brilliant dialogue, one exchange in particular stuck with me. Tommy, Irish gangster and mob bosses right hand man, has just punctuated a rousing verbal sparring match with a “twist” (a woman) by smashing her vanity mirror. As she casually strolls away, without even turning back to face him, she delivers this final blow:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I suppose you think you raised hell?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Tommy counters with, “<em>Sister, when I’ve raised hell you’ll know it”, </em>but we all know who won that argument.</p>
<p>There are film makers who have come to be at least partially defined by their dialogue. David Mamet, who doubles as a playwright, has a distinctive voice, his dialogue marching to its own beat. Take this exchange from the brilliant <em>Glenngarry Glen Ross </em>(1992):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You got leads. Mitch &amp; Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them. You can&#8217;t close the leads you&#8217;re given, you can&#8217;t close shit, *you are* shit, hit the bricks pal, and beat it, &#8217;cause you are going *out*.</em></p>
<p><em>The leads are weak.</em></p>
<p><em>“The leads are weak?” The fucking leads are weak? You’re weak. I’ve been in this business fifteen years!</em></p>
<p><em>What’s your name?</em></p>
<p><em>Fuck you. That’s my name. You know why, mister? ‘Cause you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight. I drove an eighty thousand dollar BMW. THAT’S my name.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Thomas Anderson’s characters will often make oddly formal, declarative statements. Like when Barry, from 2002’s <em>Punch Drunk Love</em> tells his brother-in-law that he “cries sometimes, for no reason,” then asks, “Can you help me?” His brother-in-law kindly responds by reminding Barry that he is a Chiropractor. There is also the put upon Donnie Smith from <em>Magnolia</em> (1999), who declares that he “has so much love to give. I just don’t know where to put it.”</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but what I’d really like to know is what some of your favorite lines or exchanges of dialogue are, and why? Seriously, don’t just feed me the dialogue. There has to be a reason it resonates with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year, upon learning about the inevitable release of the French animated film, <em>The Illusionist</em>, I wrote a piece expressing my love for its writer and inspiration, filmmaker Jacques Tati.</p>
<blockquote><p>French filmmaker Jacques Tati passed away on November 5th, 1982, but it would not be until 2010 that his swan song would be played.  It would come in the form of an animated film by the wonderfully talented Sylvain Chomet, who wrote and directed the equally wonderful <em>The Triplets of Belleville </em>(2003), and be written by Tati himself.  It will be called <em>The Illusionist</em>, and from what I have read and seen it should be the lovely send off Tati&#8217;s career deserves.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Tati &amp; the girl" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.the-filmreel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/illusionist_01.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="246" />Shortly following the post I had learned of a letter Tati’s grandson had sent to Roger Ebert stating that <em>The Illusionist</em> “<em>greatly undermines both the artistry of my grandfather&#8217;s original script whilst shamefully ignoring the deeply troubled personal story that lies at its heart</em>.&#8221; The personal story he speaks of is Tati&#8217;s abandonment of his illegitimate, first born daughter. I responded.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am an unabashed fan of Tati&#8217;s work.  His films make me smile like few can.  I am also of a mind that art and the artist can exist in their own context.  All of this leaves me with an interesting conundrum:  What do I <em>do</em> with this information?  Should I simply ignore it?  Can I?</p>
<p>It appears as though the heart of his grandson’s argument is that Tati had written the film&#8217;s script as an open letter to Helga Marie-Jeanne, the daughter he had abandoned.  He said that it stood as Tati&#8217;s only acknowledgement of her.  His claims that Sylvain Chomet and Pathe films deliberately eschewed this information for a more sentimental, decidedly pro-Tati approach is disheartening for a myriad of reasons.  Not the least of which being that sentimentality was exactly what I am hoping for.</p>
<p>I believe I will have to let the film speak for itself.  After all, I cannot force myself to view it one way or another.  I must admit that there is a large part of me that wishes I had never learned anything about Tati&#8217;s shame.  But perhaps I can still separate art and the artist and simply view the film as the closure of a fine career, if not the atonement he had intended it to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had intended to see <em>The Illusionist</em> in theatres, but never made it. I ended up viewing it at home courtesy of Netflix, long after the films original release date and, more importantly, long after learning of the film’s origins. It tells the story of an aging magician in a world that no longer has use for his magic. He is, quite clearly, Jacques Tati himself, the animation perfectly capturing his nuanced performance style. It was lovely to see him again.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="M. Hulot" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/mon_oncle_hulot.jpg?w=328&#038;h=262" alt="" width="328" height="262" />The illusionist eventually encounters a young woman who, good natured and, more importantly, sheltered, is still in awe of his magic. He falls in love with the way she looks at him, the way she makes him feel, and soon they are on the road together. I suppose that this relationship is meant to mirror what Tati had hoped for with his daughter, but his grandson implies that it was much more complicated than that. I am pleased to say that this didn’t occur to me even once while watching the film.</p>
<p>My time away had afforded me the luxury of viewing <em>The Illusionist</em> in exactly the manner I had mentioned; separating the art from the artist. I know little of Jacques Tati, the man. To me, he will always be Monsieur Hulot, a man confounded and delighted by the world around him.</p>
<blockquote><p>For any fan of the silent film, Monsieur Hulot should be placed alongside Charlie Chaplin&#8217;s &#8220;The Tramp&#8221; as an icon of the genre.  This is, of course, regardless of the fact that none of Tati&#8217;s Hulot films were actually silent.  Though the characters around him spoke quite frequently, Monsieur Hulot could not be bothered.  He spoke through his body, letting his lanky frame and polite gesturing do the work for him.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the last moments of <em>The Illusionist</em>, after having decided to leave the young woman with her new suitor, Tati, the illusionist, leaves behind a note reading: <em>Magicians do not exist</em>. Perhaps he’s right? Perhaps that was the films way of telling us to take Tati and his films as they are? None of us are perfect, but for me, Tati’s films always will be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Best Cinematography:</strong> Matthew Libatique for <em>Black Swan</em>, Wally Pfister for <em>Inception</em>, Danny Cohen for <em>The King’s Speech</em>, Jeff Cronenweth for <em>The Social Network</em>, Roger Deakins for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="True Grit" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/truegrit.gif?w=297&#038;h=198" alt="" width="297" height="198" />My pick:</strong> Roger Deakins for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong>Probable winner:</strong>Jeff Conenweth for <em>The King’s Speech</em></p>
<p><em>Black Swan</em>&#8216;s gritty, realistic visuals provide a striking counterpoint to the madness it contains and Cohen’s use of wide angle lenses and tight close-ups in <em>The King’s Speech</em> make for a unique looking film within a pretty traditional genre. <em>The Social Network</em>&#8216;s look is dark, ambient and cold (in a good way). I’m not sure <em>Inception</em>&#8216;s greatness owes much to the cinematography, but it’s a well-shot film to be sure.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The King's Speech" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/rpowell/pic/001c70t7/s640x480" alt="" width="307" height="205" />Even though I don’t often condone giving an artist an award for past work (unless we’re talking about a lifetime achievement award, of course), Roger Deakins really is about due. I won’t waste time listing all of his work but he’s shot one gorgeous film after another in his <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005683/">long career</a> including nearly every Coen brothers film since <em>Barton Fink</em> in 1991. <em>True Grit</em> is beautiful, subtle and by far my favorite in this category. Jeff Cronenweth will take it.</p>
<p><strong>Best Directing:</strong> Darren Aronofsky for <em>Black Swan</em>, David O. Russell for <em>The Fighter</em>, Tom Hooper for <em>The King’s Speech</em>, David Fincher for <em>The Social Network</em>, Joel &amp; Ethan Coen for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="The Social Network" src="https://i0.wp.com/clothesonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/The-Social-Network_Jesse-Eisenberg-dressing-gown_Image-credit-Columbia-Pictures.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192" />My pick: </strong>David Fincher</p>
<p><strong>Probable winner</strong>: David Fincher</p>
<p>Darren Aronovsky’s commitment to the madness is admirable and Tom Hooper’s unique style adds much to <em>The King’s Speech</em>. O. Russell’s <em>The Fighter</em> looks pretty good, but the fight sequences leave much to be desired, and even though it’s incredibly difficult for me to pass up the Coen brothers here I think the cinematography and performances are the real standouts for <em>True Grit</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Social Network" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.latinoreview.com/images/stories/blu-ray_dvd-screencaps-3/soc-net-end.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="182" />In the end I have to go with what seems to be the popular opinion and give this to Fincher. Keeping such a fast paced, intelligent film under such tight control is impressive and Fincher’s a master.</p>
<p><strong>Best Picture:</strong> <em>Black Swan</em>, <em>The Fighter</em>, <em>Inception</em>, <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, <em>The King’s Speech</em>, <em>127 Hours</em>, <em>The Social Network</em>, <em>Toy Story 3</em>, <em>True Grit</em>, <em>Winter’s Bone</em></p>
<p><strong>My pick: <img class="aligncenter" title="The Social Network" src="https://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2010/10/01/technology/Harvard_Social_Network.fortune/social_network_harvard.top.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="324" /></strong></p>
<p>There’s no need to go into great detail as my previous posts in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/category/the-cinephiles/the-great-oscar-race-the-cinephiles/">The Great Oscar Race</a> already do so. Critics have called this a down year. I suppose they’re somewhat correct. Most of the films in this category are very good, but few are great. Perhaps someone should recommend going from ten to five films? There I go again.</p>
<p>Narrowing this oversized (sorry) category down to a top three was easy for me. <em>True Grit</em>, <em>Winter’s Bone</em> and <em>The Social Network</em> were my clear standouts. But if I had to pick a film that really represents a total package, a perfect storm of cinematic brilliance, if you will, I’d have to take <em>The Social Network</em>. It’s just too well made, too well acted and too damned smart to ignore. It’s also better than a film about Facebook has any right to be.</p>
<p>That being said, <em>The King’s Speech</em> has gained so much momentum at this point that anything else winning (except maybe <em>The Social Network</em>) would be considered a fair sized upset.  We shall see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Probable winner: <img class="aligncenter" title="The King's Speech" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Kings-Speech-Geoffrey-Rush.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="284" /></strong></p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have failed. I have fallen one movie short in the Best Picture category and four short of my overall goal. Thirteen films in three weeks can be tricky business for a married fellow with obligations. Damn you <em>127 Hours</em> for not being as easily accessible as your fellow nominees! Damn you weather for thwarting my attempts to see Michelle Williams’ performance in <em>Blue Valentine</em>! Damn you <em>Rabbit Hole</em> for slipping so far under the radar that even I, a die-hard cinephile, completely forgot that you exist! And lastly, damn me for not making time to see <em>The Illusionist</em>. As a huge Jacques Tati fan I have no excuse. Perhaps I can make up for it?</p>
<p>Until then, I soldier on with my picks, spending more time in categories I feel the most versed in and deferring to rumor and pure vibe in the others.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actor in a Leading Role:</strong> Javier Bardem in <em>Biutiful</em>, Jeff Bridges in <em>True Grit</em>, Jesse Eisenberg in <em>The Social Network</em>, Colin Firth in <em>The King’s Speech</em>, James Franco in <em>127 Hours</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Jeff Bridges" src="https://i1.wp.com/manolomen.com/images/jeff-bridges.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="252" /><img class="alignright" title="Colin Firth" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/files/2011/01/Colin_Firth_and_Barbara_Stockings_cropped.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="249" />My pick:</strong> Jeff Bridges</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner:</strong> Colin Firth</p>
<p>This one’s a no-brainer. Firth has so much buzz at this point that you can’t even hear the other actors’ names. It is deserved, of course. His performance in <em>The King’s Speech</em> is subtle and endearing. Eisenberg is good, but David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin are really the guys carrying <em>The Social Network</em>. Javier Bardem’s role is a little overly sentimental and James Franco is the bleeding host of the show! His odds plummeted the minute they made the announcement.</p>
<p>So why Jeff Bridges? I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that some of it is because I’m a huge Jeff Bridges fan, but I’m always impressed when an actor manages to vanish into a role and I feel like he accomplishes that in his performance as Rooster Cogburn. Sure, he’s a funny, drunken, dirty cowboy. But the real elegance in his performance comes from the more subtle moments, like the slight shift in his demeanor when he watches young Mattie Ross basically will her horse across a river in order to exchange words with him. Unfortunately, Bridges won last year for his equally phenomenal performance in a less phenomenal movie (<em>Crazy Heart</em>) and the Academy isn’t terribly fond of repeats.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actor in a Supporting Role: </strong>Christian Bale in <em>The Fighter</em>, John Hawkes in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, Jeremy Renner in <em>The Town</em>, Mark Ruffalo in <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, Geoffrey Rush in <em>The King’s Speech</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="John Hawkes" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.wikia.com/lostpedia/images/4/42/John_Hawkes.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="320" /><img class="alignright" title="Christian Bale" src="https://i2.wp.com/images.askmen.com/specials/2007_top_49/men/christian_bale.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="290" />My pick: </strong>John Hawkes</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner: </strong>Christian Bale</p>
<p>Mark Ruffalo is charming as the über-cool Paul and Geoffrey Rush is as reliable as ever as the future King’s speech therapist. I haven’t seen <em>The Town</em>, but based on his performance in <em>The Hurt Locker</em> last year I have to imagine that Jeremy Renner is solid. But again I find myself leaning towards the more subtle performance, the one that doesn’t feel like a performance at all, and that’s John Hawkes in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>. This is not as to say that I don’t think Christian Bale deserves recognition for his work in <em>The Fighter</em> as it really is his movie, as far as I’m concerned, and his physical transformations are always impressive. It’s just that I liked <em>Winter’s Bone</em> so much more and John Hawkes is just so damned good as the hard edged, distrustful drug addict, Uncle Teardrop. The main character’s journey may lead her to some sort of catharsis but Teardrop’s is one of near-Shakespearian tragedy, and his final line is a heavy one.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actress in a Leading Role: </strong>Annette Bening in <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, Nicole Kidman in <em>Rabbit Hole</em>, Jennifer Lawrence in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, Natalie Portman in <em>Black Swan</em>, Michelle Williams in <em>Blue Valentine</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Jennifer Lawrence" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.comicbookmovie.com/images/uploads/Lawrence_sd420080713.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="297" /><img class="alignright" title="Natalie Portman" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/natalie-portman-teeth.jpg?w=231&#038;h=308" alt="" width="231" height="308" />My pick: </strong>Jennifer Lawrence</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner: </strong>Natalie Portman</p>
<p>This was a tough one for me. Having not seen both <em>Rabbit Hole</em> and <em>Blue Valentine</em> I can only guess as to whether or not they deserve to win it. Meanwhile, I loved <em>Black Swan</em> which contained a daring all-in performance from Natalie Portman, and Jennifer Lawrence’s more subtle portrayal of determined young woman in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, as well. My heart tells me that I got more satisfaction from the later, but my head tells me that the former is nearly unbeatable.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actress in a Supporting Role: </strong>Amy Adams in <em>The Fighter</em>, Helena Bonham Carter in <em>The King’s Speech</em>, Melissa Leo in <em>The Fighter</em>, Hailee Steinfeld in <em>True Grit</em>, Jacki Weaver in <em>Animal Kingdom</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Hailee Steinfeld" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.enthunder.com/photo/Hailee%20Steinfeld/Hailee-Steinfeld.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="284" /><img class="alignright" title="Hailee Steinfeld" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.enthunder.com/photo/Hailee%20Steinfeld/Hailee-Steinfeld.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="285" />My pick:</strong> Hailee Steinfeld</p>
<p><strong>Probable winner: </strong>Hailee Steinfeld</p>
<p>Amy Adams is solid as the outspoken girlfriend of “Irish” Mickey Ward in The Fighter, but she’s done even better work in far better films. Melissa Leo is excellent, but her character isn’t strong enough to leap out and Leo may have shot herself in the foot with her odd decision to <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/oscar-melissa-leo-goes-rogue-with-her-own-personal-campaign-ads/">fund her own “For your consideration” ads</a>. Helena Bonham Carter’s part isn’t showy enough no matter how well she played it and I’m not certain that Animal Kingdom got enough attention for Jacki Weaver to snag it.</p>
<p>This is another no brainer for me: Hailee Steinfeld. It’s a shame she was nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar when <em>True Grit</em> was clearly her film, but I’d imagine that injustice will not weigh on her much as she’s giving her acceptance speech.</p>
