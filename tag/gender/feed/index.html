										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Schumer’s first hour-long special, “Mostly Sex Stuff,” recently aired on Comedy Central. I’ve read some negative reviews claiming that she’s just another typical female comedian, oversexed, and too caught up in talking about dating, but I tend not to agree. One brilliant internet dude claims that we shouldn’t bother with Amy because if we’ve seen Chelsea Handler’s, Natasha Legerro’s, or Whitney Cumming’s acts we’ve seen Schumer’s. Because women are all the same. The fellas from the <em>Never Not a Nerd Show</em> explain that there are women who are funny socially or as writers, but as one nerd put it, “I’ve never seen stand-up from a woman that’s not “here’s me banging dudes. . .” and “being a girl is hard and vaginas are weird &#8212; that’s the other thing they [female stand-ups] have.” I’d like to go on the record with my own little review because men aren’t the only ones who can plaster their opinions all over the internet. And also because my opinions are better.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10416" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10416" data-attachment-id="10416" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/22/schumer-humor/amyschumer1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg" data-orig-size="330,385" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="amyschumer1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=257" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=330" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=640" alt="Amy Schumer" title="amyschumer1"   class="size-full wp-image-10416" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg 330w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=129 129w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=257 257w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10416" class="wp-caption-text">Amy Schumer</p></div> Ultimately, I thought the show was pretty great and I’m pleased to see that Amy is getting the air-time she deserves. Her persona is sharp as she playfully places a dark edge on her exaggerated and cutesy feminine mannerisms. Schumer’s style is all about inviting us into a familiarly gendered space and then exploding, or at least surprising, us out of it. She chats with her audience as though we are a gaggle of gal pals, and telling us about “mostly sex things” she takes us along on her adventures in dating, relationships, and more casual encounters.  Oozing with sarcasm she lulls everyone into the rhythm of the staid stereotypical (female) stand-up.  “Am I right, ladies?” she asks. When she gets a reaction from the crowd, “Thanks, sister-friends!”  But sandwiched in the “Ohmygawd, I’m a girl!” banter is a joke about being tested for AIDS, or how much of a boundary-blind cunt her mom is, or the time her boyfriend wanted to discuss the possibility of bringing assplay into their bedroom. I believe that last joke ended with her calling his bluff, his delicately placing one finger atop her anus, and her giving him the fisting of a lifetime. Yeah. And then she giggles, makes dolly eyes, and twirls her hair a bit.  I love it.  </p>
<p>Though her hour-long show sagged a bit in parts, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her observations, stories, or subject matter. Rather, it seems she has a unique rhythm and her strengths lie in her bracketed offbeats on the way to telling a larger joke. Let me explain what I mean, here. With the fisting joke, the punchline comes quite appropriately with the fisting, but she goes on to give some extra info &#8212; “He’s dead now.” That little line is so powerful. It’s unnecessary, but its excessiveness builds the enjoyment of the previous joke. Likewise, when she’s telling a tale about a man commenting on her “sturdy” build, she parenthetically adds, “He was from Texas. . . or some place I’m not going.”  These little extras, these bits of information that distract from the main focus, can add to the realistic feel of listening to a friend chatting while further playing up her critique of the “privileged white girl” character. </p>
<p>Though one could argue that this isn’t really new territory as one-liners were once the comedy norm, the way she weaves a number of tight and punchy one-liners into a larger set of more complex stories is impressive and really her own.  What she’s doing with her act is strong, but in an hour-long show all those fragments can create some weird beats and awkward pauses.  Yes, in this special not all of her transitions were exactly seamless, but as a young comic, she’s got plenty of time to perfect her timing and flow and work these issues out.  </p>
<p>If my critical breakdown of Schumer humor sucked the life out of all things comedic, perhaps I can sway you with some of the show’s high points that really worked and tickled my funny bone. </p>
<ul>
<li>On being a child and seeing her mom’s bushy pubic hair situation for the first time: &#8220;Is Mom being swarmed by BEES?&#8221;</li>
<li>On seeing an uncircumcised penis for the first time: (on phone) &#8220;Mom, can you come pick me up? . . . I don’t know &#8212; It’s wearing like a hat, or a cape. . . I don’t know!&#8221;</li>
<li>On using a toilet at a club after she assures us she’s not going to say anything gross: &#8220;So, there I was, just dropping a TON of heat. . . just massacring this bowl. . . I’m texting people, &#8216;Am I DYING?'&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>See?  She’s got the funny. She’s got the chops. She’s got boobs and vag and miraculously these body parts aren’t holding her back.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, the show is worth watching. If you know her work, you’ll see Schumer branching out a bit in places while also honing the voice she’s created. Sure, I’m excited to see her go a little deeper and lend more time to her discussions of class, race, feminism, and stand-up itself, but these things will come with time. I say, don’t listen to the internet guys who suggest you avoid her work for being too girly. (How quickly men forget how often we’ve patiently listened to their sex stories and their detailed depictions of their nether regions.) I say, nut up and imagine what it’s like to have an ovary for a second, fellas. What doesn’t kill you will make you stronger. . . and perhaps more highly educated, and worthier adversaries as fellow nerds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMC’s much anticipated <em>Mad Men</em> premiere came and went this past Sunday night and boy did it leave me feeling. . . funny.  This show that once revelled in style, laid on the cool and laid it on thick, has definitely gone through some changes.  Following Don Draper’s lead, where the feel was once confident, sexy, defiant, and unapologetically mysterious, it has now become heavily marked by paranoia, aggression, alienation, and tangible nervousness.  It’s not that these latter qualities haven’t always been there, I’d argue they have, it’s just that in this most recent season opener anxiety engenders the characters’ world much more completely. Fear is encroaching, and that beautiful coolness of old is hardly believable or available for our retro TV friends.  While I watched the premiere, it was joking and bad jokes that both caught my attention and best help me explain the feelings of discomfort creator Matt Weiner seems to be exploring this season.  </p>
<p>First of all, the show is framed with some pretty heady political issues made light of by The (proverbial) Man in each instance. The first image we see is that of a group of black men and women protesting for equal rights outside of Y&amp;R, a rival ad company. Upstairs in the building, a couple of idiot ad men ridicule the protesters claiming they should shut up and get jobs instead of walking around in circles. Noting the literal meteorological heat &#8212; if not the metaphorical kind &#8212; our privileged white man-children then pummel the crowd below with makeshift ice-water balloons. The joke only becomes unfunny to these fellows when the crowd comes upstairs and a woman (quite maternally) admonishes them for having hit not only fellow people, but a child, as well.  </p>
<p>Seeing this as a viewer feels strange and uncomfortable for many reasons.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> This is an ugly part of our country’s history and we’re seeing it played out again from the perspective of the privileged majority.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Mad Men</em> rarely takes up racial issues, often choosing to only glance at or gesture toward their existence. If you’re a fan of <em>Mad Men</em>, this scene further reminds you that hey, maybe such plot points should have been part of the storylines all along.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Though it’s good that we’re finally offered a more direct racial encounter on the show, it is still on the fringes of the real (read: white) story.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>  And if actual race relations and characters of color are going to miraculously become much more prevalent to the storylines, is the show going to do it clunkily/offensively or well?  Eep!</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m nervous about how this will be handled.  I already felt more than a little distressed by the good vs. evil melodrama in this episode. When the woman scolds the ad men she proudly, boldly huffs, “and they call us savages.”  I just hope that Weiner’s response this season is not a “noble savage” resolution to a white guilt problem. </p>

<p>Another political joke gone wrong? To really stick it to the bigoted guys from Y&amp;R and create a lot of buzz about the “good guys” at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, the company publishes an ad (that they can’t really afford) claiming they’re hiring a secretary, and unlike some other places, they’re an equal opportunity employer.  Take that Y&amp;R!  And there was much laughing and drinking of cocktails. . . that is until, as Roger so eloquently puts it, “the lobby is full of negroes.”  The team’s expensive little joke gets a little more expensive as now there’s pressure to not just talk the talk of their joke’s setup, but actually hire a person of color on staff.  This could be the transitional moment for both the office and the show, but it may be a token one and lodged in a joke at that.  Again, I felt a little funny about this.  Funny weird, not funny ha-ha.</p>
<p>But, the societal upheaval bits were mostly bookends; per usual, the camera was more firmly focused on the typical cast of characters and their dramas and growing pains.  Don Draper is turning the big 4-0 (alter ego Dick Whitman has been forty for half the year) and though he tries to play it off, this turn of events seems to shake him.  Don has settled down a little, is enjoying the comforts of wife (the second) and home and family.  He makes breakfast, he appears to follow up on his fatherly promises.  Ah, seems pretty nice and domestic for old Don!  Driving the kids back to their mother’s ghastly large estate he even jokes to “say hi to Morticia and Lurch.”  Funnier than this though was when he asks his sweet kiddies, “How old will I be when you’re forty?” His son quickly answers, “You’ll be dead.”  If you’ve been thinking, “This is Don’s world and we’re just living in it,” well, his son’s laconic statement about the fleeting nature of life and the revolutionary power of time might just change your mind.  </p>
<p>Megan, Don’s upgraded secretary, is young and lithe and lovely and only further makes a farce of the possible downfall of Draper. Her role in the episode is mostly to be peachy and youthful, impetuous and girlish. Throwing together a surprise party for Don at the last minute completely throws the office for a loop.  The late invitation, while just a fun whim to Megan, reads to the advertisers (you know, those makers and sellers of hidden meaning) as a harbinger of doom.  “Why was I invited so late?” “ Have I done something to be downgraded?” “ Am I getting fired?” “ Am I not fun at parties?”  Nobody knows where they fit in, if their office is good enough, if they’re even happy.  At the party itself, Megan is having a gay old time laughing the night away with a homosexual black man (oh, little miss counterculture!) while Roger gently has to assure Don that they aren’t laughing at him.  </p>

<p>Okay, here’s the bit you’ve probably heard a lot about. Megan performs a ridiculous french pop song and dance for Don at the party.  I guess it’s the French-Canadian version of the Marilyn “Happy Birthday.”  It was so cheesily bad that I kind of loved it, but again &#8212; awkward!  It was too sexy and intimate for a group of coworkers, who are basically strangers.  The twee-ness of the performance prickled against its audience and the dissonance was palpable. And the even weirder thing that follows is Don’s reaction to the ordeal.  </p>
<p>Anyone could see this was a stupid idea, this dumb surprise &#8212; Peggy claims the scenario has Lucy Ricardo written all over it &#8212; so, I wasn’t shocked that Draper was pissed and the Mrs. was pouty.  What was bizarre was the cleaning scene that takes place post-party.  Stripped down to her perfectly matching and tres sexy skivvies, Megan throws herself into tidying the living room&#8230;you know, like you do.  She starts yelling at Don to stop looking at her that he can’t have it, the looking, or her, the person, which apparently melts Don’s anger and turns him on to no end. UGH. Cue an aggressive physical struggle that boils over into passion and ends with a discussion about the once beautiful white carpet the party (and this disgusting rape fantasy) has sullied.  The white carpet is so lovely, so chic, it’s what everyone wants or thinks they want, but it’s completely impractical.  It can’t withstand life without being changed or destroyed.  Megan is disappointed and upset that a new one will be necessary.  Don, from the marketing perspective, has always been aware that you need multiple white carpets to sell the illusion of the perfect one.  There’s a lot going on here. </p>
<p>Though I was pretty disgusted by the bizarre sexual display, I think (I hope) it was there to make us feel gross.  We can read this moment as a nasty reminder of how desperate Don is behind his mask of dapper masculinity.  Truthfully, he doesn’t really know what he wants or needs &#8212; he makes his decisions based on what people tell him he should desire or what he shouldn’t dare to take.  His persona is attractive, but empty and reliant upon women and others lower than him in the hierarchy.  He has all the set pieces of a good life, but there is no concrete experience of happiness he can cling to &#8212; he’s still going to die some day.  It’s only in the practice of forcibly taking, or owning, or exerting power that he appears passionate. In a culture of comparison, he and the other characters are better at figuring out if they look happy than they are at comprehending/experiencing satisfaction.</p>
<p>Everyone, I mean everyone is makes fun of Don, but Roger assures him it’s only because he’s happy. </p>
<p>Is <em>Mad Men</em> trying to figure out what its idea of happiness really is?  Don does have the immaculate white carpet, a wife willing to sully it with a party, a nameless (black? brown?) girl to come in and clean it, and the money to replace it if he pleases.  I imagine this season will further suss out what it means to be happy for each of our regular characters and maybe a few new ones.  At this point the only difference seems to be having the power to be in on, or at least aware of, the jokes instead of being completely alienated by them.</p>

<p>I am a bit late to the Russell Brand boat, I think. My brushes with current pop culture are piecemeal and oddball, and mainstream stuff tends to pass me by. Although Russell Brand is only recently mainstream, I think. At least in America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first saw Brand in what I believe were the commercials for his 2008 hosting of the MTV Music Video Awards. My reaction was, &#8220;Wow, that guy is really, really hot,&#8221; and I didn’t consider much more beyond that. If I think a man is hot, I assume he will also be a d-bag. This in no way reflects anything about the men I cast these aspersions on, but instead says loads about my own secret preconceptions.</p>
<p>So apart from random sightings here and there, I didn’t run into Brand again until I saw <em>Hop</em> (2011), a movie which I went to see solely because it had bunnies, and a movie which I think would’ve not worked nearly as well if it weren’t for Brand’s voicing of the main &#8220;bunneh.&#8221; I was smitten. &#8220;Who is this guy?!&#8221; I thought. Hello, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand" target="new">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brand has been a vegetarian since the age of 14&#8230; describ[es] himself as looking like an &#8220;SM Willy Wonka&#8230;&#8221; he has suffered from bulimia, and also went through a period of self harm&#8230; Brand is a former heroin, sex addict, and a recovering alcoholic.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was intrigued. This reflects even more about my unseemly personal fixations.</p>

And here is where I officially fell in love:</p>
<blockquote><p>We all have an essential self, but if you spend every day chopping up meat on a slab, and selling it by the pound, soon you’ll find you’ve become a butcher. And if you don’t want to become a butcher (and why would you?), you’re going to have to cut right through to the bare bones of your own character in the hope of finding out who you really are. Which bloody hurts.</p></blockquote>
<p>You might think that a memoir written by a man which has a predominant focus on promiscuous sex with women would not be relatable to a woman. And perhaps I am not a typical woman (okay, I am definitely not a typical woman), but I have rarely read writing about this particular type of sexuality that I could so thoroughly relate to. In fact, only one time did I encounter a person whose sexuality I understood more, and that time, I moved in with him.</p>
<p>The aspect of wanting to be needed and needing to be wanted and misguidedly searching for self-esteem through sex has been extensively chronicled in writing about women’s sexuality. But not so much the eroticism or pleasure-seeking that can sometimes exist alongside it; making the whole foray all the more difficult to navigate. With so much emphasis on how damaged women use sex as a substitute for acceptance or affection, or how casual sex is detrimental to women’s self esteem—all things which are absolutely and completely true—the visceral factor of how actual desire and libido play into self-destructive sex is somehow ignored in women’s sex studies. I don’t think these feelings are absent for women; I think they are unaccounted for. I think women don’t talk about them because 1.) Other women aren’t talking about them, and 2.) Whenever women say they might maybe, possibly be horny, they know they are opening themselves up to be a target for men who take any show of sexuality as consent for any sexual activity, with anyone. You know, even if the woman is kicking and screaming and trying to get away. Because the world is shitty like that.</p>

It would be sexist of me to suggest that a male has a somehow closer understanding of fringe female sexuality because he has an eating disorder and self-harm in his history, afflictions more commonly found in women. Although it may be worth examining once you realize you’re looking at the cause and effect backwards: the feelings are precursive to the behavior of these self-inflicted afflictions, not the other way around. Feelings of worthlessness and aloneness, of abandonment and wanting to be saved.</p>
<p>I also think it does Brand a disservice to imply that the way he experiences feelings about sex are in any way female, because his sexuality is very decidedly male (hubba!), and I don’t believe all sex motivations necessarily need to be gendered in that way. But I’m willing to bet that women who’ve had complicated sexual lives will read the things he says and go, &#8220;Dude, I feel you, man. I so do.&#8221; Which can really only serve to get him laid even more (I know he’s married now to Katy Perry—I’m just sayin’).</p>
<p>And from a comic aspect, Brand’s sex humor is also somehow more inclusive than many other male comedians, even though it’s no less vulgar and rude. The way Denis Leary talked about orgasms in his <em>Lock N Load</em> show, for instance, felt very segregating to the sexes. I don’t even mean there’s anything wrong with that; there will always be a place in comedy for that type of gender differentiating humor, both for men and women. But Brand’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEUpm3tSx5w" target="new">routine about the differences in the pre-ejaculatory versus the post-ejaculatory mindsets</a> in his <em>Russell Brand: Live in New York</em> show was so refreshingly universal. His bit about &#8220;seagulling&#8221; had me tearing up from laughter and joy, with the feeling that, &#8220;Man, somebody gets it.&#8221; It’s unsurprising to hear that Brand was raised by his mother and grew up chiefly around women. Someone who can talk about desiring women in a way that’s very base but also extremely respectful is walking a pretty impressive, modern and complex tightrope. You go, Russell—Go on my son.</p>
