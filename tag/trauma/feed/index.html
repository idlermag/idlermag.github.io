										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ll let you in on a little secret. I’ve wanted to write this column since before I had a column to write. And I’ve had butterflies in my stomach about it for almost just as long. <em>Batgirl</em>, and by extension its cowl-bearing character Barbara Gordon, isn’t just my favorite book on the stands. She’s my favorite idea in comics. Ever. Barbara is, to me, the pinnacle of what a comic book character can achieve: she’s known to millions but ever-evolving, developed out of a greater tradition but stands independent of it, and above all, is someone fans can aspire to be more like &#8212; in more ways than just one. Over the last 45 years, Barbara Gordon has meant so much to so many different people. This is what she means to me.</p>

<p>From her first appearance in 1967, a coordinated effort between legendary DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz and the producers of the <em>Batman</em> television series,<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> it was clear this new Batgirl was going to stand apart from other superheroes. On the very first story page of <em>Detective Comics</em> #359, Barbara lays it all out for the reader &#8212; she has earned a Ph.D., graduated summa cum laude, and wears a brown belt in Judo &#8212; in that order. No wonder she became a visible inspiration for educated women, and especially librarians, in the years that followed. Brains first, physical achievement second is the subtext for so much of Barbara’s career, and remains to this day one of the reasons she resonates so personally with so many. Never a romantic interest for headlining hero Batman, this Batgirl could be regarded as his peer by the readers (and the Dark Knight himself) in the way few other heroines were to date. A powerful symbol for the emerging female empowerment movement of the late 1960s, Barbara raced on her motorcycle across the television screen as the first female superhero to grace that medium, instantly becoming a household name to millions.</p>
<p>This is where I first encountered Barbara, or “Babs” as she is known to her close friends &#8212; among whom I generously count myself. Not in 1967, mind you, but in syndicated reruns years later as a child of 6 or 7, who would rush home from school every day to see what was popping up on <em>Batman</em>. Some kids got excited about the Joker or the Riddler or whatever villain of the week was appearing. Me? It was the roar of that motorbike that I was waiting for, as well as the “BONG!” that appeared as an animated Batgirl swung across the opening credits and kicked a nasty thug in the face. Like many gay kids (and I promise, I absolutely knew I was homosexual even then), seeing a strong female character on television substituted for the absolute lack of gay characters on screen and in books. Batgirl was the outsider coming in, wanting to be accepted by the dynamic duo, but always having to keep secrets to protect her identity, even from the best of friends and most trustworthy gents around. She was charming, smart, determined and didn’t let anyone tell her she couldn’t accomplish what she set out to do. It also helped that her costume was just a little bit more fabulous than those donned by Batman and Robin. No surprise, a sparkly purple unitard goes a long way towards winning my heart, even to this day. But back then, she was an inspiration to me &#8212; an acknowledgement that being smart and talented could get me where I wanted to go, even if there were massive obstacles in my way.</p>
<p>Barbara Gordon represented that optimistic reality for many women and gay men I know, and, in the comics, she never let up. In 1972, Babs was elected to higher office, the same year only 15 of 535 members of Congress were women in real life. By the early 1980s, it was well established that she knew the secret identities of Batman and Robin all along. As she put it in <em>Detective Comics</em> #526, “I’m not stupid &#8212; and I am a detective.” But even as it seemed Batgirl was rising to the top of the comic book food chain, early signs of trouble surfaced for Babs in the form of an eponymous special issue (her first) in 1988. Written by Barbara Randall Kesel and drawn by Barry Kitson, “The Last Batgirl Story” was a foreboding, but genuinely brilliant mystery wherein Barbara needs to overcome the trauma of a near-death experience in the field to stop a series of murders plaguing Gotham City.</p>

<p>What was so remarkable about the story was that it didn’t sexualize Barbara’s trauma. Like any cop or soldier injured in the course of doing their job, Batgirl went through a period of recovery for both body and mind, but she didn’t let fear overcome her sense of duty. She was driven to get right back into the costume and finish what she started, not letting victimhood exclusively define her. Even though the issue concluded with Babs hanging up her togs upon successfully closing the case, I never imagined it was really the end for her as Batgirl. Little did I know that a tale replaying this near-death experience to a permanent &#8212; albeit <em>comic book</em> permanent &#8212; state had already been written, and to a much more cavalier and over-sexualized effect. With Alan Moore’s <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>, I’d lost a bit of my childhood inspiration and in the most despicable way possible &#8212; the casual maiming and sexual assault of a female hero in her civilian identity, only to serve as a backdrop for plot development. I was crushed.</p>
<p>To the supreme credit of creators John Ostrander and Kim Yale &#8212; and the heroine’s own innate inspirational status &#8212; Barbara Gordon rose again to galvanize an entirely new generation of readers. Paralyzed from the waist down after her devastating encounter with the Joker, Barbara became DC Comics’ most notable hero with a disability as Oracle, this universe’s supreme info-jock. Still putting brains ahead of brawn (although remaining incredibly well-trained in the art of physical self-defense), Barbara grew to become as spectacular a model of creativity and innovation to readers with disabilities as she had been to aspiring women and gay persons for years on end. She remained a character I loved, even if she wasn’t in the role that inspired <em>me</em> all those years ago. That she could do for others as Oracle, what she did for me as Batgirl, was special in itself. And like so many comic book characters who mean the world to her fans, Barbara had become a real person that readers could cheer for and be comforted by &#8212; which made her debut in DC Comics’ New 52 all the harder for some, but even more joyous for others, myself included.</p>

<p>All previews and advance advertising aside, opening up <em>Batgirl</em> #1 and seeing Barbara flying through the air on a line, grinning ear-to-ear as if to burst from happiness &#8212; it got me. As one of the few characters to even grace the covers of their #1 issues last September with a smile on her face, I could feel the joy radiating off the page right into my chest. I knew it was a controversial move, taking Babs out of the wheelchair and back into costume. But I couldn’t help it. I was that little kid running home from school all over again, beaming when his hero finally appeared after waiting through so many episodes where she hadn’t. That said, if all I was getting was my favorite version of Barbara Gordon back, then yes, I knew it would feel hollow later on. It’s one thing to understand that the appearance and reappearance of characters in comics is cyclical, but it is another to see such a rich character devolve back to an earlier, less interesting version of herself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this has not been the case. Writer Gail Simone, architect of much of Barbara Gordon’s last decade of appearances as Oracle in the title <em>Birds of Prey</em>, has crafted a new iteration of the character for the New 52 that is as meaningful and important as every one that came before. Her Babs is younger, fresh out of college, and one year into her recovery from the devastating encounter with the Joker that put a stop to her Batgirl career three years prior. Having undergone an experimental surgery at a South African clinic renowned for its success in mobility rehabilitation, Barbara Gordon is well on her way to being the street vigilante she once was, but not without noticeable struggle. Simone has taken great care to infuse the inner monologue of the title with clues to Barbara’s physical state of recovery, even having Batgirl remark in her head that her legs won’t stop shaking and she has to go to the bathroom something fierce (a weakened bladder being one residual effect of long term paralysis). Like many of the heroes reintroduced last September, Barbara isn’t at the top of her game yet, but the reasoning behind this lack of polish is key to <em>Batgirl</em>’s ongoing narrative.</p>

<p>Barbara Gordon here is no teenage lightweight, but a woman who has experienced a significant physical and mental trauma, and remains affected by post-traumatic stress disorder. In the first issue, when confronted by a gun pointed in precisely the same way as that of her personal attacker, Batgirl freezes &#8212; unable to proceed despite her best efforts. No matter how smart, tough or well-prepared Barbara thought she was, her mind betrays her in that moment, as it would any cop or soldier suffering from the same insidious disorder. The mind, as it turns out, rehabilitates on a different timetable than the body. What has been so elegant to watch unfold over the course of a year is, in fact, just how Babs’ mind recovers bit by bit &#8212; a rebuilding of her confidence in herself and her mission. We were not privy to witnessing Barbara’s physical recovery, and I believe we are the better for it, as this form of recuperation is far more engrossing and, ultimately, more rewarding. Mental recovery in the face of extreme trauma is something readers rarely see on the comic page, no matter how many extreme situations a hero finds him or herself faced with. To experience it here through Barbara’s eyes is a fascinating new twist on a tradition steeped in personal violence.</p>
<p>Ardian Syaf’s pencils throughout the year have been exemplary in depicting a Barbara still a little bit unsure of her own footing, both literally and metaphorically. No easy task to portray physical awkwardness with the same sophistication as acrobatic excellence, Syaf excels at maintaining a kinetic feel to the page without drowning in self-conscious turbulance. Even in her brief moments of failure, Barbara’s appearance is clean and crisp, but emotive. Particularly in scenes between Barbara and her mother &#8212; returned to seek a relationship after leaving her family nine years prior &#8212; guest penciller Alitha Martinez adeptly captures the tension between the women without resorting to caricature (and illustrates, in my opinion, some of the best hairstyles on female characters that I have ever seen). Ultimately, however, it is Batgirl’s moments of great success &#8212; in taking down an opponent physically with all she has &#8212; that shine brightest. In those moments when the adversary believes Barbara beaten, her unique ability to think out the winning move and execute it so proficiently, is profoundly satisfying &#8212; all the more knowing the difficult path it took to get there.</p>

<p>In addition to PTSD, Barbara exhibits significant signs of survivor’s guilt, the sense that one has done wrong simply by overcoming a significant trauma when others have not. Frequently experienced by those who endure and survive combat, physical disease or disastrous circumstances when others in similar circumstances do not, the guilt Barbara is experiencing is affecting her physical aptitude &#8212; once again constructing a perilous bridge for Batgirl to travel from body to mind (and back again) in recovery. In the first storyline, Barbara confronts the villain Mirror, who is motivated by the same survivor’s guilt after the death of his wife and two children in a car crash. To find and defeat Mirror, Babs has to understand her own recovery as a blessing, not a curse, that survival is neither a miracle nor a mistake. Not everything can be explained as part of a greater plan, and that’s a difficult lesson to learn for someone who has always held her own analytical skill in high regard.</p>

<p>To stand before Mirror &#8212; before any reader who has experienced and survived traumatic events &#8212; and insist that sometimes miracles just happen whether deserved or not, Babs unfolds a new layer of inspiration for yet another deserving fan-base. Like every incarnation since 1967, Simone’s Barbara Gordon represents the personal experience and aspiration of many of those who eagerly read her monthly tales, and its been a deep pleasure to see that represented online, on twitter and in convention stories, by those who have been affected by trauma and recovered &#8212; or have not, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it&#8217;s impossible for one person (or character) to be everything to everybody &#8212; to be so meaningful that fans will climb over each other to claim her as exclusively their own. Barbara Gordon is that rare person who has represented so many of life&#8217;s different struggles with honesty and humility, and every last one of them with the same commitment and sense of self-worth. We each want to own that piece of Barbara that we hold dear, but in life, as in the comics, she is her own woman &#8212; unable to be boxed into just one version of her own best self. As a character, Barbara has truly been blessed to accumulate creators and fans that feel so passionately about her. But as someone who has found inspiration in <em>Batgirl</em> and her extensive publishing history, I&#8217;m the one who feels blessed today. I have gotten to share in just one sliver of Barbara Gordon&#8217;s greatness with these words, however inadequate they may be. But knowing Babs as we do after all these years, I have a feeling she&#8217;d humbly smile and reassure me with a gentle pat on the shoulder and a few heartfelt words. That&#8217;s just the kind of person we’ve watched her grow to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melina Marchetta is an Australian writer well known for her YA novels set in Catholic high schools (the wonderful <em>Saving Francesca</em> is a frequent reread.) She also won the Printz, a high honor for YA books, for <em>Jellicoe Road</em>, a book I found so sad that I haven&#8217;t ever picked it up for a second read. But in the last decade she turned her well-tuned characterization and plotting skills to fantasy, writing <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em>, my recommendation for your summer reading.</p>
<p>It is my contention that some of the best recent high fantasy is about trauma and recovery from trauma. Novels of wars between low-tech nations and their rulers are an excellent place to think about personal and social trauma; a writer can enlarge the boundaries of traumatic events so widely that it becomes impossible to think that these events would <em>not</em> have repercussions in individual characters&#8217; lives. In realistic fiction and in our own lives it&#8217;s a lot easier to bury a hugely traumatic event and assume that a character is over it, but when the entire kingdom suffers we cannot. In fact, in <em>Finnikin</em> the movement from silence to speaking together about horrible experiences is an important narrative trajectory. I&#8217;m not saying that <em>Finnikin</em> is very dark, but it is about recovery. (Another excellent example of this is Kristin Cashore&#8217;s Graceling novels.)</p>
<p>When <em>Finnikin</em> opens we find the eponymous main character, a young man, on his usual pursuits: going through the land looking for help for his exiled people and for information about both the dead and the possibly living &#8212; could the heir survive? Ten years before, Lumatere, a small, peaceful kingdom at the confluence of trade routes, had been invaded by troops from the north. Lumaterans blamed a magic-wielding minority for their troubles and began to persecute them. In response to their cruelties, at her death at the stake the priestess Seranonna cursed Lumatere, shutting it off entirely from the rest of the world. Those who were able to flee the country were shut out, unable to contact their “lost beloveds.” An impenetrable cloud lay over Lumatere.</p>
<p>Finnikin&#8217;s self-imposed work is the keeping of the <em>Book of Lumatere</em>, recording who was lost &#8212; at the closing of Lumatere, in massacres at refugee camps, of the plague &#8212; and who stayed alive. He also has been working with the kingdom&#8217;s former head courtier to convince other countries to offer a piece of land to the exiled Lumaterans. But when they meet a young woman who says she knows where the heir might be, their plans have to change.</p>
<p>I particularly like that in this book, after what might in a more conventional novel be the ending, Marchetta makes us stay with the characters and learn how they move together toward wholeness, understanding, and &#8212; dare I say &#8212; happiness. (This paragraph made intentionally vague to avoid spoilers.)</p>
<p>The sequel, <em>Froi of the Exiles</em>, was published a number of years ago in Australia but is now available in bookstores here. I haven&#8217;t read it yet, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m recommending for my own summer reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of year where we relish in the television programming of numerous month-long horror moviethons. It’s also that time of year when children’s fears are formed by inadvertently catching a glimpse of daddy’s favorite slasher flick. We’ve all been scarred by witnessing something we shouldn’t in movies and television at a young age. It shapes us. It’s the basis for our fear of commitment… public speaking… clowns.</p>
<p>Being a child of the eighties I inevitably share in the list of unavoidable traumatic experiences: the entirety of the <em>Thriller</em> music video, Large Marge from <em>Pee Wee’s Big Adventure</em>, the creepy-ass ferry ride in <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> (it’s the worm! it’s the chickenhead!) Despite the across-the-board scares, every kid has been traumatized by a number of unique moments in film that have shaped who they’ve become. These, my friends, are candidly mine:</p>
<p><strong>#10. The Sentinel (1977)</strong></p>
<p>In this bizarrely entertaining supernatural horror flick, a young model finds a new apartment in New York City. Little does she know it not only houses her, but the gateway to Hell. This film is filled with a plethora of truly strange moments, but the scene that firmly left a terrifying impression finds the woman awoken in the middle of the night by strange sounds in her apartment. As she investigates an empty room, a demonic figure materializes behind a door and power walks across the room without acknowledging her. That alone gave me horrific paranoia that something would materialize at the foot of my bed and walk out of the room. I’m just happy I didn’t see the remainder of the scene as a child where she stabs the corpse repeatedly and chops off its nose – blech!</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vRG4dxQBYCo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#09. Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988)</strong></p>
<p>“What’re ya gonna do, knock my block off?”</p>
<p>The famous last words of the street tough that breaks the little Klown’s bike have seared their way into my childhood memories. Shown on as a Saturday afternoon flick on some random local channel, my cousin and I found the concept of wacky Killer Klowns irresistible. However, when this scene showed I quickly lost my bravery and spent the rest of the movie staring at the back of a couch pillow. It’s all fun and games until someone loses a head.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZAWOxxKFsiI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#08. Dr. Giggles (1992)</strong></p>
<p>As children, sleepovers often tend to manifest as odd games of chicken. Your friend has scored a copy of some R-rated film you aren’t supposed to see, and it becomes a game to see who freaks out first. For me, it was <em>Dr. Giggles</em>, and I lost. Big time. As a woman struggles for life, she calls for a doctor. Dr. Giggles arrives on the scene to inspect the problem… The poor woman is already in an immense amount of pain when the doctor pulls out an instrument to peek up her nose: a spike that stabs through to her brain. I can’t quite say the extent that this scene had on me, despite its cheesiness, but It’s still been over a decade since my last check-up.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCelqPbhs7A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#07. The Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)</strong></p>
<p>This film is the epitome of what children shouldn’t see. The opening scene is scary enough&mdash;Dan Aykroyd scared the hell out of me as a kid (he still does, but now it’s for more creepy-old-man-holding-onto-the-past reasons), but that’s far from what kept me (and subsequently my parents) up for night after night. Joe Dante’s segment involving a kid who can manipulate his surroundings to suit his every whim seemed fun enough… but it’s the reveal of his sister who is forced to endlessly watch cartoons that ripped my stomach to shreds. Those strained eyes! That mouthless face!!! I’ve never been the same. Even <em>The Matrix</em> brought back terrified feelings.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvUJBcuLl6U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#06.  Hellraiser (1988)</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting scare for me as it’s not even a scene from the film, but one single image of a man without skin lounging around an apartment. I haven’t seen this film, but I caught this horrific image while staying the night in a family friend’s house for the first time. The unfamiliar setting mixed with such unnatural and gross imagery made for an utterly unpleasant night. If memory serves me right, I forced my parents to leave in the middle of the night and get a hotel. But then, I was only six, so I doubt I had that sort of power over my parents.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Hellraiser" src="https://i0.wp.com/paperweb.me/images/uploads/288.jpeg" alt="" width="666" height="373" /></p>
<p><strong>#05. The Wizard of Oz (1939)</strong></p>
<p>I think from birth until around five years old this was my favorite movie. But then as my fragile little brain developed &#8220;comprehension&#8221; and I began to understand the concepts of &#8220;intention&#8221; and &#8220;consequences.&#8221; The Wicked Witch sending her evil monkeys to attack Dorothy and her friends was enough to send me into fits of rage as a child. Specifically the shot of the Scarecrow getting torn apart was too much for my delicate little mind. To this day I refuse to watch <em>Johnny Got His Gun</em>, and I blame it on the thought of the Scarecrow’s torso crawling around.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SESI19h4wDo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#04. Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988)</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure what traumatized me more, seeing Christopher Lloyd’s terrifying transformation at the end of this film or finding out that the insane maniac Judge Doom was also Doc Brown! This was a double whammy for me. After his psychotic outbreak at the end of <em>Roger Rabbit</em>, (particularly the unbearable squealing as he was run over by a steamroller,) I wasn’t able to watch <em>Back to the Future</em> for years. The sight of Doc Brown scared me as at any second I expected red devil cartoon eyes to appear. And don’t even get me started on <em>Angels in the Outfield</em>.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADrojCw6amM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#03. The Exorcist (1973)</strong></p>
<p>I realize that this is rather a cliché choice, but after seeing <em>The Exorcist</em>, I was unable to even close my eyes for fear that I would see that demonic face&mdash;not the grotesque make-up effects on poor Reagan, but the chilling ghostly face that appears throughout the film. I saw this film at <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">eighteen-years-old</span> too young an age to deal with the idea of a demon consuming my mind and body. I had to fall asleep to <em><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Three’s Company</span></em> Looney Tunes for at least a week afterwards.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" title="The Exorcist/Captain Howdy" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/captain_howdy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/captain_howdy.jpg?w=300"></a>#02. Fire in the Sky (1993)</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time on a lovely Saturday afternoon HBO changed my life forever. Unaware that a twelve-year-old <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">boy</span> baby might be watching the film, they decided to program <em>Fire in the Sky</em>. The twelve-minute abduction sequence is by far one of the most traumatizing scenes I’ve ever endured. The fear of those Don Rickles lookin’ aliens has never left me. Searching for the following clip was torture, even at nearly thirty-years-old:</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrQLqFfelic?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#01. Robocop (1987)</strong></p>
<p>While <em>Fire in the Sky</em> is certainly the strongest and most lingering traumatizing film from my childhood, the number one spot goes to the earliest memory I have that set the stage for all fears of film to come. First let me say, this is no film for a child to watch&mdash;it makes me nauseous even today. In a way I was lucky that the only part I witnessed was this scene near the beginning of the film where the evil ED-209 prototype is being demonstrated for a number of investors. “I’m sure it’s only a glitch,” he says… the sheer lack of humanity and the amount of gore those bullets produce was entirely and completely mortifying.  I blame this film for my later fear of war movies. It wasn’t the Nazis that made me afraid of <em>Schindler’s List</em>, it was Robocop!<em> </em></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrXfh4hENKs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>So there it is. The late eighties were a rough time for me, but every fear helped shape who I am. For the most part I’ve gone back and conquered most of these films. These days there aren’t many films that linger with me, but I always enjoy the few that do. I don’t mind losing a little sleep if it reminds me that I’m still alive! Hopefully none of you use this revealing information to torture me in the future&mdash;but at least I didn’t reveal my fear of <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Harpo_Marx.jpg">Harpo Marx</a>. Shit!</p>
