										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a previous column I wrote about Elvis Costello’s very interesting show on Sundance, <em>Spectacle with Elvis Costello</em>. Talk, music, and special guests, the show offers much for many. I remember the first time I heard about Elvis Costello. It was in an X-Men comic when the Beast visited an old ex from his college days. She had gone &#8220;new wave&#8221; and mentioned Elvis Costello. The next time was when Rykodisc released <em>The Very Best of Elvis Costello and the Attractions</em> collection in 1994. I had been working at Wherehouse records for a few months by that point and I remember my manager looking for something play in the store. I suggested the Elvis. I heard it and while I cannot remember the actual timeline, I fell in love with the music (and with the concept of Jenny Brenner’s daughter, a customer who was replacing her tapes one by one on CD&mdash;I met her once but she had great taste) and would go on to own all the Elvis CDs on Rykodisc. </p>

In my journey back when I was young I tracked down the 7” for &#8220;I Can’t Stand Up (For Falling Down)&#8221; and the B-side, which always warms my heart, &#8220;Girls Talk.&#8221; My YouTube trip started with Elvis, then I started thinking about Nick Lowe. I watched a few videos from the Live Stiff Tour, then I started thinking about Rockpile, so I watched some clips from Rockpalast and other gigs. Rockpile got me thinking about Dave Edmunds and so I watched his version of the song &#8220;Girls Talk.&#8221; Costello wrote the song, gave it to Edmunds (the story goes) who released his version the year before it appeared on the 7”. Somewhere in there, Linda Rondstadt also recorded and released the song. I enjoyed the journey, linear though it may have been, but as I relistened to the song it really got me thinking. One line in particular: </p>
<p>“I’ve got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk.”</p>
<p>My God.<br />
<em>Oh I want to hear girls talk</em><br />
That line.<br />
<em>Oh I want to hear girls talk</em><br />
Sums up everything.</p>
<p>What do we want when we listen to music? For years, YEARS, I just wanted to hear girls talk. I bought records based on what girls in the store would buy just in case, in the off chance that I summoned up any guts, any gumption, that if they entered my apartment we would have something more to find common ground on. Music is molecular, and it is about a series of moments, of associations you are changed when you first hear a song, one that really touches you, seeps into your brain and your DNA. You are never the same and yet you are chasing that feeling from that point onwards. It is about the moment, that initial rush. Like the first buzz you get from your first cigarette, the feeling of the first kiss, the first lay, the first drink. It is the feeling that you have once that disappears, only to remain in your brain for the rest of your days. These are the things that haunt you, the way a great line in a great song can do. It can haunt you because it is so true; it is so pure and so insightful. Maybe not to everyone, but to you. You can have many ladies in your life, but that feeling of that purity, that innocence, that wonder is gone and you yearn for it. Those feelings, that thrill. It never really goes away, but it really never comes back. . . <em>Oh I want to hear girls talk.</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[I don’t like Bruce Springsteen. Let me rephrase that: I don’t like the music of Bruce Springsteen. Let me revise that revision: I don’t like the music of the E Street Band. I love <em>Nebraska</em>. I love and have many fine memories of <em>The Ghost Of Tom Joad</em> (and the live bootlegs we would carry and listen to at Wherehouse Records in East Lansing). I don’t care for the big, overblown sound of the E Street band, the honking of Clarence Clemons, the keyboards, and the whole shebang. Much of this I owe to being 10 at the time of <em>Born in The USA</em> and having that music saturate the airwaves of my youth. I didn’t like it then and it just doesn’t do it for me now.

Years later when I heard the REAL version of &#8220;Born in the USA&#8221; (it was meant for <em>Nebraska</em>) I found I could appreciate it and really re-discover the song. 	</p>

You see, I think Bruce Springsteen is really cool. When I read his lyrics, stripped of the sounds I don’t care for, I really respect his vision and what he is working to capture in his songs. I wish he would retire all those old songs, “Born to Run” in particular, or limit his audience to the current crop of people who are affected by today’s economy and crises. A friend told me about a Springsteen concert after he started touring again with the E Street Band full of 45-year-old men pumping their fists in the air and singing along. I expect it to be worse now, with people sticking their iPhones in the air to “capture the moment forever.” It has become pap, a commodity, a way to re-live a time when you were young, angry, passionate, and working towards something rather than paying 400 bucks for tickets, 40 bucks for a shirt, 40 bucks for gas, and 60 bucks for the nanny for the kids. I don’t fault Springsteen, but a maturing audience and a maturing artist will only diverge as time goes forward.</p>
<p>The last time I accidentally bumped into Springsteen on the tube, he was a guest on Elvis Costello’s incredibly addictive program <em>Spectacle</em>. I wish there was no live audience on the show, as every time they pan out to the star-struck and mewling faces I get a grouchy feeling. On one episode I saw Malcolm Gladwell and Steve Buscemi in the crowd, and something about that tandem distracted me. On the Springsteen episode, Elvis talked with Bruce and Springsteen said something that made me really like him about ten times more. He quoted a Costello song.  Not “Alison,” not “Watching the Detectives,” nothing that anyone would know, but “Green Shirt,” from <em>Armed Forces</em>, and its line, “Who put these fingerprints on my imagination?” Then he donned a dinner jacket and sang Sam &amp; Dave songs with Costello. At that moment, in my mid-thirties, I finally felt a connection to Springsteen. Coupled with a YouTube video I found of Springsteen singing “Keep The Car Running” with Arcade Fire, my level of respect grew. Springsteen is a music fan. Sure, he’s in the business, but he is a fan. And when he used that Costello line, he made me realize that he is a part of the club too. And somehow that took the sting and bile out of thinking about all those people with their cellphones. They’re all fans, they’re all a part of something bigger, and in that moment they’re happy. And there is really nothing wrong about that.</p>
