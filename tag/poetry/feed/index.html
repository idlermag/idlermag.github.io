										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t know grief until you experience grief.  Its pain is ineffable. It socks your body and mind and ruins all sense of reason, meaning. Anything you’ve believed or held true becomes subject to question when someone you care for passes away because something impossibly ridiculous has happened &#8212; a living breathing someone gives up the spark of life and enters a world of objects. Voice, heart, soul, mind, touch. . . all removed from personhood.  Unmagicked into a thing, a someone becomes corpse, becomes ash, becomes not. As death and grief are universals that rip at the fabric of human understanding, of course this subject matter has inspired much in the way of the arts. Though I’ve been moved by many a film and story, I reserve this space to discuss a text that maybe you won’t happen upon on the bestsellers case at your bookstore, or hear about from a friend. Anne Carson’s book/assemblage <em>Nox</em> (2010) has affected me deeply as it so closely and strangely performs and researches the reaches of grief through its remarkable structure, art, truth and tone.  This odd text is worth seeking, finding, discovering and revisiting again and again.</p>
<p>Carson lost her brother twice. A kind of shade in life, he lived apart from his family. Estranged for long periods of time, he kept little contact with his sister. He’d pass along snippets of information by post &#8212; his envelopes acting as clues to his whereabouts overseas. He was a brother, blood, but he existed and didn’t.  His death gave his absence a new permanence and the author was left with the odd practice of learning to grieve for a shade &#8212; giving up he who was already a ghost.  <em>Nox</em> could be interpreted as her attempt of reconfiguring him, erecting a monument, seeking her brother, seeking peace. In making her piece, Carson creates a solid, material presence in the face of loss. It commemorates, elegizes, and yearns for him. Both heartrending and comforting, the text exposes her wounds, but also creates a space for commiseration through the making-public, the opening out of her pain to a world of others floating in the same limbo of emotions.</p>

<p>Paradoxically apt then, <em>Nox</em> is a book that is not one.  A grey hardcover case, something like a pencil or cigar box, houses one long folded sheet, an accordion of pictures, pasted-in letters, hand-scribbled and typewritten text. This unexpected book-form embodies a different kind of connectivity between the reader and what is written. With its layered folds the construction of the accordion suggests a different relationship between story and its experienced temporality. Before we’ve even read the first line, Carson forces us to sensually read and feel the text, to understand with fingers and eyes &#8212; we read without words.  We must open the box, find its secret. Lift the heft of the zigzagging page, careful not to spill it.  We do not merely start reading, but are offered an encounter. Photocopied pages from books and articles, well-worn and folded notes, dog-eared photographs and the visual echoes of writing (a pencil pressed into a page too hard) all lend themselves to the creation of authenticity, the personal, while also expressing the lack that inevitably surrounds these traces—these things only lead back, but do not (re)capture.</p>
<p>An academic and poet, Carson leans on poetry, history, and etymology to answer her questions and fill grief’s emptiness.  Her questions range from the intimately personal (Who was my brother? To me?) to the generalizable or philosophical (How have people written of loss historically? How do the words and practices of the past shape who we are? How we grieve and how we feel?).  She covers the gamut examining historical texts from the ancient Greeks to historical texts from her family’s archive.  Placing these works side by side suggests their similarity as practices of collection, keeping, and knowing, that ultimately cannot offer <em>enough</em> truth or consolation in the face of a death’s void.  Carson records her brother’s life (or more his death?) like a history or legend.  She makes it akin to her precious academic artifacts perhaps hoping to rub more epic meaning on the ordinariness of her loss. Or, perhaps in this move, she stresses the power of context &#8212; the intimate experiences of “my life” are felt as mythic in proportion. She then invites us into this scrapbook of her personal tragedy &#8212; asks us to place it beside Oedipus and Antigone, Romeo, Hamlet.</p>
<p>Carson reminds us that our lives &#8212; even as we live them daily, solidly, in what we deem “reality” &#8212; are made up of things that are only close to us, or pretend to be us. We compose ourselves through the stories we remember, the stories we choose to tell and not tell, archives we endorse or simply leave behind.  Carson tries to re-member her brother through or as an object &#8212; the writing, the book.  He is brought together in pieces like Osiris, reformed, but the product is never satisfactory. Always product, never brother. A collection of scraps and fragments, this text, and perhaps all our histories, form poetic statements that yearn for context, detail and connection, but they also stand alone as particularly resonant poetic moments of open-endedness &#8212; fragments that can only create the feelings/meanings they create because of their inherent disconnection.</p>
<p>I can’t say that writing/building/making this text was a salve of some kind to its maker. I don’t know if it brought relief or consolation or even if consolation is at all ever possible. I can say however that the reading and experiencing of Carson’s <em>Nox</em> is the closest thing I’ve found to someone saying “I know how you feel. I’ve been there. I am there,” while also being the closest I’ve felt to actually believing that statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was taking my nerdiness to a whole new level on poetryfoundation.org. A friend had tipped me off to a series the site ran a few years ago called <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2011/04/poem-as-comic-strip-redux/" target="_blank">“The Poem as Comic Strip.”</a> The project asks some of the most respected and celebrated comic artists of today to interpret any poem in the Poetry Foundation&#8217;s archives from “<em>Beowulf</em> to present.” This collaboration allows for the artists and readers to explore the intersection of graphic and verse. While comics and poems might seem as unlikely bedfellows as <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/179402" target="_blank">Gabriel Bell</a> and <a href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/blog/uploaded_images/dickinson.jpg" target="_blank">Emily Dickinson</a>, the two have a few things in common. For one, both poems and comics are known for their use of space, especially white space, on the page. Combine this with the careful pacing necessary to both mediums and you have a sound combination&mdash;one worth further exploration.</p>
<p>There’s even a strip that uses a poem by the poet-in-residence at my alma mater: <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/179224" target="_blank">Diane<br />
Wakoski</a>.</p>
<p>The foundation seems to have removed the complete strips from the site, but Google Images pulls up some <a href="http://26.media.tumblr.com/WXCapTL7Fcktyik9S2bkbYPA_500.gif" target="_blank">interesting results</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>FOR TIM</strong><br />
suggesting I name ten things I truly believe, which is really fucking impossible</p>
<p>I believe in Bobby Higginson</p>
<p>the working class hero<br />
my father who rises every morning<br />
before it is morning<br />
to hurl watt after watt like lightning bolts<br />
from the open blisters of his palms.</p>
<p>I believe in being five<br />
my father teaching me to throw<br />
in the backyard/ our house on Crescent Avenue:<br />
sidearm<br />
hard<br />
almost no arc on the ball<br />
watched it tail</p>
<p>as a ten inch comet<br />
to my father’s open mitt.</p>
<p>I believe in drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon<br />
between innings<br />
bruise like a lunar eclipse on one thigh<br />
being knocked unconscious<br />
waking with the ball still in my glove.</p>
<p>I believe in protecting the plate.</p>
<p>I believe in falling in love<br />
with baseball players:<br />
the way a man’s quadriceps change<br />
when he is crouched behind the plate<br />
the certain perfection of a<br />
fundamentally sound swing</p>
<p>the feathery gradations infield dirt makes<br />
on home jerseys;</p>
<p>I believe in the legends, the way my father<br />
has always seemed like Roger Maris to me<br />
all quiet statements and no eye contact<br />
cement dust creasing into his elbows<br />
a whole universe of power in those forearms</p>
<p>Joel Zumaya&#8217;s arms,<br />
the flame tattoos engulfing them as red giants</p>
<p>the one gold moon<br />
encircling my father&#8217;s ring finger</p>
<p>resting on his chest<br />
when he falls asleep on the couch<br />
covering the logo on his shirt:</p>
<p>Omega.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&#8217;s time. Pitchers and catchers have reported to Lakeland. I saw five birds on my run yesterday. The snow is melting. We&#8217;re (allegedly) going to have an early spring.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a day after Valentine&#8217;s, and all I can think about is how much I love the Tigers.</em></p>
<p><strong>LOVE LETTER POSTMARKED MICHIGAN AND TRUMBALL</strong></p>
<p>It’s the legs I fall in love with,<br />
the high knee socks and pants stopping<br />
just at the crest of calf<br />
small bay of knee.</p>
<p>They’re Brandon Inge’s legs<br />
sublime and twitchy at third base</p>
<p>the shudder in Abuelito’s walk<br />
the limp when he shuffled into the Loma<br />
with a mistress at his hip</p>
<p>wondering how I’d have been so surprised<br />
when the man I love with the knees<br />
made of glass<br />
betrayed me.</p>
<p>I must have fallen in love with<br />
Abuelito first, then Lance Parrish,<br />
and now these Tigers</p>
<p>the way every woman in my family<br />
has learned to love any man</p>
<p>stumbling over the positives<br />
(“we were in almost every game”)</p>
<p>waiting for next year<br />
it could always be so much worse<br />
as a friend says, “we could all have one leg.”</p>
<p>Oh, Abuelito, teaching me<br />
to love the lost men before I knew<br />
he was among them</p>
<p>to love them even more the further they went away<br />
when one could only listen through the radio<br />
in the driveway of the old house on Fairmont<br />
Ernie Harwell forever notching the scores</p>
<p>his lovely wife Lulu eternally waiting at home<br />
with dinner still warm</p>
<p>losses stepping upon losses</p>
<p>like the bricks of the new ballpark.</p>
<p>How I waited for them for years<br />
and they couldn’t even<br />
set the record<br />
for most losses in one season</p>
<p>because that, in its own way, would be<br />
a kind of win.</p>
<p>But it’s smaller&mdash;the man at the plate<br />
when every out is a war<br />
and every strike a reason to leave<br />
and every pitch, my love, is a weak ankle<br />
shattering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cardinal Dreams</strong></p>
<p>1.<br />
Firebird, Thunderbird, Sunbird<br />
they all seemed the same to me<br />
their headlights like eyes<br />
unmoving, blank.  </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Phoenix Center in downtown Pontiac,<br />
somewhere near the Fiero plant and Fischer Body<br />
where Johnny Cash worked three weeks<br />
alongside Abuelito, building the 1951 models. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Johnny Cash joining the Air Force, Abuelito’s<br />
old Aztec thunderbird medallion curling<br />
into his chest hair<br />
those years after the war,<br />
open shirt, asleep on the couch<br />
with the afternoon game on, his mammoth<br />
cherries jubilee Cadillac parked in the driveway, </p>
<p>4.<br />
four years old when he jumps off<br />
the couch and the Tigers take the World Series,<br />
tugging at his pant leg<br />
and repeating what I think is the name<br />
of his automobile </p>
<p>5.<br />
car-din-al. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Once I dreamed a cardinal:<br />
on a power line<br />
bisecting a dying oak<br />
in the front yard of the home<br />
I was leaving</p>
<p>Sean Casey’s calf muscle snapping<br />
as a taut electrical wire in Game Two</p>
<p>my Abuelita when she discovered<br />
the crimson lipstick of her husband’s mistress. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Like a skipping record for days, for weeks<br />
I look out the front window<br />
of the house on Allen St.<br />
three perfectly equal wooden frames<br />
stained dark a hundred years before<br />
spinning tires.</p>
<p>8.<br />
Through the wood<br />
of the frames/ through the glass and the branches<br />
of the three story oak to the transmission lines<br />
on the other side – it is the same every time. </p>
<p>One cardinal</p>
<p>motionless</p>
<p>balanced on a wire. </p>
<p>9.<br />
In the dream is it clear, the facts are unquestionable:<br />
I’ve seen this same bird,<br />
	fixing its tiny<br />
	repeating record eyes on me until I wake,<br />
hundreds of times/</p>
<p>I cannot remember<br />
if I’ve seen the bird/<br />
awake. </p>
<p>10.<br />
It’s the baseball day-<br />
dreams, the two hands of Albert Pujols,<br />
the St. Louis Cardinal </p>
<p>smiling across his jersey, his hands still<br />
as the pitcher begins his motion,<br />
the sublime strain of fabric<br />
along quadriceps.</p>
<p>He’s a man you love even when he breaks you<br />
when the Cardinals take the Series in five<br />
and we go home alone.</p>
<p>12.<br />
The cherries and the cars and the<br />
bird and the tugging were all the same, were all real<br />
or not real, were all some kind of way </p>
<p>to explain what had happened/ what had maybe<br />
never happened, but I cannot speak<br />
when I try to say it, lusting after Pujols </p>
<p>and alone at night and wearing patent red<br />
shoes, imagining myself as Mercury<br />
with the winged heels when I chase the bus,<br />
waving a hand looking into each passing branch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[First Joel Zumaya’s beautiful right elbow went supernova, a truly sickening thing to watch in real time, as I did, tearing up because I just want to hug the boy and tell him, it’s ok, son, you’ve got one more brutal recovery and storybook comeback in you. 

Then in rapid succession: Brandon Inge (fractured hand) Magglio Ordonez (broken ankle) and Carlos Guillen (calf strain) fall like dominos, as though they were all single file on the third base line, just waiting their turn.

Which brings us to now. Take a look at <a target="new" href="http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/boxscore?gameId=300829114">Sunday’s starting lineup</a> for the Bless You Boys:

A Jackson CF
W Rhymes 2B
R Raburn LF
M Cabrera 1B
J Peralta SS
B Inge 3B
B Boesch DH
C Wells RF
A Avila C

It’s Miggy and the minors!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A funny thing happened to the Detroit Tigers after the All-Star break – something that seems to happen to some degree every year around this time, as <a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/joshlandon/status/19788124516">@joshlandon</a> noted, though I am not certain it involves Jim Leyland taking the boys to Tijuana for hookers and coke.</p>
<p>After making most of the American League Central look confused, outplayed and sometimes embarrassingly outclassed the first half of the season, the Tigers can’t buy a win. At least this time there’s a pretty obvious culprit: the dreaded injury bug.</p>

Johnny Damon’s been scratched more than a handful of the last few games (flu) (back) and in the meantime, our pitching staff has had a difficult time staying in the majors, with Rick Porcello and Armando Galaragga each taking their turns in the minors. </p>

<p>It’s Miggy and the minors! (Note: I didn’t come up with that on my own – some Facebook friend or another said the team looked like Miggy and the Minors, and since then, I haven’t been able to get the notion of Miguel Cabrera as the “Charles in Charge” lead of a team of baby-faced baseball players – surely a Friday night sitcom. )</p>
<p>The infield especially – in the past few days before the Peralta trade, the infield was actually Miguel + Ramon (who, let’s be honest, only this year played his way into the position, so he may as well be a rookie). Don Kelly – the 30 year old rookie – was even taking a few turns at third.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s slim pickings, but the fact that our boys in blue are even scoring or not looking like those teams we annihilated earlier in the season is in itself remarkable, and a fabulous endorsement of the minor league system we’ve got working. And, as you’ll no doubt learn over the coming months, gentle reader, I am especially grateful for the opportunity to see names in the lineup that riff easily into nicknames – such as Will “Busta” Rhymes, holding it down at second and holy hell, is the kid fast, by the by.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the admirable performance of the “and the Minors” that’s keeping this team together. Let’s turn to Yeats. <a target="new" href="http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html">The opening stanza of “The Second Coming:”</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br />
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br />
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br />
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</p></blockquote>
<p>Disclosure: my relationship with baseball borders on the ecstatic/religious, so you’ll immediately note why I am thinking of Yeats when I say this: that the truly noteworthy aspect of this season is that, for the Tigers, the center IS holding, and the center has a name and wields a terrible bat: Miguel Cabrera. </p>

He still, nearly singlehandedly on some nights, has kept the Tigers’ season on life support. The savior comparison is obvious and insulting, so I’ll let you fill in the blanks on that one.</p>
<p>But it’s not just a poetry-meets-humor-meets-baseball-and-Jesus post, folks. It’s the airtight case for Cabrera as MVP, regardless of whether he rocks the Triple Crown this year or not. The man has saved more games than Valverde can legitimately lay claim to, and he doesn’t have an off night. </p>
<p>First game back after his new baby was born? Three homers. In. One. Game. (The Tigers did lose the game – a rare night when the boys wasted Miggy’s rare talent.)</p>
<p>Sure, Robinson Cano is having a great year, too, but people, I think I could have a great year too if my teammates were the Yankees. </p>
<p>Maybe Yeats makes the best case for Cabrera, MVP:</p>
<blockquote><p>Surely some revelation is at hand;<br />
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br />
The Second Coming! …<br />
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br />
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br />
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br />
Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br />
The darkness drops again but now I know<br />
That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br />
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br />
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br />
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p></blockquote>
