										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written before about <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/14/treat-yoself-to-parks-and-rec/">how much I love <em>Parks and Recreation</em></a> &#8212; the characters, the writing &#8212; but I haven’t been too happy with this season’s trajectory. Though I am pleased with the progression of Chris Traeger’s character and the manner in which his obsessive traits have been seriously examined, the current portrayal of Leslie Knope feels both incredibly off and off-putting. The shift in Chris was unexpected. The writers could easily have kept milking his trademark perfectionism without question &#8212; his extreme fitness and nutrition practices acting merely as reminders that Chris is “that guy,” a strange, yet colorful, weirdo in this merry band of weirdos. But, instead Parks opted for depth. Lately, we’ve seen Chris’ fears laid bare and more overtly witnessed his “quirks” explained as excessive and possibly even disordered behavior. This choice is pretty brave and refreshing &#8212; to show a man who seems perfect, if grossly on top of things, and unpack that perfection as an unhealthy desire for control manifested through unhealthy treatment of his body. Pretty progressive and neat. Parks is usually pretty thoughtful like that. </p>
<p>But then there’s this issue with Leslie. Ever since Leslie got engaged to geeky pocket cutie Ben, things have been weird, y’all. The wedding, per sitcom norm, has taken up a lot of story time and space. On one level that makes me sad because it’s so cliché. Weddings, babies, the addition of a dog, or a cousin Oliver, all seem to mark the death of a show as we once knew it. There’s a sense that when these narratives pop up that maybe the show has run out of steam. I know that in terms of storytelling, this situation can be more complex. Perhaps romances, babies, dogs, and long lost cousins are parts of important stories and that’s why we see them cycled through so often on the television, but I for one, think that there also must be so much more unexplored TV territory and I was hoping my favorite show would go there, courageously and hilariously. </p>
<p>Personally, I’m not all that interested in Ben and Leslie’s romance. I like Ben. I’m glad she found a cool guy, but I’m definitely not gushing over their nuptials. The latest episodes have been particularly uncomfortable to me because they show Leslie barely capable of containing her love for Ben. We learn that getting married to her cute-butted, elflike lover is her dream come true. Spoiler alert, the couple even ties the knot 3 months early because she just can’t wait any longer to be his wife. Um, what? Again, I’m glad that Leslie’s in love or whatever, but when has marriage ever been a top priority for Ms. Knope? The Leslie I know has always wanted to be a strong, fair, and caring woman, an important politician who works for the people of her beloved town, if not the entire nation. Leslie’s dream come true, to me, would look something like President Knope (and maybe first gentleman Joe Biden) raising mini horses on the White House lawn. The Biden husband would be a nice extra, but the presidency and the mini horses would be a must. </p>
<p>So for Parks to get all sweet and saccharine on me, celebrating wuv, twoo wuv, and beyond that painting Leslie as so intensely eager for a typical marital union, without considering the political ramifications of what that union might mean. . . well, it’s a little shocking and disappointing. I know it’s not like we found out that Leslie is a serial killer or she secretly hates puppies, but this move just doesn’t match the tone or consistency of the show and character that I love.</p>
<p>Will marriage end up being more of a struggle now that the fun, pretty, and sugar-coated part is over? (The bachelor party episode did indeed remind us that almost every male character is divorced, after all). Will the old Leslie’s passion for politics return as though no sitcom narrative cliché ever occured? Or will this strange feminist show I love jump the Pawnee shark (raccoon?) and become a more typical network show? Time will tell, I guess.</p>
<p>Instead of titillating my inner romantic, Leslie and Ben making it official has left me mourning stories where it’s okay for women to want different things, want more, want something beyond or outside marriage. I’m left wishing the Hillary Clinton of the hilarious memes could send my gal Leslie a text, cuz, Giiiirrrrl, something’s up with your game. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know Nick Offerman as the straightforward, bacon-eating, curmudgeon, Ron Swanson, of NBC’s <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. He’s made quite a name for himself there playing the role of a strictly anti-government parks worker to deadpan perfection. Reaching the heights of pop cultural iconography, his Swansonisms sprawl across the internets and he’s won the masses over with his affectless stoicism, the charm of one eyebrow raised ever so slightly. But like his lovely wife before him, Megan Mullally, who played the fantabulously drevil (drunk and evil) Karen Walker on <em>Will and Grace</em>, it’s become easy to equate the actor with their most famous role. Though Swanson and Offerman do share a lot in common (meat hankerings, saxophone playing, finely groomed mustaches) there are many faces to Offerman that you may not have seen yet. </p>
<p>Having read a number of Offerman interviews and articles, I knew that he was a legit farm boy who then studied stage acting and excelled not only at his theatrical craft, but also in the crafting of sets and costumes. Though he has lots of Hollywood experience, he also feels at home performing Kabuki theater and abstract postmodernist plays. He makes silly music videos with his wife and runs a serious carpentry business where he builds beautiful furniture and seaworthy canoes. Quite a talented grab bag, this fella. That being said, I wasn’t exactly sure what I’d signed up for by purchasing a ticket to <em>American Ham</em>, Offerman’s one-man show. </p>
<p>Well, last Friday night I plopped myself down in my folding chair in the Royal Oak theater &#8212; close enough to be giddy, far away enough that I couldn’t easily storm the stage (you’re welcome, Nick). No opening act, no announcer, no muss no fuss, Nick Offerman sauntered on stage with that trademarked direct stare and downturned grumpy cat mouth. Shirtless, wearing jeans and a guitar strapped to his bod, he made his way to the mic, offered a brisk hello and promptly put on a denim stars and stripes shirt. Our semi-nudity for the night complete, he got down to business. </p>
<p>The next couple hours consisted of spoken word and sometimes musical didacticism &#8212; a fine marriage of honesty, humor, and personal philosophy. Like the traveling Chatauqua shows of the early 21st century, his show is a kind of educational entertainment for adults. Though he begins by espousing Biblical teachings the ilk of “Do unto others,” he also heartily deconstructs “The Good Book” claiming that <em>The Hobbit</em> is also a good book that is far more consistent. (Offerman knows a lot about elves and wizards and things &#8212; a fun nerd surprise). He unpacks the importance of engaging in romantic love, no matter what your sexual preference, and exposes the ridiculous sexism of the Bible’s male writers who helped solidify a culture of woman fear and woman hating. I liked this part a lot. Any man who reminds his peers that menstruation is not disgusting or unclean gets a high-five from this gal. Beyond this, he discusses the value of “please and thank you,” the power of hard work, and good drugs (used responsibly, of course). He urged us be in nature, avoid the pitfalls of the mirror (our flaws are not as awful as advertisers claim), and he strongly suggested that we pick up a hobby, develop a discipline, find passion for a craft and the honing of it. Oh, and always carry a handkerchief to wipe a sweaty brow, politely blow one’s nose, or apply a tourniquet to a bleeding neighbor’s flesh wound. </p>
<p>Offerman is clearly a man who delights in words, multisyllable ones and curse words alike. He takes pleasure in speaking slowly and picking the appropriate term for the situation, likes the feel of a complex notion taking shape on his tongue. But perhaps best of all, his calm, measured lecturing is easily broken by a mischievous giggle that bubbles up out from under his mustache at odd intervals. The crowd could not help but burst into laughter in response every time. </p>
<p>Was there some Ron Swanson in there? Definitely, but not too much. <em>American Ham</em> was very much about balance. It showed me that Nick Offerman has delighted in being both a stalwart American man &#8212; a quiet, tree-hewing, meat-grilling sort, but also the gentle idiot, the ham who plays and wants to be seen playing, the kind of man who hand-makes cards for his “sweet stack of curves” wife along with the dorkiest loving song about how hard he’s gonna do her. Likewise, though his show takes us back in time to a simpler, plainer form of entertainment, it is good and hearty fare. See the show, go outside, make a craft. Those Ron Swanson gifs will still be there when you get back, and if Offerman is right, they’ll be all the sweeter once you’ve earned them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Awaiting <em>Mad Men</em>’s return and having missed the boat on <em>Downton Abbey</em> (I’ll get there, don’t worry), I’m left in a bit of the television doldrums at the moment.  Though I’m enjoying the zombies of <em>The Walking Dead</em> gnawing on delicious face meat once a week, I can’t honestly say it’s my favorite thing to watch on the tube.  The husband is putting a dent in <em>Supernatural</em> on Netflix and while I watch with him, that show’s a little too dudemeistery for me &#8212; muscle cars, classic rock, bedding hot ghoulie gals.  The show I look forward to without fail and the show that likewise never leaves me hanging in this, my time of need, is <em>Parks and Recreation</em>.</p>
<p>When it first aired on NBC in 2009, I really wanted to like it.  I’m a staunch supporter of Amy Poehler &#8212; STAUNCH! But mostly I felt let down.  It seemed like NBC was trying to suck the lifeblood from the cash cow that is <em>The Office</em> by creating a dismally similar show, uncomfortable documentary camera eye and all.</p>
<p><strong>NBC exec:</strong> What else is boring like an office? Oooh, I know, a government office!  Ka-ching!</p>
<p>*Dollar sign eyeballs.*</p>
<p>&#8211;End Scene.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found the plot kind of boring.  And the eccentricities of the characters seemed a stretch with little payoff.  Poehler as Leslie Knope played a pretty believable straight-A perfectionist go-getter in overdrive, but the storylines surrounding the Parks and Rec workers read flimsy, a little weak.  That first season revolved around Leslie’s dream of filling an eyesore of a pit to better her beloved town of Pawnee and to me, <em>Parks</em> was metaphorically quite similar: a niceish show with a big ugly hole in it.  Dutifully, I tried to watch it, but it ended up disappearing into the ether and other, shinier, pop culture tidbits captured my attention instead (I think I watched <em>Home Movies</em> for a good long while and did <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/05/fitness-to-the-x-treme/">P90X</a> for a minute).</p>
<p>Here’s Amy being Type-A awesome:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ct8d0b4d7Sg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Lucky for me, however, TV is mother’s milk.  I needs it.  I crave it.  I’d hit another vast wasteland in my TV Guide and found myself jonesing for something, anything.  <em>Parks and Recreation</em> was so close, beckoning to me from my Netflix.  And I watched, skipped ahead some to season 2 and found myself connecting to the program.  Leslie Knope’s sweetly obsessive love of place, her heart inextricably linked to the people, locations, and events of Pawnee &#8212; this started to ring truer.</p>
<p>The oddities of the town began to layer and form a really strange and funny little community.  It’s a white picket fence, country fair kind of place where every mural in the government buildings depicts a vicious massacre, the aggressive stealing of Native American land, and other awesomely gruesome tales that smartly critique and add texture to this story of American small town life.  <em>Parks</em> shows us that the annoying Neighborhood Watch guy or the lady complaining about a pothole at a city council meeting perhaps share blood ties to the colonialist thugs painted on the aforementioned walls.  Where early settlers would have gathered for a nice Sunday witch hanging, new Pawnee gathers around its most famous celebrity resident, a ridiculously adorable mini horse named Lil’ Sebastian.  More than a nod to the show’s politically-saavy and progressive writers, these complex and often twisted representations of community add a pleasing level of quirk and darkness to the show’s typically sunny disposition &#8212; in layman’s terms, it brings the funny.</p>

<p>Having found its Pawnee voice and brushing off some of its initial reliance upon what worked for <em>The Office</em>, <em>Parks</em>’ greatest strength lies in its cast of characters.  Like <em>Buffy</em> in this regard, the show has a clear center in Poehler’s Knope, but it’s the team working together that really matters.  Each character is fleshed out with delightful detail and thus far they haven’t become watered-down catchphrase-spitting caricatures.  Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), with his healthy mustache, masculine code and libertarian values presents a lovely counterpoint to Leslie.  Where Ron eats hefty no-nonsense meals of meaty breakfast food with an almost sexualized gusto, Knope is a hummingbird of progress sucking down sugar at all times, mostly in the form of desserts and whipped cream.  Aubrey Plaza’s deadpan portrayal of April Ludgate, a jerky, lazy hipster has a vocal range of sarcastic to sarcastic-er, and somehow this doesn’t get old. Andy Dwyer is a loveable dope &#8212; it’s hard to play dumb, but Chris Pratt’s acting is endearingly believable. Lately, I’m loving Donna (Retta) a buxom woman of color who don’t give a fuh about anything stupid. She likes fine cars, finer firemen, and yes, her cousin is Genuwine.  She plays nicely with Aziz Ansari’s Tom Haverford, Pawnee’s biggest (physically tiniest) playah.  His big city dreams are more Cristal and Kanye for the Indiana corn maze and tractor pull set, but this mismatch makes for hilarity.  There are even more <em>Parks</em> folk to love, this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>After enjoying <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/16/from-cringe-to-cheer-the-evolution-of-foible-in-parks-recreation/">season two</a> on, I returned to season one and found it more pleasing.  This is a great example of a show that needed to find its rhythm and this is why I’m pushing you to reexamine it.  <em>Parks</em> is smart, <em>Parks</em> is funny, <em>Parks</em> is weird as all get out.  If you were turned off like I was, go back to it, give it another try.  If not for me, then please, please for Little Sebastian.</p>
<p>Here are some more videos for your perusal.  Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to recommend a TV show to people and, in the same breath, say “skip the first season.”* “The whole season?” they’ll ask suspiciously, “why?” “Well it’s only six episodes,” you’ll sheepishly reply, “and the show is completely different from that now.”</p>
<p>That’s not hyperbole. <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Parks_and_Recreation/70143842?trkid=2361637">Parks &amp; Recreation</a> originally started as a spinoff of <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Office_U.S./70136120?trkid=2361637">The Office</a> which was also a spinoff of <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Office_U.K./70136112?trkid=2361637">the UK show by the same name</a>. The original UK show, along with other shows like <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm/70143814?trkid=2361637">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, are considered <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy">cringe comedy</a>.</p>
<p><em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> isn’t alone in it’s subject matter or style. <em>The Office</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> actually have even more in common: NBC’s current Thursday block are all shows about friends of circumstance. <em>30 Rock</em>, <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>, <em>Community</em>, and <em>The Office</em> all deal with groups of people who probably wouldn’t have been friends outside of the work/school circumstance that threw them together. For me, the strength of the show is proportional to the amount of time we see these people outside of the structures that brought them together and, in this regard, <em>Community</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> excel.</p>
<p>Last year I tried to devise a Grand Unified Theory of Comedy. Cringe comedy is a tough thing to nail down. Why is it when a character does something dumb that some people will laugh out loud while others wince and turn away? I think it comes down to the empathy line. Each person has their own internal tipping point where, beyond it, they relate with a character to an extent that they empathize with what’s happening and can’t find it funny. But empathy being both personal and a spectrum means some people laugh out loud at <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> and others can’t even bear to watch it.</p>
<p>I explain all this by way of saying that <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> started out as cringe comedy but over the last two seasons it’s moved the empathy line and is now one of the most inclusive, feel good, <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/05/the-weird-frictionless-politics-of-parks-and-recreation">twee</a> shows ever. This, even more than being one of the funniest shows on TV right now, is its most massive accomplishment.</p>
<p>Still not sure what I mean? The easiest way to show the difference in tone between the start of the show and where it is today is the credits. In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWOZVz9OVnk">the first season credits</a> everyone is grimacing: local government, so irritating! But they revamped the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXNDJnwpvig">credits for the third season</a>: look at how happy everyone is! Don’t you want to watch a show with all these happy people?</p>
<p>How did all these characters become so happy? In season one it was Leslie Knope against the world. Her boss Ron was indifferent, her subordinate Tom was incompetent, and everyone in the government and the town was brutish. But by season three her boss Ron is hands-off, her subordinate Tom is misguided, and everyone in the town is eccentric. It’s a subtle but important shift not just in the way the story and characters are structured but in the way we appreciate the show.</p>
<p>Mark was a central part of the small season one cast but his role of the everyman/love interest was replaced by Ben, an objectively superior character, at the end of season two.  Mark was the stock foil, <em>a la</em> Jim from <em>The Office</em>: generically nice, no strong perspective, an easy cipher for the audience. He’s a mile-wide, inch-deep character that’s great for turning to the camera and shrugging but not much else.</p>
<p>In the last episode of the first season Mark and Leslie kiss and when Leslie stops him Marks says “don’t worry, it’s not a big deal.” It’s this low-stakes, lack of investment that is a hallmark of cringe comedy and which really hurts the character of Mark, any relationships he has, and the show generally. Conversely when Ben expresses his feelings for Leslie it’s done in a high-stakes, grounded relationship which becomes a central focus for the show.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Pawnee is a really special town. I love living there. And I look forward to the moments in my day where I get to hang out with the town. And talk to the town about stuff. And the town has really nice blond hair too, and has read a shocking number of political biographies for a town, which I like.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s affection communicated not just from Ben to Leslie but also from the audience to the characters. When Mark told Leslie “Don’t worry, it’s not a big deal,” that was the same as the audience dismissing Leslie, our protagonist, which is why we cringe. But Ben is embracing Leslie and embracing the increasingly wacky world of <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> and is saying, as the audience cipher, “you’re weird and that’s great.” They’ve moved the empathy line so instead of marginalizing out main character in a smaller realistic world, they’ve created a bigger fictional world in which our protagonist is idolized.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://splitsider.com/2011/08/the-story-of-this-story-is-that-it-wont-stop-developing-the-media-in-parks-and-recreation">town-as-character</a> aspect of <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> is one of the show’s greatest strengths in its evolution from cringe to cheer. In cringe comedy we rely not on invention but convention; the banality is what allows us to cross that empathy line and easily project ourselves onto the characters. For example, in the eight years that <em>The Office</em> has been on the air I’ve learned nothing interesting about the town of Scranton other than it has two <a href="http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/Scranton#Alfredo.27s_Pizza_Cafe">similarly named pizza places</a>. By creating a fictional town full of rich characters, <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> is creating a microcosm of a world with its own unique perspective. This, again, moves the empathy line letting us relate to the characters on their own terms as opposed to viewing them through the prism of how they relate to us. The adorably inept local media are sharks, the internet is stuck in the AltaVista days, the neighboring town is full of preposterously pompous snobs. This richly layered backdrop allows even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Parks_and_Recreation#Orin">a character who’s never said anything</a> to be memorable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the transition from cringe to cheer hasn’t worked well for every character.  The short first season had only one plot, the pit, which revolved around Ann. There was a lot of conflict for her to wrestle with and we got to see her relationships grow, particularly her friendship with Leslie. But once the focus broadened beyond the pit Ann got lost in the shuffle. She’s still stuck in the cringe comedy mindframe: alternately dating, breaking up with, and trying to get back together with boyfriends of all kinds, with no discernible personality. Even when the writers finally realized the had to involve her more centrally in the plot that just amounted to a part time job at City Hall. But it’s not enough; she still drifts through each episode unmoored. In the most recent episode she follows Ron around for no real reason helping to fix things in Andy and April’s house. Every character has a strength, and I hope the writers find Ann’s. They need to either <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlP_3e9RDxE">double down with her</a> like they did with Tom and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX0ZF8f8G0A">Entertainment 720</a> or put her out to pasture like they did Mark.</p>
<p>Forged in the <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152007&amp;trkid=3327070&amp;t=Parks+and+Recreation%3A+Ssn+1%3A+The+Reporter">season one</a> fires of cringe comedy, <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> has earned <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmhohRXn_LY">its adorableness</a>.</p>
<p><i>*So, where should you start? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152011&amp;trkid=3327070&amp;t=Parks+and+Recreation%3A+Ssn+2%3A+Pawnee+Zoo">Season 2 episode 1</a> if you want a fuller arc, or <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152033&amp;trkid=3327070&amp;t=Parks+and+Recreation%3A+Ssn+2%3A+Master+Plan">season 2 episode 23</a> if you want to jump to the introduction of Ben.</i></p>
