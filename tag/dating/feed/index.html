										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all seen those little segments on fluffy morning “news” shows or the similar comparative layouts in fitness magazines &#8212; those ones that urge you to substitute one high-calorie meal for a delicious but healthier alternative. Eat this, not that, they say. You can have a black coffee, sausage sandwich and an orange for the same amount of calories as one of your syrup-soaked, chocolate drizzled, bucket-sized, morning drinks! Do it! Your waistline will thank you!</p>
<p>I present to you a list with a similar idea, only I’m breaking it down for you hottie-style.  &#8220;Date This, Not That&#8221; features those awesome pop culture dudes that get your blood boiling along with more sensible alternatives that will be much better for you.  Carry these lessons into your dating life and feel free to thank me effusively and with gifts later.*</p>

Are you crazy for that muscle-bound frame, that rebellious nature, and those dangerously sexy out-of-this-world meathooks? Well, I love a mutton-chopped jerk as much as the next hipster, but why put up with all that boundless rage and those damn commitment issues when you could find the best in Beast?  Date Henry “Beast” McCoy and you get all the fur with none of the cur!  Erudite vocab, sweet spectacles, and fine manners?  A relationship with this guy will surely last longer than a fling with ol’ Logan.  Beast still has all that animal magnetism going for him, but with this X-Man you can chat about Mozart, Faulkner and molecular biology and stuff.  He’s super agile, so um, use that as you will, and to please your bubby, he’s a doctor!</p>

As Klausner sees it, the strong, confident and vocal Piggies of the world are ready to karate chop their way through the glass ceiling at work and through the gendered song and dance of dating.  Piggy doesn’t mind asking Kermit out, planning the date and paying for it.  She’s a pig of the millennium.  The problem comes when Kermie rarely gives anything back.  He’s content to play his banjo and endlessly obsess about his shows—us satin-gloved gals deserve more care and attention.  </p>

Sweetums, a giant hairy monster, if not the most articulate or finely dressed fella, shares your smash-any-obstacle aggressive approach to life.  Gonzo, though weird and at times annoying is doting, poetic, a romantic.  And my favorite, Scooter, is an organized nerd with a snappy retro sense of style.  This kid has drive (he always makes sure the show is running on time and everyone’s in place) and he shares much of the Weezer-esque qualities of our pal Kermit.  Explore your many options and remember to tell yourself, “Only the best for moi.” </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Don’t date any of these guys.  Just don’t.  Not even Vinnie.</p>

The freckles, the oxfords, that smoking hot ginger sex appeal.  I get it, gf.  But he’s so indecisive and he plays the field.  One week he’s ga-ga for Ronnie, the next he’s letting Betty cook him a romantic meal.  And that jalopy, well, it isn’t exactly the raddest ride in Riverdale.   </p>
<p>What to do?  Reggie is stuck up and jerky, Jughead lacks (non-food-related) motivation, Moose is a sporto and that’s not your bag.  Well, I suggest the Bettys and the Veronicas try dating each other.  You’re already best gal pals and who knows, maybe all that competitiveness and girl drama is covering up a latent attraction.  Seriously, you’ve been chasing Mr. Andrews for 71 years &#8212; it’s not happening.   </p>

<p>Give him a try, too, and report back with copious notes.  </p>
<p>I hope this swapping lesson has been instructive.  Go forth, and may you find your potential mate!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*Full Disclosure, I am married to a ginormous red-head whose goals in life include: 1. Garnering more wizard power than Gandalf himself, 2. Getting better at Lovecraftian alchemy and 3. Probably nothing else because he is “already awesome.”  So, maybe don’t take my advice.  It’s not a science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Listen up, tricks. I’ve been struggling with something lately, and that something is online dating.</p>
<p>I’m not looking to online date per say, as I’m more than a little bit taken, but I’m not exactly asking for a friend either.</p>
<p>You probably don’t know this but online dating sites are very prominent tools in the gayverse. One in particular, <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/" target="_blank">OkCupid</a>, is the undisputed leader, at least here on the coast. Literally every friend I make IRL is on this site. At dinner parties they talk about their match, friend, and enemy percentages with each other. It was like an impenetrable secret language. And because I have a very hard time not participating in social conversations I decided to join. Also, my girlfriend has a profile, and I’m a big believer in relationship equality.</p>
<p>Setting up a profile was easy enough. Pick the two decent photos of yourself taken in the last year. Write some B.S. in the about me section about liking nature and expression and cooking for others (you’ve gotta look marketable). List movies and books and music that make you look smart but not pretentious. Try to write a joke. It’s okay if it’s just a little funny, no one expects you to be Tina Fey. And then, the questions.</p>
<p>Dear god, this site has questions for days. Intimate questions that you not only answer but indicate acceptable answers for potential matches, and then rate the importance of this question to you.</p>
<p>It’s more exhausting than taxes. </p>
<p>My profile is only 80% complete. According to the sidebar threats it will remain at 80% until I write 500 words in my profile. I’m not trying to write a college application essay here. I’m trying to make more friends who like dinosaurs and stupid comedies and nerdy librarian stuff. </p>
<p>I assume online dating is popular in universes other than the queer one I inhabit here in Boston, but I would think to a lesser extent. Though a quick informal survey of my straight friends seems to indicate EVERYone is on this site. We, the people, like that it’s free and that the interface is friendly, and that building your profile works like a personality quiz.</p>
<p>Several of my friends are currently in serious relationships that began on what my friend Jess calls the Cupes. Some of these relationships have lasted longer than many of my other friends’ first marriages. </p>
<p>So what is it about this site that is so appealing to the girl scouts of Boston?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, a lot of us are on there. It also has cool analytics, like what geographical locations would be most favorable to you, getting laid-wise.</p>

<p>It’s a great way to pseudo-stalk lesbians in the area. That way, when you go out with your friends to Queeraoke you can point out everyone in the room you recognize from their profiles and maybe even include awkward message exchange anecdotes. The site acts as a tool for shrinking a kind of disparate, marginalized community. It’s our local coffee shop/ grocery store/ bar. </p>
<p>The demographic is young. And anything that gets popular is able to retain momentum for that reason. You’re not going to use an unpopular dating site and significantly diminish your chances of meeting the lady/dude of your dreams. </p>
<p>According to my friend D., “There is no other way to meet them because they all stay at home with their cats.” You gays, she’s so right. Just because you leave the closet doesn’t mean you leave the living room. </p>
<p>Sites like this make a semi-invisible community more visible to its members. And Boston, being a city of transplants, benefits because all queers need queer friends in their new city, and it’s always better to see a photo or to know before meeting if the person is a big Nickleback fan. It’s inexcusable, no matter how pretty their face is. </p>
<p>I also hear it has great Harry Potter quizzes. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last several months I have been patiently seated in om position on a lofty pedestal of standards and expectations, under the impression that I was acting as a receptor for messages from the universe. Messages about romantic harmony and tolerance and a number of other virtues that catastrophe had tricked me into caring about. Don’t worry, this was temporary. When I fell out of the trance, I landed squarely on my ass.</p>
<p>Tonight I found myself on the couch, drinking beer and eating hot dogs out of the package. I was thinking about the Illuminati and how I knew absolutely nothing about them, and my god did they really exist and when did they originate, and what did they actually do, anyways? The library was closed, but there was Google. It was suddenly imperative to initiate a search and dive headlong into a rabbit hole of fascinating, disjointed information about secret societies. I had a date at 9 pm. At 9:15 pm I am still in my underwear, having melted into a conglomerate of smudged mascara and a bonnet of frizz. I blame humidity and enthusiasm. My phone was on silent so I didn’t see all of those confirmation texts or receive that exasperated voicemail until a few moments ago. Oopsie.</p>
<p>During times of great personal crisis, I tend to retreat into a state of social hibernation. And I have been in a state of lock-down panic. </p>
<p>It goes a little like this: adulthood.</p>
<p>No, wait. It’s worse than that: attempting to date like an adult.</p>
<p>Dating that involves guarded but bubbly conversation over moderately-priced meals. Dating without getting shit hell drunk and just falling madly in bed together. Dating aimed at more than taking care of your basic needs and then hoping to god the person doesn’t Facebook stalk you or suggest brunch. Dating that might prevent you from going home to silence and green tea and the luxury of never having to acknowledge that the person you’re fucking does things like take a dump or think it’s ok to put leftover onions and tomatoes in the same plastic baggie.</p>
<p>After about 5 years of long-distance casual sex with a guy I involuntarily fell in love with, I thought I’d had my come-to-Jesus moment of enlightenment. Arrangements like this one tend to fall apart. And this exploded instead of offering up peaceful disintegration. I lost a best friend and a good lay because for the first time in my life, my heart got the best of me. I thought – this is it, Teal – the universe is calling upon you to step up and represent the fairer sex as a lady, not a well-intentioned delinquent. You’ve finally grown out of this exhausting, nonsensical dance around commitment.</p>
<p>There was this moment of exuberance where I was optimistic about transforming into a woman who didn’t feel like she was caught in the teeth of a bear trap whenever she took on the role of little spoon. A sweaty, snoring bear trap, with a boner lodged in the small of her back when all she wanted to do was sleep. I thought hey, I could learn to like that. I could learn to make that dinner. I saw the light, and I danced right toward it.</p>
<p>I felt empowered and sure of what I wanted. I took a vow of self-imposed celibacy and waited for it to start making sense to me that all of my closest friends are in legally recognized long-term relationships. After all, I respect these people and their decisions, and I even really like their spouses. Try as I might, I couldn’t find a single cell in my rotten heart that could personally relate to this inclination.</p>
<p>Yet I kept waking up in my trademark starfish position, smack dab in the center of my heavenly nest of a bed, to discover that I could turn the light on at 4 am and read without anyone grumbling in annoyance, asking what the fuck time it was and would I not just go the fuck to sleep? I’m at my best from dusk to dawn, when everyone else is resting and I can putter unhindered through ill-conceived art projects or think in circles about abstract intellectual things without being asked distracting questions. I have found that cake tastes the best leftover and refrigerated, eaten in the dark with a glass of milk. That Van Morrison is especially moving when there is no one watching you sashay like you imagine a gypsy would move while you listen to it. I consider these important discoveries in the confines of my happy little life. And I’m just discovering that I might like them best undisturbed and unexamined by affectionate tourists.</p>
<p>My attempts at making nice with strangers while carefully evaluating whether or not I want to see them naked on a regular basis have failed miserably. I was doing really well until my vagina started to make these insane demands of me. And then I realized &#8211; I know in seconds whether or not I want to sleep with someone. But you start actually talking to them, and holy hell they don’t waste a second before spewing information that undermines whatever aesthetic value they possess. It’s like watching a time lapse of a chipping fresco. He ends sentences with prepositions and then volunteers that his reading is limited to Harry Potter and suddenly that entire, beautiful left bicep is no longer even visible.</p>
<p>An escalating series of these failed social experiences has led me to a new personal philosophy. My romantic fantasy is so simple that it’s impossible. It’s built on logic and reads more like a contractual agreement than a matter of the heart. In the past few weeks, I have synthesized these straightforward ground rules into a list I’ve started referring to as the Ten Commandments. Next week, I’m going to be generous and share them with you. But for now, I fucked my way into this mess and I suppose I can probably justify fucking my way back out of it, too. Cheers to pleasure and indulgence, my friends.</p>
