										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really had every intention of skipping the presidential debates this year. It’s not as if I am an undecided voter. Far from it, as I consider many of my inherent civil rights to be at risk this year more than in any year past. And it’s not as if I don’t enjoy a good argument. Ask my husband, my best friend, my father &#8212; pretty much anyone who’s met me &#8212; I consider political and philosophical debate a contact sport, and I play to win. </p>
<p>The anxiety of the last few weeks, amid a barrage of media coverage for the American election, has started to get to me in a way it hasn’t in prior cycles. Maybe it’s because I feel like this country is starting to see real change toward marriage equality and treatment of LGBT citizens, so that any movement backwards is all the more crushing for the steps already taken. Maybe it’s because my tolerance for those that disagree with my point of view lessens for every year I grow older. Either way, the tension is palpable every time I turn on a television or obsessively compare polls on CNN with FOX and The Huffington Post. I have no idea how I’ll manage the next ten days, but I can safely say it won’t be by avoiding the media. To paraphrase the great 1976 satire film <em>Network</em>, I’m mad as hell, but I’m just going to keep on watching. I’m not built for avoiding spoilers, polls, or other foolishness that I could get worked up about. I can barely wait until Wednesday to read my comics, and I’m not about to lose hospital visitation rights from this month’s <em>Superman</em>.</p>
<p>This is not a healthy information ecosystem we’re living in, where one feels compelled to follow the news, jumping from channel to channel, to pick up every last sound bite to exploit or laud for the sake of peace of mind. The experience of an election build-up is barely about politics at this point. There’s no question real differences exist between candidates or parties &#8212; I believe now more than ever. But the process of engaging these figureheads from the comfort of our homes isn’t about defining the differences in any productive sort of way. We are living in an age of 24-hour infotainment designed to simultaneously engage and distract its viewers. The concept of fact checking as a point of contention rather than simply rote only magnifies the circus atmosphere &#8212; masters of illusion follow acrobats of policy, all careful to draw our eyes away from what’s lurking outside the spotlight. One wonders what happens when the tightrope inevitably snaps and the audience can’t unsee the tragedy in front of them. Something much like <em>The Nightly News</em>, I’d wager.</p>
<p>In his debut comic book work, writer/artist Jonathan Hickman sculpts a world so completely like our own that, were it not for the central narrative, one could almost consider <em>The Nightly News</em> a piece of educational non-fiction. Published in 2006 and 2007 by Image Comics, Hickman’s tale centers on a small band of citizens who have been marginalized for one reason or another by the news media. Discredited newsmen discarded only after fulfilling corporate-driven expectations join the ranks of journalistic subjects whose lives have been torn apart by reports gone unchecked. A cult arises, led by a man known as the Hand, who answers to and spreads the instructions of the Voice &#8212; the undisputed mastermind of what becomes a systematic bloodbath of the media, those used to being the manipulators themselves.</p>

<p>Hickman lays out his premise systematically, fact checking his own thesis on media control through a juxtaposition of character monologues with infographic-style presentations &#8212; topics ranging from monetary globalization to Ritalin prescription among pre-teens, media credibility surveys and more. His protagonists are notably terrorists, even gunning down an innocent man to draw out their supposedly guilty journalistic targets. Yet the case is made so eloquently for their cause that one can’t help but rally them on and experience some amount of disappoint as the first cracks in their mission planning appear. Clearly, the cult at work here mirrors the agenda of its own targets. It is a subversively appealing set of heroes, conveying exactly what its members (and the reader) wants to hear, with the vigor of righteousness behind every word. Violently eliminating one reporter after another may seem unjustifiable, until one is a fly on the wall of backroom dealings and private barroom boasts. Newsmen and senators speak glibly of educating and entertaining the masses as if they were a mob in the Coliseum. Nevertheless, it becomes clear as the series goes on that far more subtle manipulations are at work than the patently obvious, leaving the reader to question revolution as profoundly as the threatening institution itself.</p>

<p>Further complicating the message behind <em>The Nightly News</em> is Hickman’s unbelievably stunning series design, a perfect metaphor for the glossy veneer coating both media presentation of the news and the captivating direction of a cult. Drawing on his own career as a graphic designer, Hickman wraps his story in an unbearably beautiful style reminiscent of the very pop culture-infused structure he’s critiquing. Repeated patterns of circles within circles &#8212; reminiscent of the Target brand logo &#8212; combine with painstaking photo-reference. Captions litter the page in perfectly chosen positions, breaking to detailed charts and figures in a style most commonly found in a corporate annual report. The tightly controlled color palette (warm for the events of today, cool for those of the past) and meticulously aligned text boxes make for an almost perfect page structure, if not for the aggressive breaks Hickman employs to let us know nothing is truly that pristine. </p>
<p>Shattering the seamlessness of each page, the Hand and his followers appear as solitary figures with ragged white halos, almost crackling with energy against the graphic conformity expected of them. Apparently random white specks grace nearly every page, as if blood drops or paint splatters intended to mar the cleanliness of the carefully planned artistic canvas. Detailed backgrounds are replaced with repeated line pattern fading to watercolor brushed hues, seemingly an artist-saving device, but in fact serving a greater purpose: characters can appear simultaneously solitary and agitated against an ever-changing kaleidoscope of cultural detritus. The convoluted gestalt of the page layout alone could tell the tale of a society going mad on its own twisted communication framework.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10727" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/10/25/the-media-is-the-message/nn3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nn3.jpeg" data-orig-size="640,715" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="NN3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nn3.jpeg?w=269" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nn3.jpeg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nn3.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=715" alt="ragged halo" title="NN3" width="640" height="715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10727" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nn3.jpeg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nn3.jpeg?w=134&amp;h=150 134w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/nn3.jpeg?w=269&amp;h=300 269w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><em>The Nightly News</em>, even five years later, stands as a dire warning not just against blind trust in media, but against blind faith in revolution as well. There are no bad guys or good guys &#8212; angels or demons &#8212; unilaterally fit to decide what is best for the whole of society. What we have instead are agendas, forthright or masked, for a savvy audience to determine, with most assuredly more than two on the table at any given time. As certain as I am about my allegiance in this forthcoming election, I am much less convinced of the impartial delivery of its facts and conclusions than ever before. The truth is, whether I choose to tune in or out on the evening of November 6, it’s unquestionably going to be a very long night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games are a troublesome medium. Rogert Ebert, famously, <a target="new" href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html">isn&#8217;t convinced that they&#8217;re art</a>. Even those of us who love video games are often apologetic. Yes, many video games are just terrible. Yes, it&#8217;s true that no video game can stand up to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or Beethoven&#8217;s Fifth Symphony, or <em>Ulysses</em>. (Or maybe <em>War &amp; Peace</em>, if you&#8217;re the sort of person who doesn&#8217;t like <em>Ulysses</em>. I happen to like <em>Ulysses</em>.)</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m primarily interested in video games as a medium for narrative and story, not despite but because I think it&#8217;s an open question whether video games are particularly well-suited to narrative.</p>
<p>In fact, depending on what and how you read, the idea of video games as a venue for narrative is in trouble right now. This week, IGN ran a piece on <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/118/1185726p1.html" target="_blank">the end of the $60 single-disc big-budget video game</a> in favor of less-expensive segmented downloads. (This business model is actually not all that far from a lot of &#8220;single-disc&#8221; games, which offer players the opportunity to purchase and download additional content &#8212; &#8220;DLC&#8221; &#8212; after the initial purchase of the physical disc. It just eliminates the requirement that the player buy the disc first.) <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6828237/beyond-angry-birds" target="_blank">Tom Bissell&#8217;s piece in Grantland</a> makes explicit the implied stakes of the low-cost, low-budget gaming world to come:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few months ago, a producer at a major video-game company startled me by admitting that the economic viability of the triple-A video-game production cycle — the expensive development process, in other words, by which games like Halo, Grand Theft Auto, Uncharted, and BioShock are unleashed upon the world — is in all likelihood doomed. Shortly after that, a developer told me he has a hard time imagining how single-player narrative video games are going to survive in the long run; such games, he believes, will eventually be seen as a historical anomaly. Neither man was particularly thrilled to imagine a future largely absent of the kinds of games he makes and most cares about, but current trends could not be ignored.</p>
<p>I told the developer that he sounded a bit like my fiction-writer friends going on about the inevitable death of the novel. &#8220;It takes one person to write a novel,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;To make the kinds of games we&#8217;re talking about, you need several dozen people — probably more like a hundred — with training across several fields. If the money&#8217;s not there, which is increasingly the case, the games can&#8217;t be made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that Bissell&#8217;s skepticism of the developer&#8217;s assertion is well-founded. The sky may well be falling, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that everything is coming to an end. Much like the death of the studio system that controlled prewar American filmmaking, the end of a particular business model will not mean the end of a medium.</p>
<p>While Bissell&#8217;s piece focuses on iPad games, including a number that tell stories surprisingly well, I&#8217;d like to try to shift the terms of the conversation a bit. (An ambitious goal, I know, but I&#8217;m going to take for granted that <em>Idler</em> readers will know from Andrew Simone&#8217;s writing that <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/02/essential-indie-games/" target="_blank">indie/web browser games can tell outstanding and challenging stories with incredibly limited resources</a>.)</p>
<p>First, there is a central mistake in considering whether video games as a medium are well-suited for narrative. The implied analogy is between video games and a genre like the novel or the fiction film, where narrative tools are built into the conceptual framework of the work itself. Video games, however, are a <em>medium</em> and not a <em>genre</em>. The more appropriate analogy would be between the video game and the book. Video games, like books, can be a productive venue for narrative, but like books, video games can be successful entirely independent of whether narrative exists within the individual work, and the success, failure, or indifference of the individual work is immaterial to the larger question as to whether narrative can work within a video game. A book of poetry may entirely ignore narrative, but it would be foolish to conclude from the fact that many great books exist which contain no narrative all that books are ill-suited to telling stories.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-media comparisons can be occasionally illuminating, but to judge video games by the narrative standards and conventions of the novel, opera, drama, or the fiction film is ultimately a mistake. Will video games ever produce a <em>Ulysses</em>? Clearly not. <em>Ulysses</em> already exists. Video games would (and do) do better to measure by and build on its own benchmarks.</p>
<p>And video games <em>do</em> tell some compelling stories, using their own tools, and with their own unique strengths and flaws. Rather than figuring out whether <em>Heavy Rain</em> is as good as your favorite novelist, however, let&#8217;s talk about what makes its story work, and try to imagine what stories video games could (and should) be telling, especially if the big-budget, risk-averse, &#8220;let&#8217;s-make-another-sequel&#8221; business model comes crashing down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my challenge to video game critics, players, and creators. I&#8217;ll do what I can to live up to it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just which set of lips is this supposed to wet, exactly? I ask myself.</p>
<p>It’s late, I am alone, bathed in the light of the television, taking in noises of pleasure that transcend all language barriers. You can’t blame me for watching. I flipped to it on accident. And now I can’t look away.</p>
<p>The way the rich chocolate batter rolls off of the spatula in coagulated bulbs and folds, the way the chocolate chips crest and disappear as they are stirred into the bowl. And I think, this is it. Here comes the money shot. The camera zooms in closer.</p>
<p>There is an eerie similarity between gourmet cooking shows and pornography. The way that they are cut and filmed, the strange correlation between the purposes of both; to build desire with sensory stimulation, and then to satisfy with the promise of pleasure. I don’t believe this is any accident, although it is a truth full of sad irony.</p>
<p>America’s avid indulgence in both gluttony and lust has created a cultural paradigm where people harbor a great deal of neurosis about both. This is evident on several levels: food and sex are everywhere, and as a society we consume like gluttons, then lust for more&mdash;newer, bigger, faster, better. Whether this means casual sex with multiple partners or trying every position illustrated in Kama Sutra, paying top dollar for rare truffles in a Michelin restaurant, or simply stepping into the cereal aisle and being confronted with everything from All Bran to Fruit Loops&mdash;there are an overwhelming number of options. Not to mention substitutes.</p>
<p>You know there is a broad market for something when there is a wealth of competing products. Furthering the cereal example, consumers could choose oatmeal, muffins, granola bars, or protein shakes&amp;dash;naming just a few alternate breakfast options. With sex, the proliferation of toys, costumes, and accoutrements mirrors our fixation. Demand seems to be driving supply in both cases, and they both receive incredible amounts of media attention. The number of cooking and baking blogs popping up on the internet has to be rivaling the amount of porn.</p>
<p>Eating has long since become more an act of pleasure than nourishment. Most people aren’t having sex regularly with the goal of making babies. The two become entirely connected when you consider the market for diet or sexual enhancement products, and how advertising targets our insecurities about both.</p>
<p>Indulgence seems to often be followed by a cycle of guilt and self-imposed punishment for partaking. We have a very complicated relationship with pleasure. It’s our obsession and our shame, great joy and frequent disappointment. Eating your feelings is a common joke about comforting oneself, but I know a great deal of people who have tried to fuck their feelings, too. </p>
<p>There is a voyeuristic way to how we view both food and sex in the media, but I’m beginning to wonder if the two are not becoming interchangeable options for pleasure. Has the American Dream mutated into seeking constant, uninterrupted, unthinking stimulation and pleasure? </p>
<p>What does this say about the state of sex? What does this say about the state of food?</p>
