										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have walked out of a film once in my life and sat through a great deal more that I probably shouldn’t have (<em>Lady in the Water</em> (2006) comes to mind). That one time occurred when a friend of mine, who was a fan of kung-fu films but lacked the healthy irony such fandom requires, had convinced me to attend a screening of Jackie Chan’s <em>Mr. Nice Guy</em> (1997). Chan &#8212; who, for the record I usually find to be relatively charming and entertaining &#8212; plays a Chinese chef who gets embroiled in a drug bust, or something like that. The opening sequence was so choppy and poorly executed that I had to put the kibosh on that viewing. Plus, <em>Boogie Nights</em> (1997) was playing in the next theatre over and it was about porn.</p>
<p>It turned out that <em>Boogie Nights</em> wasn’t really <em>about</em> porn, which was disappointing. It turned out to be a film about family and acceptance. It turned out to be pretty amazing, which was less disappointing. I immediately began to check up on the film&#8217;s director, Paul Thomas Anderson, and learned that, despite thinking that I had discovered a new filmmaker that evening, I had actually had his very first film, <em>Hard Eight</em> (1996) sitting in my collection for quite some time (on VHS. Yikes).</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Hard Eight" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dc/Hardeight.jpg/220px-Hardeight.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="323" />Back in the day, when video stores were abundant, I used to make a regular practice out of scrapping together some cash and trolling their aisles. I would watch anything and everything with an interesting cover. One day I stumbled across <em>Hard Eight</em>, starring Phillip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly and Gwyneth Paltrow. I’m not even sure what made me pick it up. The cover was unassuming. Just images of each of the actor&#8217;s faces with some dice next to them. I must have thought that there would be some nudity (Give me a break! I was still in high school, after all). It was billed as a casino thriller, but turned out to be a far cry from it.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that <em>Boogie Nights</em> was about family &#8212; specifically the idea that blood doesn’t necessarily make a family and that one can find family anywhere, even in the porn industry &#8212; but the theme is pervasive in Anderson&#8217;s work. <em>Magnolia</em> (1999), his epic follow-up to <em>Boogie Nights</em>, is filled with broken and makeshift families. The protagonist of <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> (2002) is dealing with an overbearing gaggle of sisters who have, in a way, created a monster, and <em>There Will Be Blood</em> (2007) places a fair amount of weight on Daniel Plainview’s (poor) relationship with his son and his imposter brother. It is no surprise that <em>Hard Eight</em> is really about family as well.</p>
<p>The film’s protagonist, Sydney (Which was the original name of the film and, for some time after the film&#8217;s release, the only title Paul would acknowledge), played by the immensely talented Phillip Baker Hall, meets a young man named John (John C.Reilly) sitting outside of a diner just outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. John is down on his luck and Sydney kindly, if not somewhat randomly, offers to buy him a cup of coffee and give him a cigarette. As the story goes, the scene that follows, the scene where John confesses to Sydney that he’s been in Vegas trying to win enough money to pay for his mother&#8217;s funeral over coffee and cigarettes, is a scene Anderson wrote after dropping out of film school, having only been there for a few weeks. He says that he left and got his tuition returned to him after<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V89yFMHXynk"> turning in a copy of a scene from David Mamet’s <em>Hoffa</em> (1992) and getting a C+. </a></p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="John and Sydney" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hardeightpic.jpg?w=280&#038;h=210" alt="" width="280" height="210" />Sydney teaches John how to get by in Vegas, a city where, if one is crafty enough, one doesn’t really need to get a “real job.” The Vegas that Anderson portrays here is not the glitz and glam that we’re used to. Instead, we get a glimpse of the real deal, Fremont Street at noon. Sparsely-lit casinos occupied by the sad and desperate.  </p>
<p>Time passes with John and Sydney becoming fast friends. A pretty waitress named Clementine (Gwyneth Paltrow) catches John’s eye, which catches Sydney’s. Sydney gets to know her and discovers that she’s not unlike John, wide-eyed, damaged. He also notices that John’s been hanging around with a less desirable companion named Jimmy (Samuel L. Jackson), who knows a little something about Sydney’s past.</p>
<p>Eventually, more than halfway through the film, the plot catches up with the synopsis on the back of the VHS sleeve with John and Clementine finding themselves hiding in a hotel room with an unconscious man tied to their bed. How they got there is almost inconsequential. What is of great consequence is how Anderson uses this familiar scenario (disposing of the witness) to reveal a great deal about his characters, letting them drive the scene in unexpected directions.</p>
<p>When Sydney had last left Clementine and John they were preparing to head out shopping after Sydney had agreed to take Clementine in. He had discovered that she was occasionally going home with her customers for extra cash and took pity on her. Now, Sydney stands outside of a hotel room begging John to let him in after John himself had called him for help with a “situation.” John eventually lets him in, but only after Sydney promises not to be mad.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Paul Thomas Anderson" src="https://i2.wp.com/famous-relationships.topsynergy.com/!photos/Paul_Thomas_Anderson.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="230" />During this crucial scene we learn of John’s pliable good nature. He wants only to please those around him, and he’s just a touch stupid. We see the depths of Clementine’s damage, as the situation is explained to Sydney, the disappointed father. Hours before the hotel room incident, John and Clem had gotten married. Shortly thereafter, Clem had picked up another man at the bar and gone to the hotel with him. When he didn’t pay her she called John. John, not knowing how to handle such a situation, called Jimmy. Jimmy’s advice was, needless to say, less than helpful.</p>
<p>Sydney takes care of things like a professional. The professional he used to be. But the key moment for him is in his reaction to John telling him about the marriage. For a moment Sydney’s weathered, stoic face betrays joy. Not only a proud father, but a man who senses a balance shift within himself, wrongs being righted.</p>
<p>We soon learn that Sydney is responsible for the death of John’s father. Again, the circumstances are not important. What Sydney does for John in the film&#8217;s beginning and in the final moments is what really matters. Sydney, having sent Clem and John away to safety, deals with Jimmy, who has discovered his secret and is threatening to tell John if Sydney doesn’t pay up. He takes care of Jimmy the only way he knows how; the old way.</p>
<p>Anderson has shown a remarkable ability to tell a familiar story in a unique manner throughout his entire career. <em>Hard Eight</em> may not be the flashiest nor the most epic, but there is brilliance is in its subtlety. It is a Vegas movie that isn’t about Vegas, a gangster movie that isn’t about gangsters. Mostly, though, it is a film about a father’s atonement. It’s about wanting better for your child. It’s about the moment when Sydney, returning to the very same diner where he first  met John after “taking care” of Jimmy, looks down and notices a spot of blood on his shirt cuff. Gently, he pulls down his jacket sleeve to cover it up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>The shotgun would ignite, and Ella Mae would scream, but Robert Ford would only lay on the floor and look at the ceiling, the light going out of his eyes before he could find the right words.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Finding “the right words” is a quest all writers are intimately familiar with. Everyone knows that it’s not what you say, but how you say it. Dialogue, great dialogue, can be like music, expressing the profound in a manner that can be universally understood and, more importantly, felt. Also, “nobody has gotten a hand job in cargo shorts since ‘nam!” is a pretty funny line.</p>
<p>I can recall times when a great line has saved a scene and, in some cases, an entire movie for me. In the best of times it is a cherry on top, as is the case with the quote preceding this piece. It is spoken by the narrator of <em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert</em> <em>Ford</em> (2007) in the film’s final moments. It is poetic, to be sure, but it is also the perfect summation of the character of Robert Ford, a man so starved for fame and the attention and validation that comes with it that it drove him to murder his idol.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the line, “<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/03/watching-a-sad-movie-why-dont-you-cry-about-it/">Say goodbye to Frankie, Dad</a>”, before, which functions as an exhaling of the long-held breath that is <em>In America </em>(2003). But that film is full of beautiful lines, made all the more beautiful by their context. One such scene involves Johnny, an Irish immigrant grieving the death of his son, playing with his two daughters. He chases them around their sad, dilapidated Hell’s Kitchen apartment blindfolded and crying, “Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Irish woman!” The girls scream with delight, but soon Johnny slips up: “Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Irish man!” He removes the blindfold and the game grinds to a halt, the girls peering out from their hiding places. He realizes that he was looking for his son. Johnny’s wife approaches.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Play with the girls, Johnny.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As stand alone lines they are unremarkable. Given their context – the idea that life goes on, that these children are still here and they need their father – they are quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Sometimes dialogue can serve to enhance the overall aesthetic of a film, as is the case with the Coen brother’s brilliant <em>Miller’s Crossing</em> (1990). It isn’t so much a gangster film as a film about gangster films, utilizing a stylized form of slang-laden dialogue (Twists = Women. You know, because they get you all twisted) fondly remembered in older films like <em>Little Caesar</em> (1931) and <em>White Heat</em> (1949). While <em>Miller’s Crossing</em> is full of brilliant dialogue, one exchange in particular stuck with me. Tommy, Irish gangster and mob bosses right hand man, has just punctuated a rousing verbal sparring match with a “twist” (a woman) by smashing her vanity mirror. As she casually strolls away, without even turning back to face him, she delivers this final blow:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I suppose you think you raised hell?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Tommy counters with, “<em>Sister, when I’ve raised hell you’ll know it”, </em>but we all know who won that argument.</p>
<p>There are film makers who have come to be at least partially defined by their dialogue. David Mamet, who doubles as a playwright, has a distinctive voice, his dialogue marching to its own beat. Take this exchange from the brilliant <em>Glenngarry Glen Ross </em>(1992):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You got leads. Mitch &amp; Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them. You can&#8217;t close the leads you&#8217;re given, you can&#8217;t close shit, *you are* shit, hit the bricks pal, and beat it, &#8217;cause you are going *out*.</em></p>
<p><em>The leads are weak.</em></p>
<p><em>“The leads are weak?” The fucking leads are weak? You’re weak. I’ve been in this business fifteen years!</em></p>
<p><em>What’s your name?</em></p>
<p><em>Fuck you. That’s my name. You know why, mister? ‘Cause you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight. I drove an eighty thousand dollar BMW. THAT’S my name.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Thomas Anderson’s characters will often make oddly formal, declarative statements. Like when Barry, from 2002’s <em>Punch Drunk Love</em> tells his brother-in-law that he “cries sometimes, for no reason,” then asks, “Can you help me?” His brother-in-law kindly responds by reminding Barry that he is a Chiropractor. There is also the put upon Donnie Smith from <em>Magnolia</em> (1999), who declares that he “has so much love to give. I just don’t know where to put it.”</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but what I’d really like to know is what some of your favorite lines or exchanges of dialogue are, and why? Seriously, don’t just feed me the dialogue. There has to be a reason it resonates with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had found what I had been looking for, cinematically speaking, but what of Altman’s interaction with his cast and crew? I mean, love him or leave him, nobody makes films like Altman. The man’s even had an “esque” attributed to his name! As in: “That film’s very Altman-esque.” No small accomplishment.</p>
<div style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Robert Altman" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.idolator.com/assets/resources/2006/11/robert_altman_150_150x180.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="180" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The man</p></div>
<p>Of course a film starts and ends with clarity of vision, and Altman never doubted himself there. In AFI’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Directors-Robert-Altman/dp/B00004TJR6/ref=sr_1_2?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1305026397&amp;sr=1-2">Directors series</a></em>, he states that he firmly believed that every film he’d ever made was his best, at least while he was making it. This level of confidence was a double-edged sword for most folks that had to work with him. It was as though he had already completed the film and was just waiting for everyone else to catch up. That sounded mighty familiar to me.</p>
<p>He was generous with his actors, however, and depending on that actors approach this was either a curse or a blessing. If Altman had bothered to hire you it was probably because he had already thought you could take of business. Why would you ask <em>him</em> how to do <em>your</em> job? Most actors enjoyed the freedom. Donald Sutherland, who played “Hawkeye” in <em>M*A*S*H</em>, tried to have him fired. There’s a story during the filming of <em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</em> where Warren Beatty, who starred as McCabe (Although I’m sure he would have made a lovely Mrs. Miller), wanted to reshoot a scene Altman had already deemed completed. After a bit of verbal tennis, Altman agreed to the reshoot then, snuck off set and went to bed while Beatty indulged himself. No surprise, Altman’s version made the final cut.</p>
<p>Studio execs in particular had a hard time with Altman’s “I’ve got this,” attitude. He couldn’t be bothered with their notes, often times maintaining his modus operandi until they came around to his way of thinking. Dear god that must have been annoying! I’ll have to ask my professors.</p>
<p>Altman himself held no grudges. “How can I be mad at them? They sell shoes. I make gloves.”</p>
<p>As I began delving into his later films, I realized that there simply hasn’t been, and most likely never will be, another Robert Altman. His films are unique, and they are uniquely his. He was recognized by the Academy in 2002 for his brilliant <em>GosfordPark</em>, which featured an all-star cast (Including Bob Balaban, whom I have an almost inexplicable soft spot for) and more of his trademark layered dialog and even more layered storylines. It won for Best Screenplay, but lost both the Best Director and Best Picture to Ron Howard’s <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>.</p>
<div style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="A Prairie Home Companion" src="https://i2.wp.com/nashville.ismyhome.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/prairie-home-companion-nashville.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="182" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Time to say goodbye</p></div>
<p>Altman’s swan song came in 2006 in the form of a sweet, sentimental collaboration with NPR’s Garrison Keillor. <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em> chronicled the last performance of a staged radio show that mirrored Keillor’s own. Its characters are as close as family, but the rest of the world seems to have lost use for them. As they try to keep their collective chin’s up, even as an “axe man” (A nice, subtle Tommy Lee Jones performance) looms over the shows final moments, we get a glimpse into Altman himself. Altman, like the cast of <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>, staunchly refused to quit doing what he loved. He passed away shortly after making this one. They say he was in preproduction on another film even as he lay in his deathbed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every show’s your last show<br />
&mdash;Garrison Keillor, <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I later learned that, due to insurance reasons, Paul Thomas Anderson himself had been Altman’s back up director, even shooting a few scenes while Altman was out sick. Both of my idols on the same set at the same time! What I wouldn’t give to have been there, even if I had to fetch coffee.</p>
<p>I remember thinking about Altman at a very specific moment in film school. We had been given an assignment in our directing class to shoot, edit and screen a commercial or PSA of our own design. We only had the school’s equipment (and what little we may have procured on our own) and our fellow classmates as cast and crew. We had two weeks or so to complete this project. I waited.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>Eventually (the last day we had to shoot, to be precise), I sat down and wrote a strange little PSA about the <a href="http://youtu.be/d4nRZ4RsPKI">benefits of having facial hair</a>. Minutes later I was corralling a small cast and crew, the cream of the crop, and shooting. More minutes later I was hunched over a laptop editing. Even more minutes later I was handing in my final project, which got an “A,” thank you very much.</p>
<p>It struck me that that was how Altman would’ve have done it; within his own timeline and on his own terms. It helped that he was good. I like to think I’m alright too. I’d better be, because Robert Altman has created a monster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a solid stretch of time during my early goings in film school where I thought that I might be in some trouble. I worried about my disinterest in traditional screenplays or, more to the point, the screenplay itself. That is not as to say that I didn’t and don’t appreciate them (I read <em>The Social Network’s</em> script twice), I simply didn’t and don’t have the attention span for them, generally speaking. I was only interested in the translation of moments and images from my head to the screen. If only it were so simple.<strong></strong></p>
<p>As it stands I still rush through scripts, both when reading and writing. Why can’t a cast and crew just translate what appears to be incoherent, occasionally serial killer-esque scrawlings in a notebook? Why doesn’t it make a difference when I assure them that “I’ve got this”? Why can’t everyone just be brilliant so that I don’t have to worry?</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Magnolia poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/images.moviepostershop.com//magnolia-movie-poster-1020184933.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="226" />As is my nature, instead of accepting that I am doing things the wrong way and adapting, I began seeking justification for my approach. My tireless efforts to find a kindred spirit were rewarded when a filmmaker I was obsessed with at the time, Paul Thomas Anderson, led me to a filmmaker <em>he</em> had been obsessed with all his young life: Robert Altman. He had cited Altman as a major influence on his film, <em>Magnolia</em> (1999), a sprawling, multi-character melodrama that had blown me away (still does) and insisted upon multiple viewings (no small feat for a three-hour film about cancer). I immediately snagged a copy of <em>Short Cuts</em> (1993), which, being a sprawling, multi-character melodrama itself, seemed like as good a place to start as any. It didn’t hurt that it was based on multiple short stories by Raymond Carver, whom I love.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Short Cuts poster" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.moviepostershop.com/short-cuts-movie-poster-1993-1020243508.jpg" alt="" width="154" height="230" />Altman’s influence on <em>Magnolia</em> was immediately apparent, particularly in the camera work, which glided, pushed in and zoomed like it was trying to take in everything while simultaneously maintaining focus on its protagonists. The similarities between <em>Short Cuts</em> and <em>Magnolia</em> gave me an access point, but there was something about Altman’s film, something I hadn’t come across in all my years of cinematic bingeing. I immediately hit imdb.com, jotted down every film Altman had ever made or been involved with and went to work. I read interviews. I watched behind the scenes footage. This guy had some pretty radical ideas. He cared little for screenplays, even his own. They were just an excuse to set up a camera.</p>
<p>That’s not as to say that he didn’t use them, it’s just that he really only needed to read them once, you know, so he knows what the movie’s about, then he was off and running. Often times he would show up on set and ask what scene they were shooting that day. He has said that screenplays were just a means by which he could remember all of the character’s names. The truth is, regardless of his approach, he loved a good story. He loved a good character even more.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="M*A*S*H Screen cap" src="https://i2.wp.com/ereview.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/mash.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="161" />The second Altman film I saw was full of characters. <em>M*A*S*H</em> (1970) was, in fact, all character and next to no story. Most of us know these names by now: “Hawkeye” Pierce, Trapper John, Major Frank Burns and “Hot Lips” Houlihan. Stationed in an M*A*S*H unit in Korea (Altman insists that it’s actually Vietnam. The studio made him change it), these characters pass their time with pranks, shenanigans and “friendly” games of football, all the while dealing with the surrounding (Vietnam) war and the atrocities that come with it. It is the darkest of dark comedies, the kind of film that usually has a hard time getting made. Altman himself has said that it probably wouldn’t have had the studio not been distracted by numerous other projects sure to garner more profit. He was pretty much left to his own devices, which resulted in a Best Picture and Best Director Oscar nomination. It won for Best Screenplay, which is funny because the screenplay is actually quite dull and, ironically, not very funny. It’s a good thing that he cares little for them.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Popeye Screen cap" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.filmjunk.com/images/weblog/2011/02/flixpopeye.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#039;s actually kind of charming, in its own way</p></div>
<p>As I delved further into Altman’s filmography I found that he was no stranger to genre-bending, subversive and, occasionally strange projects. <em>Brewster McCloud</em> (1970), for example, is about a boy who lives in a fall out shelter and dreams of being able to fly. It’s a strange one, to be sure, but it actually works in its own way. Some of them didn’t. <em>A Perfect Couple</em> (1979) is a film brimming with good ideas that don’t make sense in conjunction with one another, and the post-apocalyptic, sci-fi “thriller,” <em>Quintet</em> (1979) is nearly unwatchable. <em>Pret-a-Porter</em> (1994) holds little interest to those with even less interest in the fashion industry. You’ll notice that I didn’t mention what is widely considered to be one of Altman’s biggest flops, <em>Popeye</em> (1980). That’s because I like it. Deal with it.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller poster" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.sivideo.com/facets/McCabe%20and%20Mrs.%20Miller.jpg" alt="" width="159" height="233" />Nobody&#8217;s perfect, but when he hits the ball squarely he knocks it out of the park. I had a string of good luck with the next few films, all made in what I consider to be the best decade for cinema: the ‘70’s (We’ll ignore ’79, the year Altman stumbled, then tried to regain his footing for nearly a decade). <em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</em> (1971) is a brilliant, subtle anti-western fueled by the melancholy music of Leonard Cohen. Its story is simple: A mysterious man with a past rides into an upstart town and teams up with a prostitute to run a successful brothel. The characters are familiar. What isn’t familiar, as usual, is Altman’s approach. His gunslinger may be more lucky than skilled and the films big shoot out is quite unorthodox. Could you imagine John Wayne sneaking up behind someone and shooting them in the back? The final moments are at once brilliant and tragic.</p>
<p>I followed that one up with <em>California Split</em> (1974), which featured the brilliant Elliott Gould and George Segal (Yep, the boss from <em>Just Shoot Me</em>. Remember that show? Of course you don’t) as a couple of gambling addicts destined for the big let down. It’s little known, but I believe it to be one of Altman’s best. There’s even more Elliot Gould gold (see that?!) in <em>The Long Goodbye</em> (1973), in which Altman turns the private eye genre (and the character of Phillip Marlowe) on its ear. His decision to translate the Marlowe character’s noir, inner dialogue into inane, outward babbling is inspired and Gould pulls it off perfectly. Another favorite.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Nashville poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/images.moviepostershop.com/nashville-movie-poster-1975-1020170567.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="258" />I capped it off with the film many consider to be his masterpiece: <em>Nashville</em> (1975). Like <em>M*A*S*H</em>, <em>Nashville</em> is a film about people, not plot. It is also a film about time and place, with Altman’s pioneering use of layered dialog creating a palpable energy that firmly places you within the its world. There is always something happening, even when nothing is happening, and he insists that you pay attention. Altman was on a roll.</p>
<p>Many believe that roll halted after that <em>Popeye</em> debacle I mentioned earlier, and the ‘80’s saw him delving into more personal, smaller films. He looked to theatre, adapting stage plays like <em>Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean</em> (1982), <em>Streamers</em> (1983), <em>Secret Honor</em> (1984), <em>Fool for Love</em> (1985) and <em>Beyond Therapy</em> (1987), to varying degrees of success. He did occasionally try to hit a mainstream target, but often missed ala’ the aforementioned <em>Popeye</em> and the awkward and disposable teen flick, <em>O.C. and Stiggs </em>(1985). For my money, <em>Popeye</em>, <em>Fool for Love</em> and <em>Secret Honor</em> are all pretty great, even if the box office didn’t agree.</p>
<p>His renaissance came in the form of <em>The Player</em> (1990), which skewered Hollywood in expert fashion and featured multiple stars playing caricatures of themselves. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0epB5Z6ijpk">The opening shot</a> is brilliantly staged and lasts for over seven minutes. I doubled back after <em>The Player</em> and viewed <em>A Wedding</em> (1978), about an upper class family wedding gone awry. It’s another underrated Altman film, featuring multiple characters and layered dialog. It was clear to me at this point that his films were changing the way I viewed and approached the medium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Musicals tell their stories with sweeping camerawork, song, dance, and big emotions.  They are the height of melodrama, and after five films and several television and music video stints it’s surprising to me that director Paul Thomas Anderson has never made one.</p>
<p>Often referred to as a “self-taught” or “VCR” filmmaker, Anderson learned all he needed about the craft from watching the films themselves.   Everyone talks about his Scorsese-style camerawork and his Altman-esque proclivity towards ensemble casts, but rarely do you hear mention of what I believe is his most obvious influence: the musical.  That Scorsese camerawork is there for sure, but Anderson’s is even bigger.  It draws more attention to itself.   And those Altman-sized casts are always inches away from breaking into song and dance!  Anderson resists the urge to let it loose, but it sneaks out here and there.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKcdOWCj5fQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>Even more than technical similarity, it’s really Anderson&#8217;s use of  music that signals his genre proclivities.  He almost always puts music in the foreground.  <em>Boogie Nights</em> thrives on its period disco soundtrack, right up until the pivotal Alfred Molina drug deal scene, when Rick Springfield and Night Ranger take over.  <em>Magnolia</em> is driven by the music of Aimee Mann, in some cases quoting her directly.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/KsdY8QOBDTc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> <iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/gC96_vph-oI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> and <em>There Will be Blood</em>, both of which use music as a direct outward expression of their protagonists&#8217; inner being.  There is, for example, the scene in <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> in which Barry Egan&#8217;s sister stomps towards him to a pot-and-pan-banging soundtrack beefed up with an almost tribal drumbeat, both of which emphasize her anger.  When Barry calls up a phone sex hotline the soundtrack whispers and purrs along with the operator.  Not to mention the inclusion of Shelley Duvall&#8217;s &#8220;He Needs Me,&#8221; lifted directly from the soundtrack of Robert Altman&#8217;s <em>Popeye</em>, which happens to be a musical!</p>
<p>Even the great oil epic <em>There Will be Blood</em> opens musically with one chilling, minor note signaling the madness to come.  And its burning oil derrick scene is accompanied by a mad looping of clangs, pops, whirs and bangs.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/d9Q1vM2vPIk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>All of these films contain signs that Anderson is right on the cusp of releasing his inner Busby Berkeley, but those signs are never more blatant than they are in his video for Fiona Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Paper Bag,&#8221; which serves to demonstrate how naturally the genre comes to him.  How, if he could just cut loose, those precise long takes of his could easily become sweeping, epic camera moves, the kind that dance right along with the actors.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BK30r_SIZ-g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>Get a load of that camera work!  See any similarities?</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1ZYhVpdXbQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>I recently learned that Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s latest film, tentatively titled <em>The Master</em>, has been delayed indefinitely.  It may be a sign.  Now&#8217;s your chance, Paul!  Let loose!  Go forth and make that musical you&#8217;ve been hinting at for years!</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtU4tAaoDs8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>

					<description><![CDATA[There is nothing like a truly great villain.  Heroes are simple. You get the kitten out of the tree because it's the right thing to do.  But what kind of diabolical mind would even <em>think</em> to put the kitten there in the first place?

<p><strong><em>ANTON CHIGURH</em></strong> is no man.  He is a force of nature, a symbol.  Those who complained about a lack of resolution in the Coen brother’s 2007 best picture winner <em>No Country for Old Men</em> were missing something.  For Chigurh to have been killed or end up in prison would have been too pedestrian and, as an indestructible symbol of “all that dark and all that cold,” an impossibility.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4RnHsV3wIo" target="new">this scene in which Anton Chigurh locates Lewellyn Moss via a beacon planted in a bag of stolen money</a></p>
<p>It’s brilliantly executed. Chigurh is never seen but his presence is always felt (occasionally as a shotgun blast to a window!)  It further reinforces the sense that he is something more than human.</p>
<p>A rival hitman—expertly played by Woody Harrelson—tries to impress upon the film’s protagonist exactly who he’s dealing with:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“You don&#8217;t understand. You can&#8217;t make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he&#8217;d still kill you. He&#8217;s a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>These “principles” reflect the sort of existential indifference that permeates the film.  No one is safe.  Anton Chigurh is the embodiment of that theme, and his decision to end your life may come down to a simple toss of the coin.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-H1Buew8Qg" target="new">Call it.</a></p>

<p><em><strong>THE JOKER</strong></em> made his first appearance in 1940 and has arguably become the most recognizable villain in the Batman’s sizeable pantheon.  But it wasn’t until Alan Moore put his spin on the character in DC Comic’s <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em> in 1988 that the Joker finally reached his true potential.  Moore was the first writer to delve into the very nature of Batman and the Joker’s epic rivalry and its almost inevitable outcome.  It was also listed among the chief sources of inspiration for Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the character in 2008’s <em>The Dark Knight</em>.</p>
<p>Batman, at his best, is a character that exists on the fringe of insanity.  He is, after all, a man dressed as a bat.  The idea that Batman’s latent madness only attracts more of the same has never been more fully realized than in the Joker, who seeks only to strip the Bat of all he knows and loves and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohU16OiduUs" target="new">reveal that we are all just a step away from madness</a>.</p>
<p>So the Joker reminds Batman exactly how close he is to madness, but he also reminds him why he does what he does.  The two need each other.  They are what happens when “an unstoppable force meets an immovable object”, and they are “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dtFIjaD5hA" target="new">destined to do this forever</a>,&#8221; if we’re lucky.</p>

<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLAINVIEW</em></strong> of director Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2007 oil epic <em>There Will Be Blood</em> may not be a villain in the conventional sense, but that’s exactly what makes him so extraordinary.  True villainy is often committed with great certitude, and Daniel’s last name says it all.  There are no pretenses with Daniel.  His only desire is to get enough money so that he can “get away.”  Here is a man so filled with contempt for humanity that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Evz-Nuec_U" target="new">nearly every word that passes his lips oozes with venom</a>.</p>
<p>The center of the film is the rivalry between Daniel and a young preacher named Eli (seen in the above clip), whom Daniel views as the only real opposition in his attempt to control the town.  Theirs is a game of constant one-upmanship, culminating in the the pure madness of their final confrontation.</p>
<p>Daniel Day Lewis has created a genuine monster in Daniel Plainview, but there is an element of tragedy in his brief moments of humanity.  Take Daniel’s son, who eventually enters the family oil business.  Daniel cannot stand the thought that his son is going to move away and make something of himself on his own.  His reaction to the news is vile to be sure, but the reason behind it is heartbreaking.  Even great villains can be human.</p>

<p><em><strong>DETECTIVE ALONZO HARRIS</strong></em> of 2001’s <em>Training Day</em> is charismatic, funny and intelligent.  You get the feeling that there was a time when he was considered the baddest (Michael Jackson Bad) detective in the city.  Now he’s most certainly the baddest (like, actual bad) detective in the city, shirking his real duties for some gambling action, struttin’ and straight up thuggery.  Alonzo has become nothing more than a bully and it is Jake Hoyt’s (Ethan Hawke) bad luck that he happens to be assigned to ride along with him for his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGJ7Ct6LHs8" target="new">first day of training</a>.</p>
<p>Alonzo grins, jokes and intimidates his way through Hoyt’s first day, all the while executing a plan that doesn’t come into full view for us (and Hoyt) until nearly halfway through the movie.</p>
<p>There is also the scene where Alonzo meets with several other detectives.  They share some stories and some laughs, indicating that they were probably friends at one time.  But as the conversation moves along we realize that Alonzo has forsaken all friendships by now.  He is truly alone in the mess he’s created, and we all know how animals react when backed into a corner.</p>
<p><em>Training Day</em> relies almost completely on Denzel Washington’s larger-than-life performance, and it pays off.  If you don’t believe me, check out Washington in the scene below.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih9C2Pn0zwQ" target="new">Alonzo’s transition from cocky thug to frightened street punk</a> is about as perfect as you could ask for.</p>

<p>The 2001 british gangster film <em>Sexy Beast</em> is certainly well-written and well directed, but its real claim to fame is Ben Kingsley’s performance as <em><strong>DON LOGAN</strong></em>.  His introduction is pitch-perfect.  He marches through an airport like a scud missile aimed squarely at former ganster Gary “Gal” Dove’s new found happiness.</p>
<p>“Gal” has retired to Spain from a less-than-savory career in England’s seedy underworld.  He has been accompanied by a couple of friends and his wife, with whom he is still madly in love.  Things couldn’t be better until they receive news that Don Logan is coming for a visit.  Don has a job offer for “Gal” and he simply will not take no for an answer.</p>
