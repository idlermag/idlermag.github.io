										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beverages have represented different things to me at various times in my life, and I find that my drink preferences can be easily broken down into clearly defined eras, each with its own, distinctive needs. Those needs were not always satiated, but boy, it didn’t stop me from trying using whatever was sloshing around in my glass.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy damsel: the early years</strong></p>
<p>Like most children, I drank cows’ milk. But growing up in Wisconsin, the land of milk and cheese, I drank it constantly &#8212; with meals and in-between. I lived a stone’s-throw from a number of dairy farms, and my local high school ran a yearly “bring your tractor to school day” for the Future Farmers of America students. The dairy farm nearest to my home also had veal cows penned right up against the road, where everyone could see. I saw tethered, baby veal cows most days of my first eighteen years of life.</p>
<p>During my childhood and adolescence, rBGH &#8212; also known as &#8220;recombinant bovine growth hormone&#8221; &#8212; was plentiful, unregulated, and pumped into milk at a record rate. I was consuming a great ton of milk then, and now I have a milkmaid figure and endometriosis. Just kidding &#8212; I’m sure neither is related. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>A fish called Wanda: the boozy years</strong></p>
<p>I was already a few years into sewing my recreational oats via other substances when something as unremarkable as alcohol began subverting it&#8217;s way into my repertoire with increasing rotations. I accessed it by the typical, teenage avenues at my disposal because I was eighteen; an age sometimes quite crudely referred to as &#8220;not old enough to drink, but old enough to swallow.&#8221; Soon I was chasing the day when I&#8217;d be able to down liquor that was not stolen, swindled, or combined from the ends of other people&#8217;s discarded drinks. In the meantime, I decided that drinking something I had just picked cigarette butts out of was part of my charm, and became a scavenger-goat for alcohol &#8212; a remora and bottom-feeder feasting on the booze scraps that of-age sharks had lost track of or left behind. When I had a choice or had convinced some poor sod to buy the man’s-ruin-fluid on my behalf, I opted for Bud Light, leaving me more calories for food, or Mad Dog, leaving me more money for things like gasoline and film developing. (These were the days before digital cameras.) By the time I moved on to straight vodka, whiskey and rum, I was almost old enough to buy it myself.</p>
<p>Eventually the way that I was drinking became less endearingly ribald and more&#8230; abject. So now I buy alcohol only infrequently, and then opt for indie beer with fancy labels, like a good little hipster. Although I will say that <em>Idler</em> music columnist and good buddy Mike Vincent recently turned me on to Dogfish brand beer, which is a slice of beer-heaven.</p>
<p><strong>Working stiff: the retail years</strong></p>
<p>So. Much. Coffee. This is when espresso finally made it to the midwest, so in fueling my lowly bookstore-assistant-manager positions, I graduated from giant, refillable styrofoam McDonald’s coffees to caffeine-loaded froo-froo drinks that came in matte, brown cups with the little corrugated condom-jackets. Somewhere along the way I switched back to plain black coffee again which was 1.) free at the independent bookstore I finally ended up at, and 2.) low-calorie, to correspond with the eating disorder I had developed not long after I stopped drinking like a sad lounge-singer.</p>
<p>In mid-high school, putting sugar and cream in my truck stop coffee like a silly, innocent teenager had been part of the fun in drinking it while I sat across from my friend <a href="http://theprojekt.artsprojekt.com/post/7655866383/artist-proof-interview-with-artist-kelly" target="_blank">Kelly Howlett</a> (who is now a painter and teacher), agreeing that being part of a creative community like the Beats would be totally swell. Cream and sugar lost their allure around the same time food did, and even though I now eat like a regular lady, I never really regained my taste for sweetened coffee. I still like my coffee black and bitter like a punch in the face &#8212; a reminder of where I came from, and the things I was forced to abandon to survive. Leave me my bitter coffee, oh irresponsiblity and excess, for you have already robbed me of so much.   </p>
<p><strong>Today and tonight: the writing years</strong></p>
<p>The combination of a slipshod lifestyle, a slavish debt to old demons, inherited predispositions and a wussy constitution has left me with rather cry-baby adrenals at age 34. I still drink coffee, but it’s a dysfunctional relationship to encourage. If I drink it, I don’t sleep. In fact, it’s 7:45 a.m. as I write this, and I haven’t been to bed yet tonight (uh, this morning?). I even took a little Rx downer at midnight to help motivate me to become tired, but I’m afraid that’s worn off now since it’s only supposed to last about six hours. Staying up all night to work is all too tempting when it’s work you care about, and when the words are coming easily like a new lover who thinks you’re something special.</p>
<p>When I am being responsible, I drink tea. It’s the perfect balance to give me enough pep to avoid passing out into my soup like a blitzed Montgomery Clift, but not so much that I stay up until eight a.m. trying to write my way out of whatever box I imagine I’m in. Fortunately, I love tea. When I was writing my novel <em>Basajaun</em>, I would drink a pot of green tea steadily throughout the day, and it kept me literarily lubricated and balanced, yet muted enough to remain still and produce. I view green tea as magical writing elixir, but for it to function effectively, I have to go into the day fresh, having slept the night before. That’s the bit that’s the stickler. When it gives you temporary results, it’s all too easy to pump your body with delicious, face-punching black coffee all for the sake of accomplishing work or avoiding the night. For Winkin’, Blikin’ and Nod &#8212; those rogue denizens of sleep &#8212; may not be as friendly when you’re heavily caffeinated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re the first thing I think of in the morning. I’ve never smoked, but I imagine it’s a similar craving. Should I make a pot or run to the corner café? When my head is heavy with sinusitis, it’s impossible to lift it off the pillow.  On these days I need coffee to keep me from blowing my brains out.</p>
<p>If I drank the night before, I can mistake the dull throbbing for a hangover. But I rarely drink enough, unfortunately to be hung-over. If only I could drown my sorrows and my sniffles in enough Vicodin and very fine wine.</p>
<p>Gulp two extra-strength Tylenol from the bottle on the nightstand. When I wake up listening to the Pacific ocean in Mexico, I always feel better. It’s the sea air and the ability to blame tequila for whatever hurts.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine coffee life before Starbucks. When I travel to New York or Washington D.C., they feed my beast, quickly and conveniently. Here in the U.S., a four-shot, venti, vanilla latte is always around the next corner, never more than a few steps away.</p>
<p>When I lived in South America, it was Starbucks that I missed the most. It’s impossible to get a take-out coffee to save your life in Argentina or Brazil. In Buenos Aires, if you ask at a café for a coffee “para llevar”, that is, “to go”, they squint their eyes and give you a very funny look.</p>
<p>“To go? But why? Relax, sit down, take an espresso and then go to work. It can wait. ”</p>
<p>There is no driving and drinking in Latin America. Coffee that is. Only a foreigner would think about walking down the street with a paper cup full of espresso.</p>
<p>When I order my four-shot drink in Chicago, sometimes iced in warm weather, the baristas do a double-take. “Are you ok?” they ask. “Whole milk? Are you sure?”</p>
<p><em>Really</em>…If I order four shots of espresso, cut with a double dose of vanilla syrup, do you really think I give a flying tomato about fat calories?</p>
<p>Every once and a while I try to cut down. I hear caffeine is bad for women in all sorts of ways. But I’ve been drinking coffee since I was ten or eleven. My grandmother served it as a warmer-upper when we stayed over, in brown melamine teacups.  My mother fed it to all six of us before school on cold mornings.</p>
<p>The electric coffeepot is always perking at my parents’ house, even though now, because of my father’s heart, they drink decaf.  A percolator keeps the coffee hotter than a drip coffeemaker. And we always drink our coffee with half and half.  I just can’t stomach it with milk or, god-forbid, 2% or skim. My sister takes her coffee with Equal, a bow to a diet of sorts, but good old regular sugar is still my vice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I drink too much on an empty stomach at the office, my knees start twitching uncontrollably under my desk. But the absence of coffee in my life feels like an absent lover. My head aches, my limbs go limp, and I crave, too much, a pillow and my blanket to hide from the sunrise.</p>
