										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignright" title="The Artist poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/the-artist-poster-wins__oPt.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="324" />The Artist</em> is a much cheekier film than I had expected going in, because as much as it strives for (and attains) authenticity it also spends a good deal of time winking at those who don’t like (or at least think they don’t like) silent films.</p>
<p>Its story is a sort of mash-up of <em>Singing in the rain</em> (1952) and <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> (1950) &#8212; the first being a film about the inception of the “talkie” and a young starlet who makes it big because she has a better voice than the current big name (a less squeaky one, at least), and the latter being about a washed-up silent film star left behind by her former industry to go mad in solitude. Admittedly, <em>The Artist</em> functions much better when it’s closer to the former, but the winks help with the latter.</p>
<p>These “winks” that I keep mentioning mostly come in the form of melodrama, especially towards the end, which gets to be a bit. . . much. But there are also a few clever uses of sound here and there. Hearing Jean Dujardin’s thick, French accent at the film&#8217;s end is especially fun.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dujardin, the casting is phenomenal. None of the actors, even the highly recognizable ones (John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, James Cromwell), feel out of place. But man, does Dujardin look at home in black and white! Roger Ebert described him as a cross between Sean Connery and Gene Kelly, which is pretty apropos. Berenice Bejo as the plucky young Peppy Miller doesn’t do half bad herself, with her winning smile and perfectly placed (by Dujardin, in fact) beauty mark.</p>
<p>So the order for the day here seems to be charm. There isn’t a second of <em>The Artist</em> that isn’t charming in one way or another. But can a film win a Best Picture Oscar on charm alone?</p>
<p><strong>The Artist<em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin), Best Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo), Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Costume Design, Best Directing, Best Editing, Music (original score) &amp; Best original Screenplay</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Toy Story 3 poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.pixartoystory.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/poster-toy-story-3.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="349" />Pixar is money, pure and simple. They have raised the bar on the animated film, having mastered the ability to engage a child while still holding the interest of an adult. The <em>Toy Story</em> series has always been pretty kid-centric but not without its mature themes. <em>Toy Story 3</em> heads into infinity and almost beyond adult territory (No, not THAT adult territory), with emphasis on themes like growing up, life changes and even dictatorship. Don’t worry; the cute toys are still there. I did say almost.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the series will remember Andy, owner of Woody the cowboy (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear the action figure (Tim Allen) amongst a great many other toys. In the original <em>Toy Story</em>, Woody and Buzz battled each other for the honor of being the most favored among all of Andy’s toys. In <em>Toy Story 2</em>, Buzz and Woody started to face the idea that the day will come when Andy will no longer needs them. In <em>Toy Story 3</em>, that day has come. Andy’s off to college.</p>
<p>I was struck by how much of this film was actually kind of a downer. This isn’t a criticism necessarily; it’s just that this may leave some kids wanting. Things go from being sad to downright bleak as the toys vacillate between the idea of either being in toy limbo (the attic) or toy hell (the dump). They think they’ve gotten lucky when they end up donated to a daycare facility. Instead, they discover that they’re in toy Uganda. The Pixar crew does eventually bring things back around to provide a sweet, tear-jerking ending and a fitting finale for the series as a whole, but still.</p>
<p>I am a sucker for Pixar’s films. If their name is on it, odds are it&#8217;s worth seeing. <em>Toy Story 3</em> is no exception, but I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that this wasn’t one of my favorites. It’s very, very good, but I think I’d still take either of the first two over this one. A strong argument could be made that this film was nominated for Best Picture simply because <em>Wall-E</em> and <em>Up</em> probably should have been in the years prior. Odds are it won’t win both Best Picture and Best Animated Feature, so if I had to guess I’d say it’s more likely to take the later. That being said, <em>The Illusionist</em> might sneak away with that one. Could this be the first year in a good long while that we can no longer refer to the Best Animated Feature award as the Best Pixar Award?</p>
<p><strong>Toy Story 3 <em>is nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature Film, Best Music (Original Song), Best Sound Editing &amp; Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Black Swan poster" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.onlinemovieshut.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/black-swan-movie-poster.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="342" />It’s wet, cold and icy and I’m on my way to the Main Art Theatre in Royal Oak to see <em>Black Swan</em>. I shouldn’t be out, but there are ten friggin’ best picture nominees and I’ve got to get rolling. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow.</p>
<p>I shake off the cold (and the rage I feel when a single droplet of ice water crashes down onto my head, seemingly piercing my skull and trickling down my spine, leaving behind an icy cold pain in its wake) and meet a friend of mine in the lobby. She’s my go-to companion for these types of art house films because they depress my wife.</p>
<p>Sometimes a film hits you differently when you’re in a mood, and it turns out that the tension of my drive in, the icy cold and my run in with that water droplet scud missile might have put me in the perfect frame of mind for Darren Aronovsky’s hyper-tense, psycho-sexual ballet thriller. Now <em>that’s</em> a subgenre!</p>
<p><em>Black Swan</em> tells the story of Nina (Natalie Portman), a young ballerina vying for the dual lead role in Tchaikovsky’s <em>Swan</em><em> Lake</em><em> </em>as both the white and black swan. Her instructor, Thomas Leroy, played with lecherous arrogance by Vincent Cassel, informs her that while she is perfect for the demure, trepedatious white swan, her inhibitions keeps her from perfecting the freer spirited black swan. He seems more than willing to give her some tips on how she might lighten up (wink wink). What a guy.</p>
<p>Soon, a dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis) begins to move from Nina’s peripheral to her cross hairs as her only real rival for the part of the black swan. Lily, it seems, is exactly the kind of undisciplined, highly sexual dancer Leroy is looking for. Too repressed to start hair pulling and name calling, Nina begins to hallucinate. Or does she?</p>
<p>The true success of <em>Black Swan</em> lies in Aronovsky and Portman’s commitment to its madness. The story (and Nina) is clearly a bit over-the-top, but Portman’s performance is fearless. Her Nina is the epitome of fragility. She is tightly wound, a staunch perfectionist in her movements, always appearing to be on the verge on tears. Her decent into madness isn’t so much a steady decline as a dash down Splash Mountain. Aronovsky keeps us in her head with tight close ups, a camera that almost never strays from Nina and a ramped up soundtrack (Seriously, everything from her footsteps to her breathing, as well as a few more unpleasant sounds, is palpable).</p>
<p>The film heads where it heads with no detours and it relies on the viewer’s willingness to take the ride. The minute you begin to question it, <em>Black Swan’s</em> lost you. It is big. It is melodramatic. But so is ballet and, more to point, that’s how Nina perceives it. This is not about a role; it’s about life and death.</p>
<p><strong>Black Swan <em>is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress in a leading role (Natalie Portman), Best Cinematography (Matthew Libatique) &amp; Best Director (Darren Aronovsky)</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Winter's Bone poster" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/wintersboneposter.jpg?w=238&#038;h=353" alt="" width="238" height="353" />As big a fan of the movie theatre experience as I am, I must admit that some films really are best viewed at home, curled up under a blanket in the dark. There is something about that level of intimacy that allows a film to really envelop you before truly sinking in. <em>Winter’s Bone</em> is such a film.</p>
<p>Its story is set in the Ozark Mountains. The place and people seem lost in time, or forgotten by it. Their environment is not unlike that of a post-apocalyptic waste land, its trees barren, its landscape littered with debris and abandoned trailers.</p>
<p>Somewhere, somehow, tucked away from the rest of the world 17-year-old Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) has learned how to take care of herself, her two younger siblings, and her mentally disconnected mother. She is ignorant, but not unintelligent. She is the survivor most of us are lucky enough to never have to be. There is a quiet confidence about her and we wonder where that might have come from. She has dignity as well, telling her younger brother “don’t ask for what oughta be offered.”</p>
<p>One day the Sheriff arrives and tells Ree that her meth-dealing father has put up their family home on bond. If he doesn’t make his court date, the state will take it from them. For Ree there isn’t a moment of doubt. She says she’ll find him, alive or dead. Probably dead.</p>
<p>She comes across many people in her search, no small amount of them related to her. Here is an area ripe for caricature, but director Debra Granik never crosses that line. There are some lines that hint at inbreeding, others that speak pretty directly to it, but it’s never used for shock value. It is what it is.</p>
<p>One major figure in Ree’s life is her uncle Teardrop (Probably not his proper, Christian name. Although, maybe?), played by the excellent character actor John Hawkes. He is a hard-edged, distrustful drug addict, and yet he seems to have real affection for his niece, if not respect. And while Ree’s journey may lead her to some sort of catharsis, Teardrop’s is one of near-Shakespearian tragedy. His final line is a heavy one.</p>
<p><em>Winter’s Bone</em> sneaks up on you. It snuck up on me. The more I watched Ree try to save her home, trusting people to do the right thing, being disappointed in them when they didn’t and moving forward regardless, the more I felt the weight of the film. It’s quiet in every sense, but unflinching. It’s also the kind of film that deserves the praise it’s getting, but is probably too subtle to get over the hump. Time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>Winter’s Bone <em>is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor in a supporting role (John Hawkes), Best Actress in a leading role (Jennifer Lawrence) &amp; Best Adapted Screenplay</em></strong></p>
