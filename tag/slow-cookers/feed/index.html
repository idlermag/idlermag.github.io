										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I loved the chili that I made in my slow-cooker so much that I wanted to give the slow-cooker another try. I wanted to do a roast or some sort of chicken, but, as usual, I ended up choosing a soup. There’s nothing else like soup when the temperature drops below thirty and when you don’t feel like doing anything but curling up under a blanket with something warm. Another perk for me, since I bring lunch to work almost every day, is that soup reheats and travels well. And yet another, which I seriously cannot mention enough, is that I have dinner for days. I think I may have mentioned before how lazy I am.</p>
<p>I stumbled across <a href="http://crockpot365.blogspot.com/2009/06/crockpot-baked-potato-soup-recipe.html">this recipe</a> from a blog by Stephanie O’Dea, who made a New Year’s resolution back in 2008 to use her slow cooker every day. I ended up choosing a potato soup topped with bacon. I’m of the opinion that bacon makes anything better. When I was apartment-hunting, I met a girl who called bacon the candy of meats, and now that’s become a term my family uses regularly.</p>
<p>I used to make a potato carrot cheese soup, but it takes me about 4 hours and much more counter space than I have in my current apartment. It will take weeks for me to muster the energy for that soup. This soup, however, was easy. The trouble with using my slow-cooker is that I have to get up early and at least put the ingredients in. Getting up early to do that means I couldn’t go to the gym in the morning, because there&#8217;s no way I was going to wake up even earlier. So the plan was to go to the gym after work. But, I worried that by the time I got home the stuff in the slow-cooker would have been overcooked into mush or somehow have caught on fire and burned the house down.</p>
<p>Then I decided to stop being an idiot and set my alarm, and go to the gym another day. The recipe was simple&mdash;diced potatoes, minced garlic, salt, pepper, chili seasoning, and then add cream cheese after the rest was done cooking. (It was supposed to have an onion, but I no longer trust the internet on the subject of onions and decided to leave it out.) When my alarm went off in the morning, I jumped up, ready to feel all domestic. Half an hour was more than enough time to chop up some potatoes and garlic, right?</p>
<p>WRONG. In my excitement I’d forgotten a crucial step&mdash;washing and peeling the potatoes. Well, “forgotten” isn’t the right word. I’d just forgotten how long that can take. A half-asleep perfectionist trying to peel and dice potatoes in the morning is a terrible, terrible idea. I was even trying to dice them in a fancy way, after all the peeling, by cutting four edges off the potato to make it a square, then cutting long strips (but holding them together), flipping the potato two more times and cutting. <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC8kNBhUU28">This</a> is a super fast way of dicing, but it’s also dangerous. At one point I was cutting lazily, probably falling back asleep, when I felt a hard nub with my knife. <em>What’s that?</em> I thought. And then OH MY GOD I realized it was my finger (thankfully, before I kept cutting). I hear real cooks talking about knife skills, and even though it always sounds a little homicidal to me, I’m thinking maybe it’s something I should look into.</p>

I should mention that I was halving the recipe, since it was meant for a 6-quart slow cooker, and mine is only 4 quarts. I was rereading the recipe once everything was in the slow cooker, making sure I hadn’t forgotten anything, and I realized that I hadn’t actually halved the pepper. But, it’s just a flavoring, right? It would be fine. I put the lid on, turned it on low, and left only 10 minutes late&mdash;the pepper was a worthy price to pay for not being super late.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to leave work until almost 6, so I worried and worried that I was going to come home to a host of fire trucks. But when I got there, the potatoes looked perfect and it smelled peppery and delicious. I mashed up the potatoes so the soup was smooth, and added in the cream cheese. I used Neufchâtel cheese instead of cream cheese to reduce the fat content a little bit. But then, I cooked up some bacon to crumble on top, totally negating any worries about fat and worries about whether the soup would be tasty or not.</p>

(The recipe says I should’ve crumbled the cheese in, but how the hell do you crumble cream cheese?) Eventually, it was smooth and mixed, and I poured a bowl for myself, bacon included.</p>
<p>Pepper, as it turns out, is not a spice to fuck around with. It was spicy. I rather liked it, but any more pepper and it probably would have been inedible. However, I’ll be eating bacon for days, and that can only mean good things.</p>

This isn&#039;t it, but it looks kind of like this.</p></div> Last Christmas, I received a slow-cooker as a gift. For someone as lazy as me, it was an ideal gift&mdash;I could dump a lot of ingredients into the pot for a few hours and come back with a cooked meal. Easy success. When I moved to Boston in January, I took the slow-cooker with me. It sat on the bottom of my closet for months while I attempted to get my life together. It was always the next month when I was going to cook with it, and then it was summer and hot soups didn’t sound so great anymore.</p>
<p>Now that it’s December, I decided to finally try my first slow-cooker recipe so it wouldn’t go a year without being used, sitting sadly on the bottom of our kitchen cabinet. I found a recipe for <a target="new" href="http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/three-bean-turkey-chili-56214.aspx">Three Bean Turkey Chili</a>. I originally wanted to try a white chicken chili, but I chose this one because I’m trying to save money and most of the ingredients are canned. Sometimes, money-saving -&gt; fancy cooking. Sometimes.</p>
<p>I’d never cooked with ground turkey before, but I know it’s healthier than beef, and whenever my roommate makes turkey burgers I want to steal a bite when she turns her back. The only thing that needed to be prepared ahead of time was the turkey, so I got really ambitious and aimed to get up before work, cook the turkey, and put all the ingredients in the slow-cooker to be ready when I got home from work.</p>
<p>Well, that didn’t last when the alarm clock went off on Friday morning. I rolled over and went back to sleep, and decided to save it for the weekend. It turned out to be a great decision, considering what happened on Saturday. </p>
<p>Around 1 in the afternoon, I lined up all the cans of beans I needed (black, kidney, and northern) on the counter and started cooking the turkey. When it was done, I went to get out the slow cooker out of its hiding place, and had to wipe <em>dust</em> off the top of the box. I dumped the contents out on my bed and picked up the User’s Guide. I’m the kind of person who actually reads them.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the slow-cooker needed a fair amount of babying to be ready for use. I had to wash the pot, and wipe the outer part with a damp cloth. Then let it dry. <em>Then</em> I had to pour in two cups of water and let it simmer on high for twenty minutes. Then let it cool. Then rinse the pot out. Then let it dry. By the time I was done with all the prep, I thought about putting the thing away for another year. But then I’d have to start all over.</p>
<p>By this time, the cooked turkey had been sitting out for awhile, and the entire process of cooking the chili began to seem unappetizing. What do you mean, I need to wait four hours for dinner? (I had originally planned on cooking it on low for about 6 hours, but by the time it was all ready to go, I knew I’d waste away with hunger before then). I dumped the turkey into the pot, and opened all the cans. Did you know the beans had to be rinsed? I learn new things about cooking every day. </p>
<p>Then I reread the recipe. One can (48 oz) of diced tomatoes. I had put in one can (14 oz). I was still in my pajamas. I thought about just going with it, but since the recipe didn’t contain a lot of liquid and said to use the undrained tomatoes, I didn’t want to skimp and risk burning it all. Leaving the kitchen a mess of cans, I put on tennis shoes and huffily walked to the grocery store. Yet another lesson&mdash;read the recipe carefully. As I stomped through the store, I had a moment of gratitude that I hadn’t decided to do this in the morning. Walking to the grocery store at 7a.m. was much less appealing than 3 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>After adding the rest of the tomatoes, I put the lid on and turned the crockpot on high. The glass lid fogged up, which was cruel for someone cooking in it for the first time. I was dying to see what’s going on in there, or if anything had caught on fire. But since the users’ guide was very specific about NOT lifting the lid, and because I’m the sort of person who listens to users’ guides, I resisted temptation.</p>
<p><em>Two hours later. . .</em> </p>
<p>My apartment smelled like my grandparents’ house. And that’s a good thing&mdash;my grandma is a phenomenal cook. Every Christmas, we have a soup dinner where she makes three different kinds of soup. Chili is always one of them, along with her often-requested noodle soup. The table is full of crackers and cheeses for topping. Everyone has at least three bowls.</p>
<p><em>Four hours later. . .</em></p>
<p>This chili should be called “Three Hundred Tomato Chili.” I’ve always had trouble with the texture of tomatoes, and I’ve only recently started being able to tolerate fresh tomatoes. I feel like all recipes should indicate the tomato-chunk to other ingredient ratio. Not everyone can love slimy, crunchy chunks of tomato.</p>
<p>However, the chili turned out quite nicely, with just the right amount of spice. The best part&mdash;I won’t have to cook anything for a week, at least. And I only had to clean one dish when I was done.</p>
