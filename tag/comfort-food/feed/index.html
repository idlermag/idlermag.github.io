										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My grandfather wouldn&#8217;t eat garlic. While my family has produced a number of picky eaters, I don&#8217;t normally think of my grandfather as having been one of them. I don&#8217;t remember running into many things that he wouldn&#8217;t eat, although that may be been one of the privileges of eating mostly at one&#8217;s own house and being choosy about where one eats out. I ate a lot of good food with my grandfather, but no garlic.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast to the food I eat with my wife&#8217;s Italian family. When I was a child, pasta sauce was something that came from a jar and was poured over ground beef and noodles. My wife makes her own sauce, sometimes with fresh tomatoes and sometimes with canned, but always, always with fresh garlic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being a picky eater and being a food snob. I&#8217;d like to suggest that in the right hands garlic can sometimes bridge the two. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to do garlic bread. Even a quick search turns up recipes from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Rachel Ray</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/zesty-roasted-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Paula Deen</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Ina Garten</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/herbed-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Tyler Florence</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/guy-fieri/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Guy Fieri</a>, <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-2734" target="_blank">Bon Appétit</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-106583" target="_blank">Gourmet</a></em>. A lot of these involve quantities of cheese, herbs, tomatoes, or some combination of the above, and they&#8217;re all fine.</p>
<p>But as much as I love fresh garlic &#8212; and I do &#8212; garlic powder makes a perfectly good garlic bread. Take any loaf of unsliced crusty bread and cut it in half. Spread butter over both halves. Sprinkle garlic powder on the butter &#8212; a little goes a long way &#8212; and toast both halves under the broiler just until it starts to brown. Share if necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not anything that I would eaten in my grandfather&#8217;s house, but I think of him every time I eat it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everywhere I go, I&#8217;m finding macaroni and cheese. Family restaurants like Max and Erma&#8217;s have added it to the menu. For a while, Burger King was offering Kraft mac &amp; cheese as an option in its kid&#8217;s meals. It&#8217;s become the go-to when my wife and I take the girls out to dinner, and it&#8217;s my older daughter&#8217;s all-time favorite food. Everybody&#8217;s happy, everybody wins, right?</p>
<p>This past weekend, the family and I had dinner with my sister-in-law and her husband at a &#8220;bar and grille&#8221; in Madison, New Jersey. Any place the adds an &#8220;e&#8221; to the word grill clearly takes its menu seriously, and one of the entrees was an &#8220;adult&#8221; mac and cheese. While &#8220;a luscious aged cheddar and American cheese blend, baked with a scallion breadcrumb crust and a touch of brandy&#8221; sounded tempting to me, my daughter &#8212; the m&amp;c expert &#8212; doesn&#8217;t like her mac and cheese to be too fussy. Mushrooms? Onions? A Ritz cracker crust? She&#8217;s out. The kid&#8217;s menu included &#8220;mac&#8217;n cheese&#8221; without any additional description, so we crossed our fingers when both the girls ordered it.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, when the kid&#8217;s &#8220;mac&#8217;n cheese&#8221; arrived, it was a bunch of elbow noodles swimming in Velveeta. The girls wouldn&#8217;t touch it. I was severely annoyed and just a little proud. (They ended up sharing my burger, which looked like it was good.)</p>
<p>So last night, to make up for it, we made a batch of our own mac and cheese at home. It&#8217;s pretty basic, but worth sharing as an alternative to the standard boxed version. Not that the salty, tangy, powdered cheese substitute variety doesn&#8217;t have its appeal, but just a little bit of effort can give you noodles swimming in a gorgeous, golden, sharp cheddar sauce.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by melting the butter over low heat, and then add the flour. It&#8217;ll start off looking like this:</p>

<p>And as the magic happens, it&#8217;ll start looking like this:</p>

<p>As many of you know, what you&#8217;re doing is making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux" target="_blank">roux</a>, where the flour particles form an emulsion in the butter fat and act as the base for your eventual cheese sauce. As anyone who has watched a Velveeta commercial knows, while cheddar tastes awesome, when it melts it gets kind of oily. Thus the sauce rather than just melting a block of cheddar over the noodles. (Which would actually taste fine, if you don&#8217;t mind the oil.)</p>
<p>(If you want to stretch a little bit, you can continue to heat the roux a minute or two before moving on to the next step. It&#8217;ll toast the flour, giving you a darker roux and a slightly nutty flavor to your final mac and cheese.)</p>
<p>Add the milk and salt to your roux, and melt the cheese into the sauce, adding a little at a time. Pro tip: those packages of pre-shredded cheese you can find in the supermarket are generally exactly two cups (8 ounces). If you&#8217;re like me and pull the package straight from the freezer, you can raise the heat to medium. Stir until all the cheese has melted. It&#8217;ll be a golden pot of cheesy awesomeness to make Velveeta curl up with envy, and it&#8217;ll look something like this:</p>

<p>Boil the noodles while you&#8217;re making the sauce. When both are done, stir together in an oven-safe casserole dish. When we&#8217;re in a hurry, we&#8217;ll serve the mac and cheese just like this.</p>

<p>The girls have never complained, but I&#8217;m much happier when we throw the mixture into a 350-degree oven for 20-25 minutes, and it comes out looking something like this:</p>

<p>Most of the &#8220;adult&#8221; restaurant mac and cheeses you&#8217;ll find will have some sort of a breadcrumb crust, which is wonderful, but even just the cheese sauce by itself will give you a nice, tasty crust after baking. (If you prefer a creamier mac and cheese, you can double the milk in the sauce to two cups.)</p>
<p>And now you&#8217;re ready to experiment! Mushrooms! Jalepeños! More cheese! But even without all that, you have a wonderful, rich, cheesy macaroni and cheese. Even better, so long as you&#8217;re not feeding a group, you&#8217;ll have leftovers waiting for you any time need a warm plate of comfort food.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for your patience while I took a week off, dear readers. I rarely get sick but I caught some sort of sinus illness that started off as a fever that had me shivering violently at my desk and coughing up several lungs. I drugged myself up and went to work because I had plans to travel for a bachelorette party and if sickness tried to stop me, I was not having that shit. I woke up each morning and double-fisted a glass of water and a glass of orange juice to swallow my pills. But by the time I got home each day, I put on three sweaters and a blanket and made a beeline for my bed. I could barely make myself go to the sink to get more water to take more drugs. But I needed some food. After having traveled the weekend before, I had nothing in my pantry but Arborio rice and stale tortilla chips. I waited for the drugs to kick in, and then dragged my ass to the grocery store in my sweatpants and flip flops, my hair looking all kinds of great.</p>
<p>I stumbled around the grocery store with my basket on my arm, gathering everything I needed for an extended stay in my bed. More drugs (the good kind—the kind you now have to show your ID to get because people use them to make meth), more Kleenex, cough drops, orange juice, and chicken ‘n’ stars soup. I’m a major devotee of orange juice’s healing powers—when I load up on Vitamin C, I tend to avoid getting sick if I feel it coming on; or if I do get sick, I don’t get as sick and I don’t stay sick for as long. It probably would have been smart to pick up some Gatorade or something with electrolytes or less than one million grams of sodium, but I turn into sort of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXLHWmjA5IE">child</a> when I’m sick. There’s nothing quite like condensed saltwater with some mushy star-shaped noodles to make you a little saltier and happier than before.</p>

<p>One of my roommates offered to make me Jello, and, like a complete moron, I refused. Even though I was moaning my way around the apartment, wrapped in a blanket, I wanted to keep up a front of strength. Sickness cannot defeat me! Jell-O is for squares and kids! But as I coughed my way back toward my bedroom, I changed my mind. “Actually,” I croaked, “Jell-O sounds great.” The best part about being sick is that you can get people to do things for you without having to feel guilty. You <em>deserve</em> that Jello and foot massage, you poor thing. My roommate found the Jell-O, and handed it to me. “Here you go!” she said. As it turns out, I didn’t really want the Jell-O. I wanted someone to make it for me.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, my mom had her own cure for a cold. We called it Jell-O water. She’d go through all the steps of making Jell-O except for letting it solidify. She’d pour the hot drink into a cup with a straw and I could drink it while I laid on the couch and watched <em>Lamb Chop’s Play-Along</em> and <em>Wishbone</em> reruns. It was a kid-friendly version of tea and its effects were mostly placebo, but sometimes I’d cough just a little more than was necessary in order to get good and sugared up and best of all, to have my mom make it for me and bring it to me.  Only recently did it occur to me that Jell-O water isn’t something that everyone drank and that it may or may not be really strange.</p>
<p>What are your best sick foods? Do you have any weird ones like my Jell-O water?</p>
