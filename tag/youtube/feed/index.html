										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello again. I’ve been gone, now I’m back. (No that’s not a Morrissey song lyric nor is it a mission statement.) In-between coming to grips with the end of my teaching year and a strange newfound interest in planting seeds in the ground and watching them grow, music has felt very far from my mind. I felt a bit of creative juice over the weekend and saw a few YouTube videos that stirred up a bit of fire in my belly.<br />
Normally I’m not a fan of the all YouTube posts but I think that can be more effective than my own clunky prose and self-pitying reflection. A note, all of the videos come from Germany.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Between the Eyes&#8221;</strong>&mdash;Amon Düül 2</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSAk1O0B6sg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>An early Krautrock track that features some nice, heavy, <em>sturm und drang</em>. The term Krautrock tends to conjur up the electronic end of the German spectrum in the 1970s and hearing this hairy, <em>Deutche</em> hippies rock out at the turn of the 70s turns that thought on its ear.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;It’s A Rany Day (Sunshine Girl)&#8221;</strong>&mdash;Faust</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRxvQmTTz5I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Less of a song than a mantra. Oodles of little things in the mix that one really needs headphones (earbuds?) to appreciate. From the tribal drums to the deep &#8220;bawoom&#8221; to the undertones and swirls of color midway through the song and finally the completely not out of context harmonica solo and the closing saxophone bleat. A fantastic song, another to push the edge of one’s definition of Krautrock.</p>
<p>&#8220;De Luxe (Immer Wieder)&#8221;&mdash;Harmonia. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9IXXGxKDtqU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The Krautrock supergroup! (übergruppe?) Harmonia. Formed with two members of the band Cluster and the always dashing Michael Roether of Neu!, who joined with the Culter folks after putting his own band on hold. When Neu! broke up in 1975 there was Harmonia (and La Dusselforf, which is the group formed by the other half of Neu!, Klaus Dinger) and there was a great, short body of work that came from the group. This song, &#8220;Deluxe (Immer Weider)&#8221;_mdash:literally &#8220;again and again&#8221; or &#8220;over and over&#8221;&mdash;is the title track from the LP of the same name in 1975. As with a LP by the group Can the following year the song would have a faster, more engaging reprise at the end of side one. A masterpiece of music and a fantastic LP.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Paperhouse&#8221;</strong>&mdash;Can</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QLL2j8ZtxE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>A band that I am incredibly familiar with; I have absorbed their music like air for many years. In this clip we see the second incarnation of the band, with Japanese shrieker Damo Suzuki at the mic. What is remarkable about this clip is the interplay of the players, from Michael Karoli on guitar, Holger Czukay on bass, Irmin Schimdt on keys, and most impressively Jaki Leibezeit on drums. The song shift that starts at 2:52 into the song, as Karoli fades into the mix before coming back up playing a rhythmic lead and the power behind the shift is all due to Leibeziet. And the shot of the drummer in profile, looking around at the rest of his rhythm section is amazing. Listening to that song you get a sense of how powerful the band was live. Seeking out their <em>Can DVD</em> from 1997 gives you the chance to see their legendary live show in Cologne, Germany in 1972. They give the impression of being a rigid, humourless band. That is. . .</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;I Want More&#8221;</strong>&mdash;Can</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0nfjguTclg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Ok. Yes this is <em>Top Of the Pops</em> and they are lip syncing. AND it looks like Lou Reed is in the band rather than Michael Karoli, but this song, from 1976’s aquatic <em>Flow Motion</em> is just a pure attempt to get a hit. And boy, what a hit. The song opened side one of the LP and another track, simply entitled &#8220;. . . and More&#8221; closed side one. I love them both equally. Can’s humor, a trait we don’t generally assign to Germans, would pop up a few years later on their final LP of the 70s, the easily titled LP <em>Can</em>. As the latest in their ongoing project of “Ethnological Forgery Series,” where the band would invent musical genres is the track titled &#8220;EFS #99&#8221; which when you listen to it is the GREATEST version of Offenbach’s cancan dance in the world. There used to be a clip of the band miming the song in the 70s which has sadly gone off YouTube.</p>
<p>I found a great number of Kraftewerk clips in my journey here and I will be writing about these clips, and the evolution of the band visually next week. Stay tuned!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for an excuse to check your email one more time before bed? Or maybe you’re just up late answering the siren song of the interwebs while you worry about loved ones, career, or the eternal blackness. Whatever the reason you’re sitting at your comp when you should totally be sleeping, here are some of my favorite funny ‘cheer up’ links on YouTube that I go to for distraction on those nights when real solutions just don’t cut it. </p>
<p>#10.  <strong>Good luck to you and your cocka’roach</strong><br />
The 3 1/2 minute short &#8220;The Critic&#8221; (1963) is the first film ever by Mel Brooks. Brooks dons his 2000 Year Old Man-ish voice to challenge the artsy, ambiguous animated short he (and we) are watching, with a voice-over filled with hilarious, bewildered old-man anger and skepticism. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/otPkk1sUFkI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#9.  <strong>The double nerdery</strong><br />
I try not to throw the word ‘brilliant’ around, but this fan-made video of classic <em>Star Trek</em> clips set to the tune of &#8220;Knights of the Round Table&#8221; from <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> is brilliant. And with the potential crossover of Star Trek and Python fans, it’s a delight to nerds on multiple levels. I also believe that it is the best-edited fanvid ever in the history of YouTube. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/luVjkTEIoJc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#8.  <strong>The best <em>MST3K</em> short</strong><br />
Poking fun at 1950s mores is like shooting fish in a barrel, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t funny! With its squeaky clean, creepy-wholesomeness, ‘Mr. B. Natural’ (1956) would be funny even without the great <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> commentary. Whoever concocted this was obviously going for a Mary-Martin-as-Peter-Pan vibe in selecting a buoyant, short-haired actress to play a character who is referred to as male. Like Peter Pan, Mr. B Natural swoops into the isolated bedroom of an impressionable adolescent boy. Unlike Peter Pan, Mr. B doesn’t seem like anything but an abrasive, frisky 34-year-old woman. Double entendres abound. Oh, 1950s—you slay me. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8kH4XyWjq4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>(For PART TWO, click <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfuQMBYNRv0">here</a>)</p>
<p>#7.  <strong>The Guilty Pleasure</strong><br />
The Army of Lovers &#8220;Crucified&#8221; video (1991) intentionally turns the theatrically-grandiose dial past bombastic to just silly. Never have three musicians done such fun, tongue-in-cheek pretentiousness so well. The Swedish band is an equal-opportunity employer too, as the effect of La Camilla’s huge lips, Bo-Peep cleavage and crotch-flower combined with Jean-Pierre Barda’s hairy straitjacket bondage and posey-pouch could really turn anyone to almost anything.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EdooYar_A6g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#6.  <strong>Marcel the Shell</strong><br />
Stop-animation shell talks in a funny baby voice about how tiny he is, and about how various household items and day-to-day events impact his tininess. Awwww. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VF9-sEbqDvU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#5.  <strong>The Happy Dance</strong><br />
You may recognize this Bollywood video from the opening of the film <em>Ghost World</em>. &#8220;Jaan Pehechaan Ho&#8221; originated in the 1965 Indian thriller <em>Gumnaam</em>, although the indescribable dance number and song by famous Indian singer Mohammed Rafi (the voice in the video but not the actor shown singing) is actually much more well-known now than the movie. Like Cartman singing &#8220;Come Sail Away,&#8221; once I begin watching this video, I cannot stop it at any point until it’s over. I also once made a custom <em>SoulCalibur</em> character that I patterned after dancer Laxmi Chhaya in her gold dress and thief mask. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnBbjc5hmho?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#4.  <strong>Tarzan lived in up a great big tree</strong><br />
On New Year&#8217;s Day, some friends and I were talking about out favorite Hal Roach &#8220;Our Gang&#8221; shorts and the 1933 short &#8220;Forgotten Babies&#8221;—where Spanky McFarland is coerced by the older kids to babysit a bunch of toddlers barely younger than himself—came up immediately. It’s from the baby-Spanky era, where directors presumably gave the little tyke some general topic nudging and then just let him ramble, with unforgettable results. The &#8220;Tarzan&#8221; story here is one of many great Spanky moments. A bunch of us also once agreed that it’s kind of similar to Dougal’s (Ardal O’Hanlon) <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP0NkL-QfvE">rant about The Beast</a> in <em>Father Ted</em>, except that Spanky doesn’t say Tarzan sounds like Liam Neeson chasing a load of hens around inside a barrel.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFXAdxdym68?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#3. <strong>Fun With God</strong><br />
Tony Millionaire, creator of the <em>Sock Monkey</em> comic and <em>Maakies</em> strip, is one of my very, very favorite illustrators. His work is all at once funny, sad, raunchy and so exquisitely rendered. Interviews and <a target="new" href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Tony-Millionaire/dp/1595821589">The Art of Tony Millionaire</a> book allude to the artist’s colorful life, and to add to his mystique, Millionaire occasionally pops up in small acting spots like this one, where he plays God. I don’t know who’s playing the role of the wine-drinker, but the whole sketch is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. Not safe for work, due to Millionaire’s hilarious and ribald swearing.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zERQmic3JJ8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#2.  <strong>The best bunny video, chosen entirely through nepotism</strong><br />
This is a video I made of my pet rabbit. It’s very cheeky of me to list a video of my own making, but it’s legitimate as something that never fails to cheer me up, and my rabbit Hazel is getting his own mini fan-club via his YouTube videos. It’s also not very stoic of me to reveal that, in my spare time, I make music videos of my rabbit to post on YouTube, but we all need hobbies. Hobbies, and The Matys Brothers’ &#8220;Who Stole the Keeshka?&#8221; polka. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fevOZ9b-jQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>#1.  <strong>Stompy lamb</strong><br />
Have you seen The Confused Lamb? Jumping from room to room like a cartoon? I watched it, and in thirty-seven seconds I went from zero to almost hysterical with glee and beside myself with giddy joy. Watch it to make everything in your world infinitely better. For thirty-seven seconds. </p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJCETyiuI_Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
