										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m from Las Cruces, New Mexico, a city populated by around 99,000 people where you can somehow still run into everyone you know at the Super Walmart on Valley Drive and Avenida de Mesilla. It’s the kind of place where high school sports rivalries are king, where teenagers huddle down into a dusty ditch bank and drink watered down beer while fields of cotton grow dry and wooly and the sun bakes the ground into a crack-fissured clay. The weather forecast forms a bingo board of little yellow sunshines, disturbed every once in a good while by thunderous storms that pour in fresh wet stripes punctuated with whipcrack flashes of lightning. </p>
<p>People there talk in funny accents &#8212; a marriage of cool, laid-back, Californian English and dramatically elongated Spanish syllables. One “gets down” from the car to go into the store, and carries the onus of a silly nickname like a mythological birthright. The food is fat with flavor, the culture, thick with artists. Stay long enough and a slow and sleepy boredom seeps deep into your bones, not a boredom that irritates so much as builds a gravity that keeps you in one place, makes you stay &#8212; warm, dream-heavy, happy. When choosing a grad school, I picked faraway places on the map fearing the lotus-eater lull of my beautiful home and an almost genetic tendency toward petrified paralysis. I’ve been working through the cold perspective of living in East Lansing, Michigan for about 10 years, now.</p>
<p>I’d never been to Boston, Massachusetts until a few weeks ago. Everything I knew of the place was a small collage of colonial history, Celtics basketball, the regulars of the downstairs bar, <em>Cheers</em>, and some dramatic scenes from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. (“I gawt huh numbuh&#8211;how bout them ah-pples?”) Representing the non-fiction journal I work for at MSU, I attended a conference for the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) in a complex hamster cage of a hotel conference center/shopping mall in downtown Boston. Imagine thousands of writers anxiously milling about in their scarves and wryly chosen spectacles. Aisle after aisle of booths, books, authors, publishers, editors. In some ways I felt completely at home. Not geographically, per se, but in my seat of comfort and power; I was in a place where my love for literature and language could find friendship and revel in nerdy delights. In other ways I felt completely lost and alienated. Amidst the movement, the clouds of chatter, the thousands of people just like me, I could at times feel dull, null, nil. </p>
<p>The snow outside was falling sideways in wet messy sheets. The streets were puddled with thick ice water ponds much deeper than my sneakered toe could dip. Inside, the conference hummed with body heat and dizzying distraction, the intermingling exhalations of too many mouths.</p>
<p>Making my way through the labyrinthine levels and turns, past the conference center, the Starbucks, the Coach store, beyond the reach of Armani, Louis Vuitton, the kiosks at the mall, down the escalator and across a hidden underpass below the exposed snowy street above, I bought a ticket on the train and booked it to Harvard. Nervous and alone I watched the stops on the map too closely. I focused tightly on the colored lines, the dots for each station, as Boston people populated and detrained the car with an easy indifference.</p>
<p>After trudging through slick muck in Harvard Square for at least twenty minutes, I was cold, lost, and spent, but I found the tattoo shop, finally. My friend’s brother, Sky, was my artist. He’s from my hometown, but I’d never met him. And here we were, together, two desert kids in Massachusetts telling stories of sun, Spanish art, the power of tamales and cholo style. And he was quiet, funny, smart, thoughtful, with a tiny Zia symbol etched behind his ear. A teacher, a maker, an avid Netflixer, much like myself. And he carved a red heart into my forearm, needled in colors of New Mexico sunsets onto the banner, marked my love of TV (with equal parts wink and sincerity) into the geography of my body. When the pain burned hotter and my eyes would roll back away from the whirring, Dia de los Muertos and retablo inspired pieces settled my gaze. We talked about loving a place, our home, and how we could never really go back. Our stories overlapping with the colors he was stitching. Intersecting lines and routes. Mappings. Intersecting lines and roots. </p>
<p>No longer lost, I made my way back to the dirty subway platform, still concrete and grey, still alien, but a little less scary, a little more known. Cold, tired, surrounded by strangers, I carried my new gift home. My heart throbbing in my coat sleeve, hidden, secret, and mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sun is setting in France, sherbet melting down the trees. You tell me about this, describing Rouen, the fresh scallops you sautéed for dinner, all of the little dogs you’ve seen waiting patiently for their owners outside of cafés. And I place you, face down, on my bed. Photograph by photograph, pulled from the walls of my bedroom to the cadence of your voice. I do not tell you that I am doing this, as you describe the sunset. I listen more closely to the students passing you in the hallway at your payphone post. In my life you have faded to a slow background hum and I realize that I have finally fallen out of love. That I am safe now. I can begin to divest myself, article by article, of our relationship.</p>
<p>Objects are defined by the stories of the people who have given them meaning. Meaning that can change as people change, the gifts they gave you or the things they simply left behind taking on new significance over time. </p>
<p>I come from a family of collectors. My maternal grandparents were in the antiques business for years and their house is filled with collections. Cast iron doorstops line the stairs to their third floor library in the shape of everything from sailboats to reindeer. Shelves of duck decoys and a wall of fishing lures (hand-painted and hand-carved) decorate my Grandpa Amthor’s hunting room. He can tell you where he picked up each of the intricate samurai swords he stows in a closet and only brings out on great occasion. He can tell you where he found arrowheads and rare coins as a boy combing through junkyards in Flint. Or about the man who sold him a Confederate Civil War brass belt buckle at a garage sale 20 years ago. His library is filled with weighty tomes on Incan history and old issues of National Geographic. Every time I visit he has something new to show me. Another story, another history&mdash;his or someone else’s, sometimes grandiose, sometimes autobiographical.</p>
<p>As a red-headed toddler with a lisp, I angrily threatened to break all of my mother’s Majolica plates and cut down all of her flowers. Incredulous and amused that I was able to identify her attachment to these things, she still made me eat my broccoli. I grew up healthy and materialistically unsentimental. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>When a person has left your life, they leave behind a space occupied by traces of them. A hickey or a T-shirt. An inscription in a birthday card, a recipe, a bracelet you received for Christmas. These visual cues are not always welcome. They often do not wash off like lipstick bruises. Souvenirs of people you have explored are not always looked upon as fondly as I Love NY memorabilia or shot glasses bearing city names. There are people who have not walked away, but whom you have chosen to remove. Methodically, I have found that the process of removal continues as I purge them from my personal space. In this way, I suppose I edit my own history. Or at least its presence in my present.</p>
<p>Wearing jewelry from an ex has always felt like reasserting that person’s expired claim on me by decorating myself with a token of a now-stale affection. The terms of parting are irrelevant and the piece becomes an artifact. Perhaps stowed in a drawer where it can be called upon to conjure memories at my convenience. Out of sight and yet valued like a private treasure. Too personal to be on display or shared.</p>
<p>There are things that hold meaning to me separate from the intentions of their source. An amber ring that reminds me more of someone’s faith in my ability to make it through a difficult time than it reminds me of him. A silver locket brought back to me from Louisiana one summer, on a chain clasped by a safety pin. It was given to me by a boy I dated briefly in high school, who broke up with me for wearing hot pink pedal pushers to his death metal band’s first show. He was the first person I ever talked to openly about grieving the loss of my cousin&mdash;my childhood best friend. The locket reminds me of her, not him. Years later, I still wear it regularly. Always guarded with my feelings, it still makes me grateful that he showed me it was all right to be human, to know loss and to grieve.</p>
<p>There are many things that have simply found their way to the trash or the Goodwill. Right now there is a pile of old concert T-shirts stuffed between a stack of jeans and a stack of dress pants, aggravating me every time I open my armoire. They belong to a doctor from Royal Oak that I may or may not see again. Still saturated with his cologne, still bearing the shape of his broad shoulders. Calling to mind the beer belly I was always tempted to poke, curious if it would jiggle while we lay naked in bed, fascinated to have discovered its existence. When I broke up with him, I asked if he wanted me to mail his belongings back, but was amicable to the suggestion of meeting up for lunch and returning them in person. Here they sit. Intruding on my space. Imposing him amidst my wardrobe. Do I wait until he is in town again? Do I take them out with this week’s garbage? I will never feel that their ownership has transferred to me. I reject them, as I rejected him. I want to close off this little path back into my life.</p>
<p>These misplaced items so often become territorial battles. Physical proof of the navigational limbo necessary for transitioning to life without someone. Boundary issues. I once had a friend call me in a state of panic from Alaska because she had just broken up with a guy who was back in Michigan. And then she realized that he still had her laptop. She hysterically requested that I make a two-hour drive to recover it for her. Another friend endured months of passive-aggressive emails with an ex that held her things hostage, demanding some sort of emotional reparations. All sorts of hurt and the resulting irrationality taking form in inane objects, being levered in an attempt at closure. A scramble toward it or a resistance to it.</p>
<p>I went through a phase where every time I made an ill-advised sexual decision, I lost an earring. Just one. A pearl in the back of a car. A chandelier on a pillow. I held onto half of a favorite pair for months before finally resigning myself to its place in the garbage. Then I attended a party at his house and he produced the missing gem with a theatrical and very deliberate flourish. Until that moment, I had forgotten all about both the earrings and the sex. And I felt appropriately ridiculous, as if I’d truly scattered myself about town in pieces. </p>
<p>We know that is both illogical and unrealistic to transfer our emotions to objects, to allow people and memories to inhabit them. Yet doing just this is ingrained in us in by the very idea of home. In most cultures, people decorate their surroundings and value their private shelters, asserting ownership over the contents. Home is the haven where you ideally get to choose your visitors. Where you get to assert your taste and your preferences. Where you can lock the door. Where you can display the things that you have collected. Cleaning house can mean sweeping out the unwanted, decluttering the personal space that resides within us more than simply around us. Lingering remnants of relationships (or relations) past can be like a haunting. </p>
<p>There is little to be done with the quiet whispering of names uttered just once muscled through your veins from the silent vault of your heart. I believe that you carry people with you, in fragments that comprise a part of you. Lessons you learned, moments you cherished. Like a person who drinks too much whiskey and later reels at the smell of it, there will be things you would rather expel. It is as natural to get rid of pants that you have outgrown as it is to break the hold of memories you have outgrown, and to assert your ability to do so. To expedite the process. The pieces that you need will stay with you, intangibly. </p>
