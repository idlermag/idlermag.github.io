										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like to think I can work hard on some things, but for the most part, I’ll take the lazy route if you let me. So lately my cooking has consisted of an arsenal of 10 dinners or so and just cycling through them, week after week. Finding a new recipe takes <em>time</em> and then having to go find and buy new ingredients takes even more time, not to mention disproportionate anxiety. Instead I could keep rewatching <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> or read one of the seven books I just bought. Cooking is work.</p>
<p>But I started to get sick of those recipes. We always keep a few packages of shelf-stable gnocchi in the cupboard to make <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/06/06/vegetable-challenge-what-the-h-is-chard/">gnocchi with chard and white beans</a>, but when I went to make it last week, I realized I was groaning about the idea of eating it <em>again.</em> That recipe makes a TON of leftovers that don’t taste as good as the fresh stuff, and I just did not want to be eating that shit for the next week. Not to mention the sort of middle-aged sadness of doing the same thing over and over again and aren’t I supposed to be young and doing new things and OMG WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. Eventually the fear of monotony won out over my lazy ass, and I decided to break out of the rut and find something new.</p>
<p>None of that changes the fact that I already had gnocchi in my cupboard and that gnocchi is delicious. Lately I’ve been sidelined from working out by a fucking TOE injury, so I’ve been trying to eat more vegetables to keep myself from losing all the health. I normally sauté some zucchini in olive oil when I make <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/28/broiler-alert-salmon/" target="_blank">honey-soy broiled salmon</a>, but otherwise I have no idea what to do with it. I found <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/gnocchi_with_zucchini_ribbons_parsley_brown_butter.html" target="_blank">this recipe</a> for gnocchi with zucchini ribbons (?) and parley brown butter from eatingwell.com. I had no idea what zucchini ribbons were or how butter got brown, but it sounded pretty so I went with it.</p>
<p>I wanted to get out of the rut but I’m still lazy, so I also chose this recipe because it doesn’t have a lot of ingredients: zucchini, tomatoes, gnocchi, parsley, butter, parmesan cheese, some spices, and I swapped out the shallots for garlic because ew shallots. To make the zucchini ribbony, the recipe said to use a mandoline slicer. I have no idea what that is, so I just used a potato peeler. I sliced off the ends of the zucchini first so I could stand it up, and cut thin slices downward until I got to the seeds. I didn’t expect mine to look as good as the picture, but they did look pretty cute, if sort of unsettlingly fish-like.  I chopped everything else up while I boiled the gnocchi.</p>

<p>Next, I had to brown the butter. The recipe said to cook it for about two minutes until it starts to brown. That sounded straightforward until I actually started doing it, and then I got worried that “brown” was too close to burn and that I wouldn’t know the difference and then EVERYTHING would be RUINED. While the butter started to melt, I furiously started googling “what does browned butter look like please help” and found something of Alton Brown’s. Most people on the internet, including Alton, seemed to be browning huge pots of butter for some nefarious purpose, whereas I was only doing a tiny slice.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of running between my computer and the stove, I decided to wing it. I waited until after the butter was foamy, when it looked maybe a little bit golden, and decided that was good enough for me. Anything cooked in butter is going to taste fine, anyhow. I added in the cute zucchini:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_9804" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9804" data-attachment-id="9804" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/21/butter-browned/100_2074/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg" data-orig-size="3648,2736" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE Z1012 IS Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1335775807&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.85&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="100_2074" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=640" class="size-full wp-image-9804" title="100_2074" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=960 1280w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9804" class="wp-caption-text">Aw.</p></div>
<p>From then on, the rest of the recipe moved super quickly, only cooking each ingredient for a minute or two before adding the next. The strangest thing about this recipe was that it wanted me to add nutmeg. NUTMEG. Isn’t that like, for coffee and hot cider and desserts? But I figured the people at Eating Well probably know what they’re doing, so I stirred it in along with a few red pepper flakes, like some of the commenters suggested.</p>

<p>LADIES AND GENTS &#8212; I cannot tell you how effing tasty this is. I don’t know whether it was the nutmeg or if browning the butter makes it extra delicious, but it was so good I made it again the next night. The recipe is supposed to be 4 servings but Charlie and I ate the entire panful in one sitting. The zucchini hardly tastes like a vegetable at all; it was almost like a sort of noodle. Even the picky 8-year-old version of me could probably have been tricked into eating this. I might use a little bit less parsley next time, but even that is barely worth mentioning. Instead of being my usual modest self I could not shut up about how good this was and how awesome I am. I was happy to be out of my rut, but I’ll gladly climb into a new, butter-filled one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My enthusiasm is usually a good sign that something is on the way out, and in fact by the time you read this, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History will have started to take down its display of Julia Child&#8217;s kitchen. Originally planned for an 18-month exhibition in 2002, and tucked away out of sight in the museum&#8217;s basement, Child&#8217;s kitchen has been so popular that it&#8217;s been on display for nearly ten years. Even now, elements from the kitchen will be incorporated into a new display <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/julia-childs-kitchen-to-close-temporarily-on-sunday/2012/01/03/gIQA84PdcP_blog.html" target="_blank">&#8220;about big changes in what we ate in the last half of the 20th century.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I am excited about the new exhibit, but I&#8217;m not immune to the lure of a pilgrimage, and I wanted to see the kitchen in it&#8217;s original(ish) state before it gets repurposed.</p>

<p>Julia Child is one of my cooking heroes. She&#8217;s a food icon in the U.S., but unlike most contemporary celebrity chefs, she was never a restauranteur. For all practical purposes, she didn&#8217;t even start cooking until her mid-30s &#8212; and you really should read her accounts of her disastrous first efforts in her memoir <em>My Life in France</em>. Child was, however, a force of nature. When she devoted herself to a task, she was unstoppable. Through hard work and force of will, she graduated from France&#8217;s Le Cordon Bleu cooking school &#8212; you should also read about Child&#8217;s struggles with the school&#8217;s headmistress, Madame Brassart &#8212; and almost immediately set to the task which would in one fashion or another consume the rest of her life, teaching beginners how to start cooking well.</p>
<p>This devotion to beginners and Child&#8217;s irrepressible <em>joie de vivre</em> are the secrets of her enduring popularity. <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> is famously written &#8220;for the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children&#8217;s meals, the parent-chauffeur-den-mother syndrome, or anything else which might interfere with the enjoyment of producing something good to eat.&#8221; Even that &#8220;on occasion&#8221; is essential. Child and her co-authors aren&#8217;t writing for people who <em>never</em> have to worry about money, waistlines, or children. Instead, Child is imagining the audience for her book as people like herself &#8212; people who are perhaps not (yet) accomplished cooks, but who want to eat and cook just a little better than they otherwise might, and just need a supportive teacher to help them get there.</p>
<p>And Child was born to be that teacher, telling us that it was okay if things didn&#8217;t quite go right, that it&#8217;s good to stretch ourselves in the kitchen. It&#8217;s not as hard as it seems, and, even better, it&#8217;s worth the time and the effort you put in. And perhaps best of all, we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of using too much butter.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more than a little evidence of Child&#8217;s impact even today. Her <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> is still on bookstore shelves next to the <em>Joy of Cooking</em> that Child so revered. (There are two &#8212; count &#8217;em, two &#8212; copies of <em>Joy</em> on the shelf in Child&#8217;s kitchen.)</p>

<p>There are two volumes of Child&#8217;s <em>The French Chef</em> available on DVD, and you can still catch reruns of Child&#8217;s later series <em>Baking with Julia</em> on PBS. The latter was filmed in the 1990s, and Child is mostly an observer and kitchen assistant to the featured cooks. She&#8217;s much older than her <em>French Chef</em> days, with a pronounced stoop in her back, but the voice and personality are still there, and you can still catch her dipping her fingers in the chocolate if you pay attention.</p>
<p>There was of course, far more to Child than her cooking. If you dig a little deeper you&#8217;ll find that she was struggling with alcoholism during her <em>French Chef</em> days, and it&#8217;s tempting to attribute her <em>bonhomie</em>, as well as that famous dropped chicken, to the drinking. But it&#8217;s never really as simple as that. When Child escaped the bottle, she was still the same Julia, and it&#8217;s possible to watch her lifetime behind the camera and never dream that her struggles were so severe.</p>

Hidden among all the pots, pans, and knives in Julia&#8217;s kitchen is Child&#8217;s government-issue &#8220;emergency signal mirror,&#8221; a relic of her World War II service in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services" target="_blank">Office of Strategic Services</a> in China. There is debate even today over whether Child herself or the man she met during her service and eventually married were ever spies themselves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible to eat well, to cook well, something really special every once in a while, and to be totally, completely awesome even if you never, ever let anyone know.</p>
<p>Child kept her OSS signal mirror in the junk drawer in her kitchen until the day she donated the room to the Smithsonian. As of yesterday, at least, they were still together.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why Child always had a smile on her face. And if Julia was imagining writing for an audience like herself, then maybe we can imagine ourselves to be a little more like her as well. Maybe getting to know the kitchen a little better can mean being a little bit more awesome too.</p>
