										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago I read the sci-fi/fantasy/comedy <em>Good Omens</em> by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. The plot revolves around the search for the Anti-Christ, a young boy living in England. An angel and a demon are determined to work together to prevent the apocalypse because after all of their centuries living in our world they have quite grown to like it, they even like humans a little bit. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse need to find the boy as well so they can get the ball rolling on ending the world as we know it. Other people involve themselves in the search as well, some seeking to end the world, some to prolong its existence.  </p>

They told me it was his writing style that I was enjoying and if I planned on reading either of the authors I should read Gaiman. No one mentioned giving Terry Pratchett a try.</p>
<p>I loved it. It was funny and light and definitely something I could read again and find new details that would entertain me. I actually had trouble not rereading it immediately. I usually don’t laugh out loud while reading books but this one had me shaking with laughter. I would read random sentences or paragraphs aloud to my husband just to have someone to share the humor with. </p>
<p>The book was more than just light fiction, too. The characters were very well written &#8212; there was quite the cast but each individual held their own. While it is meant to be humorous, and succeeds quite well, it was good fiction too. I might place Christopher Moore and Tom Holt squarely in the goofy sci-fi/fantasy column, but <em>Good Omens</em> had that little something more. It wasn’t just silly for the sake of being silly, it was a good story told in a light-hearted fashion.</p>
<p>After my love affair with <em>Good Omens</em> was over, I bought <em>American Gods</em> and <em>Anansi Boys</em>, both by Neil Gaiman. Then I pretty much forgot about them until a few weeks ago. <em>Good Omens</em> was not fresh in my mind when I started <em>American Gods</em>, which is probably for the best. If the writing style in <em>Good Omens</em> was supposed to be Gaiman’s, the humor was all Pratchett’s. I’m sure that neither is really true. The two writers collaborated on the novel and there is no way something so cohesive and well done could have been achieved if both men didn’t have a similar sense of humor. But if no one had told me who wrote <em>American Gods</em> I’m not sure I would have thought the same author was involved in both projects.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say the book isn’t good. I really like it. The main character, Shadow, is well written. I want only good things to happen to him. I pity him a little more than I would like to, but shit keeps going down and he gets swept up in so much bad stuff that it’s hard not to feel bad for the guy. The gist of the plot is this: the old gods that people brought to American when they came here are dying. No one worships them and they are fading away. Some have adapted to a smaller life and eke out a living, but some are angry and want to take back the power they once had. The new gods in America are technology and media, television and highways. A battle is coming and Shadow gets caught up in the middle.</p>
<p>At a few points the narrative style is slow and I ended up setting the book aside even though I wanted to read more, I just needed a break from the description of everything. I always wanted to know what would happen next, but I didn’t always want to slog through pages and pages to get there. The last hundred pages or so pick up and while reading the ending I only put the book down when I had to, always a plus. The beginning had pulled me in quickly but I have to say the middle lagged, a lot. Maybe I was expecting too much. I thoroughly enjoyed <em>Good Omens</em> and while I knew that <em>American Gods</em> was a serious book, I thought it might share some properties with the book that got me interested in Gaiman in the first place. There is a large cast of characters and they are skillfully woven together. I never mistake one for another and I haven’t had to go back to figure out who someone was when they reappeared later in the book. The writing is excellent and the story idea is fantastic, I’m just not sure all those people were right in shoving Pratchett out of the way to place the spot light solely on Gaiman.</p>
<p>In doing a little research for this column I found that Pratchett not only did more of the actual writing, Gaiman was working on his <em>Sandman</em> series at the time so it just happened to work out that Pratchett wrote more words, but his most famous series of books, the <em>Discworld</em> series is satirical. So why did everyone who found out I was reading <em>Good Omens</em> recommend the more serious minded author over the guy who has written dozens of comic fantasy books. Discworld is a flat planet resting on the backs of four elephants that balance on a giant turtle. How is this not the guy you point someone to when they are reading <em>Good Omens</em>, a book where the baby Anti-Christ is given to the wrong parents at a hospital? </p>
<p>I certainly don’t dislike Neil Gaiman. I’ll read <em>Anansi Boys</em>, the kind of sequel to <em>American Gods</em>. It turns out I already own <em>Neverwhere</em>, another popular Gaiman book, so I am all set on being a fan of his. I’m just disappointed that I came to him because of a collaboration with someone I will probably end up liking even better. If I had known that Tori Amos was referencing Gaiman in &#8220;Tear in Your Hand&#8221; (&#8220;If you need me, me and Neil&#8217;ll be hangin&#8217; out with the dream king. Neil says hi by the way&#8221;) I feel like I would have known what to expect from him more. </p>
<p>I think I will try out the <em>Discworld</em> series next though. And maybe I can be the lone voice telling people that if they like <em>Good Omens</em> they should try Terry Pratchett out next. Neil Gaiman is getting enough love already</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the woman who shelves the scifi section at my bookstore slid the new Orson Scott Card book to me last week I saw something disturbing on the cover.</p>
<p>Aaron Johnston.</p>
<p>Who was this guy? Was Card headed down the James Patterson path, using a helper to write his stories? I was concerned. Card has published book one in the Young Adult series Pathfinder and an adult scifi series The Mithermages in the past two years. He is working on book two in both series, the YA book, <em>Ruins, </em>comes out this October and the Adult Scifi book, <em>The Gate Thief, </em>is currently set to be published in mid-March 2013. That’s a lot of books.</p>
<p>His newest book, <em>Earth Unaware, </em>is the story of the first Bugger invasion. It takes place before <em>Ender’s Game. </em>Unlike<em> Shadows in Flight</em>, the new book is a full-length novel. I know the Ender saga is a big money maker for Card. It’s certainly my favorite and I love that he is expanding the story to include what happened before Ender came along in addition to all his books on the aftermath of what became viewed as a horrible xenocide. I wasn’t loving that he called in help.</p>
<p>Help in novel writing seems to be catching on. While Tom Clancy and Clive Cussler both use secondary authors, whose names appear in a smaller font at the bottom of the dust jacket, James Patterson is the man who seems to use co-authors the most. A quick Wikipedia search shows that of his 105 published and soon to be published works, 60 were written with someone else. That’s a lot of help. And it’s not the same co-authors helping out with the same series. The Women’s Murder Club has two different co-authors, first Andrew Gross then Maxine Paetro. His Daniel X series has seen four different co-authors for five different books.</p>
<p>While some of these helpers go on to create works on their own and most of the interviews they give speak glowingly of working with “Jim”, I wonder how much work they are doing so his name can appear as the headliner. I was disappointed to see my favorite author slipping into the same “publish as much as possible” mode.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the New York Times ran a story about authors, especially those in the mystery and romance genres, beginning to publish more than once a year. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/business/in-e-reader-age-of-writers-cramp-a-book-a-year-is-slacking.html?pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/business/in-e-reader-age-of-writers-cramp-a-book-a-year-is-slacking.html?pagewanted=all</a>) It used to be the norm for your favorite genre author to come out with a new book about the same time every year. I know I looked forward to the newest Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum mystery every June. Now one book a year isn’t enough. Publishers want short stories to whet the readers’ appetite between books, they want high ebook sales, and bigger bibliographies to post on Wikipedia. To do this, sometimes writers need help. I understand keeping up with Patterson is hard work. But there should be a better way. Can’t readers just expand their author list and be patient?</p>
<p>The article goes on to state that literary novelists can still put out one book a decade and call it good enough. But not everyone in the book world is lucky enough to be considered literary. And most people read mysteries and romances, meaning those books get published more, even if it’s only a handful of authors and their new assistants.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why the idea of having a co-author irks me so much. Stephen King cowrote two of my favorite books, <em>The Talisman </em>and <em>Black House, </em>with fellow horror author Peter Straub. Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman teamed up for <em>Good Omens</em>, a book I had trouble putting down. But these authors were peers. I feel like Patterson and his cronies are abusing their power, giving outlines and edits to someone else who is doing all the real work.</p>
<p>I looked up Aaron Johnston. I was afraid he would be some nobody who would ruin my favorite book series, seeing co-writing with Card as a step up in his own career. I was afraid that Card had found a lackey to write his books for him and the quality of those books would decrease. Johnston is a playwright, he writes screenplays, and graphic novels. Almost everything has to do with Orson Scott Card.</p>
<p>It turns out the two men have known each other for some time. <em>Earth Unaware </em>is not the first book they’ve written together. In 2007 they published <em>Invasive Procedures, </em>a novel based on a screenplay written by Johnston, which was based on a short story written by Card. In <em>Posing as People </em>Johnston and two other writers write plays based on other Card short stories. Card directed those plays himself. Johnston contributed an essay to <em>The Authorized Ender Companion </em>and wrote half of the Ender graphic novels. He seemed dedicated.</p>
<p>Although I might not classify the two men as peers; Straub, King, Pratchett, and Gaiman were all well known in their genre before teaming up; I don’t think either man is using the other. I do wonder if I’ll be able to tell that this book wasn’t written by Card alone. I also wonder how often Aaron Johnston’s name will grace the cover of Card’s books in the future and if it will ever get any bigger. That may be the sign of true collaboration, when you let the coauthor put his name first.</p>
