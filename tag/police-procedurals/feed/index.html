										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Prime Suspect</strong></em> (NBC, Thursdays)</p>
<p>First and foremost, watch the original British <em>Prime Suspect</em> starring Helen Mirren.  That woman is a goddess for a reason.  I watched the series over the summer and was blown away by how intensely it activated my emotions, mostly anger, toward the patriarchy.  This program, along with its new American counterpart series on NBC, focuses on good police work &#8212; good woman’s police work specifically &#8212; and how tough it is to carry out in a hostile work environment.</p>
<p>The newer version stars Maria Bello as Jane Timony, a detective who’s a bit more rugged than the commanding-yet-reserved protagonist we find across the pond.  And I tell you  folks, I’m loving seeing Jane on my TV.  I was raised on <em>Hill Street Blues</em>, <em>Crime Story</em>, <em>Miami Vice</em>, <em>Law and Order</em>, etc.  If a primetime detective drama was on, school nights be damned, I was perched on a recliner at my father’s side sharing the slivered sections of an orange and tossing around theories on the case.  I’m pretty passionate about my police procedurals to begin with, but it is so awesome to flip on the tube and see a WOMAN as the main character, the one with all the answers, the one who we root for.  She is not a sidekick.  She is the story.  </p>
<p>Bello plays Timony, a soon(?)-to-be ex-smoker with a bitter balance of cockiness and frustration.  She is just as good if not better than her male counterparts, all of whom care deeply for one another as fellow members of a hardcore uniformed boys’ club, and she has to fight for every freaking inch she can take to simply have a fair shot at a case and some semblance of authority.  Where the British series made this discrimination more painfully palpable by drawing out the uncomfortable feelings between the department men and this woman to nearly unbearable lengths, the American series is a bit blunter in its approach.  The same misogynist themes play out but aggressions come to a head much more quickly and audibly &#8212; per usual one can feel the network racing to hook the audience and not be too boring.  And I do miss this slower pacing because it is precisely what stirred me into my rage.  The everyday quality of the hatred really made prominent the daily discrimination that many women must feel at work.  Exaggerating every millisecond of discomfort nicely showcased the abomination hidden in what could easily be seen as a normal work scene.  </p>
<p>Even, so NBC appears like it will do right by <em>Prime Suspect</em>.  Bello’s rough handed character is strong; her humor is sharp and sarcastically callous while remaining fitting to the program’s tone.  If the writers keep her complicated, let her lose, capture her humanity, the show could match up to and perhaps surpass its inspiration.  Do watch and give a good cop a chance.  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things to come out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;and there were a number of great things that came out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;was the character of Renee Montoya. As a uniformed patrolwoman, Montoya starts off as the smart, straight-laced junior foil to the self-serving, corner-cutting, Batman-hating Detective Harvey Bullock. They&#8217;re both good cops in the end, but while Bullock will lie to cover his own ass and resents Batman for making him look ineffective, Montoya is honest, honorable, and knows that Batman is the same. When the series got a redesign, Montoya got a promotion to detective, and was partnered with Bullock. The comics, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t have much use for Montoya as a uniform, so DC made her a detective and partnered her with Bullock in her very first appearance. She&#8217;s put to great use in the extended &#8220;No Man&#8217;s Land&#8221; storyline, but really comes into her own when the Gotham City Police Department is given its chance to shine in the short-lived but absolutely wonderful <em>Gotham Central</em>.</p>
<p><em>Gotham Central</em> ran from 2003 to 2006, and Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka traded off storylines for the entirety of that run. While <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s fan base was (and is) avid, it was never large, which is something of a crime. The writing and art in <em>Gotham Central</em> are pitch-perfect. The characters are put-upon, overworked, and worst of all in a city like Gotham, honest. Brubaker and Rucka did a difficult thing in an extraordinary way by telling stories that seem exactly the right size in a normally hyper-colored, overexcited universe. (Check out the Teen Titans cameo in the &#8220;Dead Robin&#8221; storyline. It&#8217;s perfectly done.) If you&#8217;re the sort of person who claims to love Batman stories because of the human dimension&mdash;where Batman is just a man pushed to do incredible things at the edge of human (and not superhuman) ability&mdash;then <em>Gotham Central</em> will either give you what you never realized you had always been looking for, or it will call you out as a liar. The Batman is the superhuman presence in these pages, always a force for good, but not always on the cops&#8217; side, as they are well aware.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4433" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4433" data-attachment-id="4433" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/16/the-badges-behind-the-bat/ma0511-2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg" data-orig-size="1140,941" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ma0511" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=300&#038;h=247" alt="Batman in action" title="ma0511" width="300" height="247" class="size-medium wp-image-4433" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=300&amp;h=247 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=598&amp;h=494 598w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=150&amp;h=124 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4433" class="wp-caption-text">Batman in action</p></div> In the pages of <em>Gotham Central</em>, Batman is almost a wraith, only occasionally present, and even then wrapped in constant darkness. You almost never see him in action, and even when you do, you don&#8217;t really see him so much as see the effect of what he just did.</p>
<p>On a side note, the series really do a good job of portraying that darkness as something the Batman himself <em>does</em>. There&#8217;s a scene in a later issue where a detective accidentally shoots Batman, and when he&#8217;s laying unconscious on the floor, he&#8217;s just a man in a belt and a cape. As you can see, he gets better.</p>
<p>Death is a troublesome thing in mainstream comic books, and <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s treatment of death is one of the best measures of the title&#8217;s success. As much as comic books would like to tell you that they&#8217;ve grown up, mortality is usually dealt with in a manner that is at best adolescent: Major characters survive against incredible odds while minor characters and extras, in the worst hands, are used as cannon fodder&mdash;a way to titilate the reader and pretend to raise the dramatic stakes by splashing the page with day-glo red. The Batman comics are not immune from this, and a particularly awful recent example can be found in the 3-issue <em>Batman/Darkest Night</em> tie-in miniseries. Darkest Night was a DC-wide crossover event where, um, you know Green Lantern? It turns out there are &#8220;lanterns&#8221; for every color in the spectrum. Just go with it. In Darkest Night you find out there are Black Lanterns, too. Who raise the dead to kill people. And stuff. Anyway, it&#8217;s a very un-Batman, cosmic story, but they did a Batman tie-in anyway. It starts with dead Batman villains raised as Black Lanterns who attack the police department and kill a bunch of cops. Jim and Barbara Gordon get away, because they&#8217;re the only people who really matter, but dozens of nameless uniforms are slaughtered. In all honesty, it&#8217;s offensive. Not because it&#8217;s excessive violence, but because it&#8217;s stupid violence. Every uniformed officer in those pages may as well be wearing a red uniform on an old episode of <em>Star Trek</em>. They exist only to be killed, and in my mind, that&#8217;s lazy, sadistic writing. It makes me feel worse about humanity for reading it, and not in a <a target="new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels#Part_IV:_A_Voyage_to_the_Country_of_the_Houyhnhnms">Gulliver&#8217;s Travels/Houyhnhnm</a> kind of way, but in an I&#8217;m-not-sure-why-I-bother-to-read-comics-anyway kind of way.</p>

That&#039;s right. Page four.</p></div> There are several significant deaths in <em>Gotham Central</em>, and Commisioner Atkins (you read that right) is criticized at one point for having a far higher fatality rate in the Major Crimes Unit than Gordon did. (Gordon, at the time, was retired. He&#8217;s since returned to the job.) Every fatality in <em>Gotham Central</em>, however, matters. They affect the entire unit, and they&#8217;re painful to read because in every case they happen to a character who is made to feel like a person, and not just a plot point. Detective Charlie Fields is murdered by Mr. Freeze on the fourth page of the first issue&mdash;and he&#8217;s killed hard, by the way. Freeze knocks apart Fields&#8217; frozen body in front of his partner&mdash;meaning that Fields isn&#8217;t given much time to become a character on his own, but his death haunts not just the next few issues, but the rest of the series.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4436" style="width: 305px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4436" data-attachment-id="4436" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/16/the-badges-behind-the-bat/ma0511-1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg" data-orig-size="495,503" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ma0511-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=295" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=495" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=295&#038;h=300" alt="Montoya and Allen" title="ma0511-1" width="295" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-4436" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=295&amp;h=300 295w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=148&amp;h=150 148w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg 495w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4436" class="wp-caption-text">Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen</p></div> The heart of the series, at least for me, is Renee Montoya, her relationship with her partner, Crispus Allen, and the way it all falls apart. By the time <em>Gotham Central</em> takes place, Renee Montoya has survived No Man&#8217;s Land, in which Gotham City was abandoned to anarchy after an earthquake destroyed most of the city, but she&#8217;s a character on the edge, watching good people get hurt and die around her, and ostracized by the department and her family when she&#8217;s outed by a lesbian. (By Two-Face, who still has a thing for her after No Man&#8217;s Land. Just go read it.) Everything comes to a head when Allen is murdered by a corrupt cop, Jim Corrigan, who gets away with it. Montoya, who has been less and less in control of her anger over the course of the series, bursts into Corrigan&#8217;s apartment in a drunken rage, beats his girlfriend (who is also a cop) unconscious, and puts a gun to Corrigan&#8217;s head. In itself, it&#8217;s a rather clichéd officer-on-the-edge revenge scene, but the muted artwork and the relationship between Montoya, Allen, and the reader that Brubaker and Rucka have built over the course of the previous thirty-some issues really raise the scene a level above your average mainstream comic book.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Gotham Central</em> wasn&#8217;t perfect, and wasn&#8217;t a great fit for the DC universe, as a rather awkward Infinite Crisis tie-in issue demonstrates. Overworked detectives make for great noir/procedural stories, but not as much for cosmic/mystical/end-of-the-world stuff. (Interestingly, or painfully, both Montoya and Allen have taken big superhero turns since the end of <em>Gotham Central</em>. Montoya worked on her martial arts and meditation skills to become The Question, and Allen became the new superviolent mystical incarnation of The Spectre. Rucka still writes Montoya admirably as The Question, but Allen was such a great cop character, it&#8217;s a bit sad to see him miscast and largely ignored as The Spectre.) It is however, a great demonstration (along with work like <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/16/watching-the-detectives/">Sam and Twitch</a>), that the police noir-procedural is an amazingly underutilized genre in the comic book world. We need more of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By nature I’m impatient.  I find watching shows during their regular season excruciating, the week (or WEEKS) between episodes is an eternity. I’m strictly a marathon girl. I consume words and film voraciously. I watch entire seasons of a show on a Sunday. I read graphic novels in single sitting, breaking only for grilled cheese and <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>.  In a way, this makes me a terrible fan of serial comics. Luckily, I catch on to everything late. </p>
<p>One of the attractive qualities of serial comics, that make them preferable to graphic novels to me, are their divisions. The stories come in digestible parts, punctuated by ominous ellipses or the “To Be Continued. . .” cliffhanger. The space between books, much like the end credits of a show, are just a palate cleanser. Enough time to grab some chips.  </p>

Never having watched a single episode of <em>Law and Order</em> or <em>The X-Files</em> outside of a classroom, I was skeptical of the &#8220;good cops in a corrupt world&#8221; set up I inferred from the book’s cover. To quote the medical examiner Dr. McCroy “I ain’t all about that Scully shit.” But this book was lent to me by my new friend Laura, who extracted promises that it would be returned unharmed and in a timely fashion, and also required a kidney as collateral. And because I really love making new friends, AND function best with both kidneys, I decided to give it a go. Three pages in and I had changed my mind about detective fiction, and decided I would trust Laura’s judgment from now until the end of time. </p>
<p><em>Sam and Twitch</em> is, at its heart, a collaborative effort. The gumshoe duo made their public debut as peripheral characters in the <em>Spawn</em> series. The pair was created by Todd McFarlane, who turned them over shortly after their conception to the pen of Brian Michael Bendis. Bendis found the detectives fully formed and spun the dialogue of their adventures. A team of artists led by Angel Medina (of <em>KISS comics</em> fame) then brought Bendis’s rough sketches to ass-kicking life.  </p>
<p>The story follows recently reinstated detectives of the NYPD as they investigate a series of murders that systematically wipe out the reigning mob family of NYC. The killers leave behind body parts with genetic anomalies as a twisted calling card. The opening crime scene is marked by four thumbs, all seemingly from the same person, in varying states of genetic completion. Thumbs! Brilliant! </p>

<p>As the department and city unravel around them , Sam, Twitch, and their trusty medical examiner work in tandem to restore order. </p>
<p>In the NYPD, as in love, opposites attract. Sam and Twitch, though essentially opposite in terms of appearance (Twitch reminds me of Einstein, while Sam is a John Goodman type) and demeanor, balance each other.  Sam is the one-man wolf pack, shoot from the hip cop. Twitch describes him thusly: “He’s loud, verbose, mule headed. Frighteningly overweight. He habitually smells like whatever he had for lunch the day before. He has the worst case of low blood sugar I have ever, EVER been witness to.” He seems to be eating everything in sight, including his words. Twitch, on the other hand, is wiry with a shock of electrified hair; he’s an expert marksman whose movements are as measured as his speech.  He’s a family man expelled from his home and family by his wife because of his refusal to commit his time to anything except his work. It’s easy to prefer Twitch at first, until you realize Sam’s ultimate bad-assness. </p>

There’s real humor here, not gag humor, or puns, but real, human humor. The kind of inside jokes and the repertoire that make our friends the funniest people we know. There’s warmth between Sam and Twitch with just enough machismo and professional ice to make it believable. Bendis has created a relationship between the detectives that is somewhere between best friends, brothers, co-workers and partners in crime. </p>
<p><em>The Bendis Collection</em> gathers the Sam and Twitch &#8220;Udaku&#8221; storyline in amazingly illustrated, full-color panels. The effect is cinematic and fluid. I felt like I was watching a Pixar movie shot not in Andy’s attic, but in a seedy underworld somewhere between real life and Goodfellas. The images flow along with the dialogue making the action of the panels visceral: the chase scenes, the perfectly executed gun shots, the blown tires, Sam flipping off Internal Affairs, the crime scenes. The panels are so detailed and alive it’s as if they scroll across the pages, flipping them for you.  </p>
<p>This brilliantly executed collection weds the pace of an action adventure with the heart of a novel. Every panel as haunting as it is beautiful. This is the comic as high art and literature. Future artists take note, paper your walls with these pages as a constant reminder of how perfect an art form comics can be.</p>
