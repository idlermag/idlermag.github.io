										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who knows me at all knows I am not particularly musical. It’s not just that I can’t play an instrument or carry much of a tune. I don’t even have much of an ear for music. My iPod, at any given time, has about a dozen songs on it &#8212; ones that would make any sophisticated music fan blanche, I’m sure &#8212; that I listen to relentlessly and may rotate every few weeks. I buy a new song here or there, but my diehard CD collection consists of about two dozen albums, almost all by two or three different artists. I think I had one piano lesson as a child before begging my parents to just let me go back to my colored pencils and Bristol board. I just don’t <em>get</em> music the way I get more visual media. I never really have.</p>
<p>Looking back, many of the kids with whom I became close friends used music as an escape much the way I used comic books. If you grow up feeling different from your peers, or even your family, having something to take you out of that world &#8212; and into one where being different means being powerful and admired &#8212; is almost critical to make it through. It’s why I imagine so many of the most popular super-hero comics star teams. Outsiders, who sometimes might otherwise be hated or feared, band together to not only attempt something greater than themselves, but also to form a new family that accepts their uniqueness, even celebrates it. Occasionally, that team has been a blood-related family at the start (as is the case of Marvel Comics’ <em>Fantastic Four</em>), but most of the time, it is in strangers that the lonely or orphaned hero finds camaraderie and acceptance. Like forming a band with those other kids no one seems to want to hang around, comic book creators relentlessly imagine families not-so nuclear to grant characters and readers validation of their worth, oddities aside.</p>
<p>That non-nuclear families so pervade the comic book genre makes <em>Hopeless Savages</em> that much more unique for its own outsider status. Published in multiple mini-series by Oni Press and recently collected in a <em>Greatest Hits</em> edition, <em>Hopeless Savages</em> recounts the life of a punk rock couple, Dirk Hopeless and Nikki Savage, who left groupies and concerts behind for the white picket fence dream to have a family out in the suburbs. Far from losing themselves in the conformity of Middle America, the Hopeless-Savages have raised four <strong>extraordinary</strong> children, in every sense of that word. Named by their parents to forever remind them of their origins, Rat Bastard, Arsenal Fierce, Twitch Strummer, and Skank Zero Hopeless-Savage are unquestionably chips off their parents’ old block &#8212; cultural outsiders who didn’t have to look very far at all to find their accepting clan.</p>

<p>Rather than deliver a fairy tale existence for the entire family, however, series creator and writer Jen Van Meter goes to great lengths to make each child’s individuality a clear and central focus for the narrative. Eldest daughter Arsenal is a dojo master and martial arts expert from a family that urges peaceful, non-violent resolution whenever possible to conflict. Youngest son Twitch adheres to Mod style and subculture, a sharp departure from his parents’ dedication to the tenets of punk, but a distinction far more germane than his homosexuality. Eldest son Rat took the greatest leap away from his family’s standards in abandoning his hard-core punk style after receiving a teenage broken heart. Restyling himself to adopt the corporate fast track, Rat (calling himself Dave, after his father’s given name) is found at the beginning of the series after ten years away, working for a Starbucks-like coffee conglomerate. While Rat returns to the family dynamic in an urgent adventure to save his parents’ lives, he never quite goes back to his outrageous childhood self. In a house where everyone else is so sure of her or himself, Rat is still searching for his genuine identity, still trying to be comfortable in his own skin.</p>

<p>But it is around youngest daughter Zero that Van Meter’s story most steadily revolves, as the aspiring punk musician evolves from little girl to young woman. At the beginning of the series, Zero is a brash, determined child who speaks her mind unapologetically and gets in way over her head on a regular basis, particularly when her parents go missing in an apparent kidnapping. Of the entire family, Zero takes Rat’s departure most personally, only reluctantly including him in the search for Dirk and Nikki. She takes her parents’ legacy seriously, so much so as to brand Rat a traitor for choosing to leave behind the family name and business. Even so, Zero is the fiercest defender of Rat’s honor, even years later, in confronting the girl that broke his heart. Most like her mother in exuberant temper and sharp wit, Zero is intensely protective, even at a young age, of the life her mother left Nebraska to acquire. </p>
<p>Zero’s maturation into her own person in high school is no less tumultuous than normal, despite her one-track desire to follow in her mother’s footsteps. First true love hits hard in the form of Ginger Kincaid, another social outcast, but this time of the science nerd variety. The road to Zero and Ginger’s relationship is a mighty bumpy one, as a series of minor teenage misdeeds &#8212; and one serious offense in punching a boy at school for inferring too much from her given name &#8212; leads to extensive grounding at the hands of her overprotective mom. Drawn in the adolescent style now made famous by his <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> series, second series artist Bryan Lee O’Malley captures so perfectly the pains to which Zero and Ginger go through to finally align their stars. </p>

<p><em>Hopeless Savages</em> is uniquely blessed by many different artists, yet the differences never feel arbitrary &#8212; much like those of the family members themselves. Original series artist Christine Norrie may feel like the definitive penciller for a family somewhat rough around the edges, but other contributors (such as <em>Conan</em> and <em>Batman</em> artist Becky Cloonan and <em>Anya’s Ghost</em> creator Vera Brosgol) bring an almost mandatory eclecticism to the book. This is in some ways how I imagine an album must get assembled from multiple songs: each one has its own unique beat, but reflect a novel, yet important, aspect of the overall score. </p>
<p>The cast of <em>Hopeless Savages</em> is no different, each bringing his or her own individuality to the mix. How the story as whole comes together, though, is what lifts the readers’ spirits and inspires a great escape. Jen Van Meter has crafted a family we’d all want to join, but one that also ultimately leads us to look at our own &#8212; blood-born or made &#8212; and appreciate and admire the differences within. Not every family may stand out from those around them the way this punk rock tribe may, but it’s hard not to want to get yours to try after sharing their world for a little while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My parents were divorced and my mom was mentally ill throughout most of my childhood so I didn’t always learn a lot about how to be a “proper” girl or woman &#8212; I’m an adult who is still figuring out liquid liner.  In a number of ways, I love that I wasn’t forced into a pink category, that I played Ninja Turtles and watched wrestling, that I had He-Man action figures and wore weird mismatched outfits of my choosing. So, please don’t take the following text to mean that my dad was some monster. This is definitely NOT the intent and in fact he’s a lot more like Santa Claus than anyone else I can think of. He did a pretty good job trying to help me be me and grow and take care of myself, but his lack of hair knowledge was a bit of a hindrance. He didn’t help me with my “Embarrassing Moments” hair woes because, as a man, he didn’t know they existed. What I know now that I didn’t then is that society is kind of a jerk to women and it expects a lot out of our bodies and out of our hair. I wish I had had a Frida Kahlo fairy godmother to help me suss this out earlier, or maybe Madonna, if she’d kept those thick spidery brows, or fellow helmet head Daria. But I didn’t. So, here are a few things I wish I had known.  </p>
<p><strong>I Wish Someone Had Taught Me:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The difference between high brow and low brow.</strong></li>
<p>When I was in the sixth grade I had full-on 80’s Madonna brows, the kind that have at least four regions to each brow, they’re so big. What no one told me was if you paid a professional to wax or expertly tweeze that bottom chunk, you could still be left with 2 fairly thick, yet fantastic eyebrows. Or, that pretty much anything is better than giving a sixth grader free-tweezing reign over her forehead hair because she is gonna pluck the fuck outta those suckers and then become a 31-year-old person who can list “growing brows” as a hobby on Facebook.</p>
<p>Ok, to be fair, I knew that waxing made the brows look amazing. My friends all shared stories about how their mom took them to Elizabeth Arden, or even a hair cutting place I had actually heard of. However, I felt I would not be afforded such a luxury &#8212; how could my dad understand that he’d be helping me shape the brows that would define my life?! I just wish future me could go back and give my lovely Madonna brows a pep talk, maybe with a Whoopie Goldberg <em>Ghost</em>-style speech to really get the point across, “Little self, put those tweezers down &#8212; you’re in danger, girl!”</p>
<li><strong>That straighteners exist and that naturally pretty hair is a lie.</strong></li>
<p>Okay, maybe not all pretty hair is a lie but at least that “pretty” is suspicious.  For about 25 years of my life I’ve assumed that popular girl hair was a magically bouncy, shiny and fantastic boon bequeathed upon only the richest and fanciest look-at-me-I-eat-at-Red-Lobster-and-it’s-not-even-a-special- occasion divas. In my younger days, I assumed that the Barbie girls just woke up with perfectly scrunchied barrel curls, bangs elegantly reaching skyward with a mere spritz of spray.  If they needed a little help perhaps a ritual blood-letting or a simple kitten sacrifice to Aphrodite, and voila! Perfection. (Because popular girls read their Edith Hamilton, right?) I was sure I was destined to my thick, coarse, bell-shaped helmet because all I had was a round brush, blow dryer, and my stupid Catholic saints to help me. </p>
<p>Alas, there is no Saint Perpetua de la Coiffure and I didn’t really have internet access until college, so you can imagine my shock when I discovered hair straightening technology. Science! After a quick 40-minute blow dry I can now straighten 500 or so tressy chunks of my head and thusly trick everyone into the belief that my mammalian strands are not just normal, but nice, even. Until it rains.</p>
<li><strong>That perms don’t belong on third graders.</strong></li>
<p>This should be self explanatory.  Why did we DO this?  Why did adults let us do this?  How was looking like Eraserhead &#8212; not to mention pouring pungent chemicals all over a child’s noggin &#8212; a cute trend in the way of slap bracelets and hypercolor t-shirts?!  Forget the face on Mars, this is a UNIVERSAL MYSTERY.</p>
<li><strong>That, “Hey, don’t shave all your parts.”</strong></li>
<p>When I got the green light from my dad to go ahead and shave my legs if I felt like it, I had a bit of a lightbulb moment. As I watched my gams shed their thick and lustrous Sasquatch fur, I felt a strange sensation of feminine empowerment. . . or was that the stinging pain of bleeding? Oh, how soft and silky and attractive my stems/stumps had become!  </p>
<p>What if&#8230;what if&#8230;What if I shaved the entirety of my body to be free of hairs (A.K.A. The Follicled Menace)?!! </p>
<p>Oh, and I did it.  Knuckles, elbows, face. Peach fuzz be damned, I’m a LADY!  What I wish I had the forethought to have seen at this turning point was that, much like the hair on my head, all those little hairs were gonna grow back &#8212; and thickly and thoroughly with a pokey vengeance and much itching.  And it’s stupid to shave your toe knuckles, Stupid. And hey, remember your dad’s face? How he shaves it and gets a 5 o’clock shadow at noon? Well, shit. So, “hey, don’t shave all your parts” would have been a nice heads up. That’s all I’m saying.</p>
<li><strong>That dyeing your mustache will just give you a creepy blonde mustache.</strong></li>
<p>Again, help a sister out. I have a pretty sizable overbite and never got braces because, “meh, they look fine.” There’s no way my family was shelling out cash to deal with my Magnum P.I. situation.  I took matters into my own hands on a tip from <em>Young and Modern</em> (<em>YM</em>) magazine and I sported a blonde ‘stache that perfectly matched my jet black hair for an embarrassing portion of my existence on this planet.</p>
<li><strong>That conditioner is a thing and so is social conditioning.</strong></li>
<p>When I was a little kid, my hair was pretty fun. My dad would squish a lot of shampoo into it and give me a very impressive Ed Grimley hairdo.  Less fun was the brushing and the styling of the hair, as you see, my dad didn’t know that conditioner existed. Once the old chap figured that one out, the tangles were less tangly and the brushing was more manageable. The ponytails, well, they still were a little tight, pulling my eyes sideways on more than a few occasions, but as Dad would say, “Pain is beauty, beauty pain.”  </p>
<p>Even though he was trying to collect my hair into a quirky side-pigtail just like his favorite female college basketball player, even though he was wearing a pro-woman t-shirt from a feminist rally on the day I was born, even though he was breaking all kinds of gender norms by being my mom AND my dad, there’s still that pesky conditioner that can get in our eyes and in my experience, it’s not the tearless kind.
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Wes Anderson’s latest film, <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>, “emotionally disturbed” 12-year-olds Suzy and Sam run away from their depressing and angst-ridden 1965-era lives to be with each other out in the open air of a New England island.  Their plan doesn’t have much of a future, but the brevity of their escape makes it all the sweeter. Their runaway kingdom doesn’t fall victim to boredom. Its patterns don’t become rote or mechanical. Always on the run, one step ahead of the law and a melodramatic social services worker dressed to vaudevillian villain perfection, our heroic “tweens” hover in a state of latency &#8212; no longer children, but not yet adults.</p>
<p>The film begins with, and keeps returning to, the archetypal flood myth &#8212; Sam first sees Suzy when the latter is playing a raven in a summer production of <em>Noye’s Flood</em>. This mythic story not only drives the plot forward with its promise of a disastrous and world-changing flood/denouement, but it also introduces the themes of coupling, mating, and having sex which will develop into tropes of adulthood. The film is held together by relationships and perspectives &#8212; distances, intimacies, nearness and farness. Sex, though only hinted at cartoonishly by the Noah performance, is prevalent for the older set of characters (a dusty and wrung out crew including Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Bruce Willis). Hardly passionate or even sexy, sex for these grown ups is old and tired, a burdensome secret, an unuttered word separating twin beds.</p>
<p>For Sam and Suzy however, intimacy is king though they do inch closer to becoming sexual beings i.e. adults. Initially avoiding the immediacy of sex, their courtship occurs long distance as they pen letters back and forth to one another. Presented in a montage, we hear their voices speak of the very real and grown-up-sized pain of their otherwise childish lives. They feel cooped up, trapped, bored, lonely.  They don’t play well with others.  Suzy’s parents don’t understand her.  Sam’s parents are dead and he has to make his way through the foster system.  Their insights and advice to one another are at once touchingly appropriate and unintentionally silly.  They are there for one another in genuinely meaningful ways, but they are also very much still children despite the formality of their missives’ greetings and closings. Clearly, they know the patterns of adult relations, but they are still playing in these forms rather than living in them, and the structures remain a bit ill-fitting.</p>
<p>When they run away together, issues of intimacy and adult vs. child continue to unfurl.  Anderson’s camera eye constantly places our little lovers in shots that separate them in perfect symmetry.  Like middle schoolers across the dance floor they are attracted to each other, but scared, unsure &#8212; a mysterious gulf between them.  And both characters seem to be more comfortable with distance.  Suzy is shielded behind her power of quiet sight and her trusty binoculars.  Sam, a seer as well, is a talented painter of “mostly landscapes, some nudes.”  Together they enter a more adult context as a couple against the world that only further highlights how unprepared they are for that adventure.  Their beach blanket makeout scene, for example, is not all that sexy.  Suzy apologizes for the breasts that have not yet made themselves known. Sam spits with an almost too comical “ptooohey” sound after they kiss with tongues &#8212; he had some sand in his mouth.</p>
<p>Still with the adults&#8217; ho-hum lives as a backdrop, the children’s brief escape builds perspective.  We imagine as children that growing up will be an answer that gives us voice and meaning and purpose, but the grown figures in <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> are lost, searching just like the children, differing only in that they are closer to giving up. The children long to be adults. The adults calcifying in their present long to be youthful and effective. The film builds itself through this parallax comparing distance and perspective around that magical turning point of becoming/adult, loss of innocence, Summer’s end, loss of virginity.</p>
<p>Upon going through a commitment ceremony, if not lawful wedding with Sam, Suzy forgets her super power, loses her eyes, by leaving behind her binoculars. If we agree with Freud that there are no accidents, does this mistake show that upon entry into an adult institution Suzy immediately loses her fantasy and her special power? A dark reading at best. However, leaving the binoculars also hinders the couple’s escape, so perhaps the “forgetting” marks Suzy’s desire to linger in childhood a little longer.  Her pretend marriage helping her understand that realistically she needs more time.  The film seems to stay appropriately ambiguous on this point, pushing the boundaries of that in-between a little longer.  All I know is when I left the theater after watching <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> that day, I (30 years old) fell in the parking lot and skinned my knee like I had done so often on elementary school blacktops. This too seemed Freudian, Anderson-esque, and an entirely appropriate epilogue to a movie about how we live through the practice of looking forward and looking back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the perfect time and place to discover <em>Kids in the Hall</em>. In 1990, I was ten years old, and had spent the last three of them insomniac, sneaking downstairs, only sometimes with my mom’s grudging permission, to catch bits of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and <em>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</em>.</p>
<p>It was my introduction to sketch and stand-up comedy. It was funny and sarcastic and risky, but it was also, importantly, grown-up, intelligent, polished. I watched Phil Hartman&#8217;s take on Ronald Reagan, live, peeling away the kindly old wrinkled man who’d been President almost as long as I’d been alive to reveal a diabolical mastermind. It dissolved authority. I didn’t know you were allowed to do that.</p>
<p>I wanted more. On Carson, I’d seen George Carlin do ten minutes of stand-up, and convinced Mom to rent his HBO special <em>What Am I Doing In New Jersey?</em> Carlin’s linguistic freedom and disintegrating precision just blew Dennis Miller’s sarcastic cynicism right out of the water. I also convinced her to rent Spike Lee’s <em>Do the Right Thing</em>. We then made the mistake of watching it with my dad.</p>
<p>One glimpse of Rosie Perez’s chest and Dad declared that I was no longer allowed to go to the video store. PG-13 nudity and jokes about sex or farting in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em> or <em>Blazing Saddles</em> were one thing, but an actual erotic encounter with a foul-mouthed, dark-nippled Puerto Rican girl in a movie that seemed to advocate throwing trash cans through pizzeria windows was simply too much for his ten-year-old son to watch in the family living room with his full knowledge.</p>
<p>Not everyone in the family agreed. Along with taping bootleg cassette copies of a few Public Enemy albums, I probably learned as much listening to my dad and uncle argue about the merits of letting the kids watch <em>Do the Right Thing</em> as I did watching it.</p>
<p>Especially since I’d already had plenty of chances to see exposed nipples, and didn’t know exactly what to do with that exposure anyways. “I just want to see them! And touch them! And some other stuff! And then&#8230; well, I don’t know what happens then!” Is anything quite like that mute adolescent desire?</p>
<p>I knew that there was plenty about the world that I didn’t like &#8212; that things had simply gone very wrong and nobody was willing to say it. I knew I was different from everyone around me at school, who were all navigating ascending puberty by adopting a kind of tribalism of race and gender as certain of its right to bully anyone who seemed different as it was uncertain about everything else. Hip-hop only got me part of the way there. I needed something as smart and broken and skewed and dislocated and new as I felt. And I needed it to be on prime-time broadcast television.</p>
<p>We didn’t have cable, and my parents clamped down on my late-night TV fests, sending me upstairs to read myself to sleep instead. I plowed through paperbacks and old encyclopedias, reading Mark Twain and Dostoyevsky and <em>The Swiss Family Robinson</em> over and over again in torn-cover mass-markets donated to Detroit’s county jail, where Dad worked. In the long run, being condemned to literature was probably a lucky break, too.</p>
<p>TV wasn’t completely lost to me, though. Luckily, I lived in metro Detroit, five big blocks north of the city’s border at 8 Mile Rd, and just a few miles further, over the Ambassador Bridge, the neighboring city of Windsor, Ontario, which broadcast CBC television and radio.</p>
<p>I was at living the border of city and suburb, childhood and adolescence, America and Canada, mainstream and alternative, disaffection and affirmation. So for me in 1990, flipping the knob on my family’s 17” TV and discovering <em>Kids in the Hall</em> on CBC Windsor’s Channel 9 was like wandering into a seedy record shop in 1967 and pulling out <em>The Velvet Underground and Nico</em> from the bins. I wanted to start a band.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I’ve since binged on <em>KitH</em> in waves: first on the CBC in middle school, then in Comedy Central reruns in high school (we got cable! hey!), late-night back-to-back episodes courting a college girlfriend, and again on Netflix today. It’s impossible to list all of the <em>KitH</em> sketches and characters I love, and difficult for me to separate the ones I saw then from those I discovered later.</p>
<p>But I keenly remember Scott Thompson’s Buddy Cole. There are three things that overpower you (or at least overpowered me) about Buddy:</p>
<ol>
<li>His overt sexuality, which I’ll also break down into three parts (little nesting boxes, this): the fact of his homosexuality, his embrace of a gay/queen-ish identity, and his frank discussions of sex itself. (Would I have used those words to describe all those things at ten? No. But I remember all three pieces, because each of them were rare.)</li>
<li>His sheer delight in language, perhaps especially his own. Watch how Buddy doesn’t just craft his words, but reacts to his own jokes and phrases. Listen to Buddy tell a story &#8212; his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4oMe5bPIw">teenage adventures in Montreal</a> are a good start &#8212; and think about how difficult it is to craft a compelling comic sketch that is all words, all third-person, and how effortless and entertaining it is when Buddy does it.</li>
<li>His intelligence, which could just disintegrate you. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite Buddy monologues, from season one:</p>
<blockquote><p>They say&#8230; That blacks are inferior, because they like to dance and screw around. Excuse me? I love to dance. And as far as I&#8217;m concerned, screwing is next to godliness. And I&#8217;m the smartest person I know. They say that orientals are superior, because they&#8217;re better at math and have smaller families. I guess that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s only a billion people in China. I mean I&#8217;m certainly not having any children. Yet I don&#8217;t hear a lot of people running around touting the superiority of faggots&#8230;well, just *me*.</p>
<p>They say that *whites* are *smarter* than blacks, but dumber than orientals. I guess we&#8217;re just right. Hmm? We&#8217;re the porridge that Goldilocks chose. Not too hot, like those saucy Africans, but not too cold like those chilly Chinese. They say that heterosexuals are better than homosexuals, because we&#8217;re so promiscuous. I guess that means we&#8217;re also black. It makes sense, &#8217;cause we can really dance. And boy, do we understand the blues.</p>
<p>People make fun of me because I lisp. Really. Such a lot of fuss over a few extra s&#8217;s. They say that every different group has their own language. For example, fags say things like &#8220;Girl&#8221;, and &#8220;Sister&#8221;, and &#8220;What&#8217;s her problem?&#8221;. Another example, another example, foxy black mamas. They say things like &#8220;Girl&#8221;, and &#8220;Sister&#8221;, and &#8220;What&#8217;s her problem?&#8221;&#8230;makes ya think. And straight men say things like &#8220;No&#8221;, and &#8220;Too expensive&#8221;, and &#8220;Touchdown&#8221;, and &#8220;Scoooooore!&#8221;. They&#8217;re so together.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s recap, shall we? Blacks are inferior because they supposedly commit more crime and test lower on white people&#8217;s I.Q. tests. I don&#8217;t know about you, but if I was raised in the ghetto, I&#8217;d be out there ripping off whitey and forgetting the capital of Maine. And orientals aren&#8217;t supposed to be as sexually driven as blacks or whites. Hmm, I guess all those tourists who flock to the flesh pots of Bangkok are there for the food. And blacks, because they apparently have larger than usual genitalia, are called stupider. And orientals, because they supposedly have smaller than usual genitalia, are called *smarter*, not cheated. And whites again have perfect wieners and buns. I guess we&#8217;re just smart enough. Smart enough to stay out of trouble, but too dumb to run convenience stores.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what all the fuss is all about, we&#8217;re all just here to find love. I just think the world would be a lot better place if the scientists could keep their slide rules in their pants. It reminds me of something that Yoko Ono once said to Malcolm X in a bistro in Rome. &#8220;Oh the food&#8217;s terrible. But the waiter&#8217;s hilarious.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No trash cans through the window, but he leaves you demolished all the same.</p>
<p>The literary references make no sense, which became a running gag in Buddy’s sketches. It always seems like a joke he’s making only for himself. And that was the point. Buddy is smarter than you. Buddy is always in control. As Scott Thompson says, Buddy was an “alpha queen.” When it’s time to close the bar, he’ll burn the fucking thing down.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Sound of Young America’s Jesse Thorn, Scott Thompson elaborates on <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/scott-thompson-actor-and-comedian-kids-hall-interview-sound-young-america" target="_blank">how radical and unwelcome this was, even to gay audiences</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was very aware that I was out there almost alone, and I knew that I was breaking new ground which can be very exciting, but also can be very painful. I was shocked at the negativity that I got from people, particularly gay men. I got an awful lot of grief from gay men during that time&#8230;</p>
<p>It was mostly really queenie guys that were most upset with me. They were like, I can’t believe that you’re always playing gay men like that; I think it’s very insulting and stereotypical. I would be like, why don’t you play your voice in a tape recorder and listen to it, because they’re ridiculous. People were in denial. It was such a polarized time. AIDS was ravaging the gay community, so there was no room for humor. Everything was so deadly serious and earnest and it was life and death, and I think I was seen by a large proportion of the gay community, particularly the Mandarins &#8212; and I love to use that word &#8212; who lorded over the movement as sell out, or the Uncle Tom, or the enemy.</p>
<p>To this day it’s still painful for me, because for me I’m like, wait a second, what’s wrong with being effeminate, number one, and number two, lots of gay men are effeminate! It’s crazy! No matter how many weights you lift, you still carry your books like a girl. Grow up! Get a grip! Accept it! I think people were in such a &#8212; it was such a terrible time that Buddy Cole was seen as the enemy. At least Buddy is sexual, he was not neutered, he was never a neutered gay guy. And he was smart! He’s smarter than I am. That queen up until then &#8212; they were always stupid and you laughed at them, and you never laughed at Buddy, Buddy was always in control. He was an alpha queen. I couldn’t understand it; to this day I think they were dead wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t be a queen like Buddy &#8212; I knew I was hopelessly condemned to teenage heterosexuality long before Rosie Perez publicly confirmed it &#8212; and I couldn’t be Canadian. But then, I couldn’t be as smart, as charitable, as self-controlled, or as fearless as he was either. But those virtues, at least, were something I could work on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beverages have represented different things to me at various times in my life, and I find that my drink preferences can be easily broken down into clearly defined eras, each with its own, distinctive needs. Those needs were not always satiated, but boy, it didn’t stop me from trying using whatever was sloshing around in my glass.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy damsel: the early years</strong></p>
<p>Like most children, I drank cows’ milk. But growing up in Wisconsin, the land of milk and cheese, I drank it constantly &#8212; with meals and in-between. I lived a stone’s-throw from a number of dairy farms, and my local high school ran a yearly “bring your tractor to school day” for the Future Farmers of America students. The dairy farm nearest to my home also had veal cows penned right up against the road, where everyone could see. I saw tethered, baby veal cows most days of my first eighteen years of life.</p>
<p>During my childhood and adolescence, rBGH &#8212; also known as &#8220;recombinant bovine growth hormone&#8221; &#8212; was plentiful, unregulated, and pumped into milk at a record rate. I was consuming a great ton of milk then, and now I have a milkmaid figure and endometriosis. Just kidding &#8212; I’m sure neither is related. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>A fish called Wanda: the boozy years</strong></p>
<p>I was already a few years into sewing my recreational oats via other substances when something as unremarkable as alcohol began subverting it&#8217;s way into my repertoire with increasing rotations. I accessed it by the typical, teenage avenues at my disposal because I was eighteen; an age sometimes quite crudely referred to as &#8220;not old enough to drink, but old enough to swallow.&#8221; Soon I was chasing the day when I&#8217;d be able to down liquor that was not stolen, swindled, or combined from the ends of other people&#8217;s discarded drinks. In the meantime, I decided that drinking something I had just picked cigarette butts out of was part of my charm, and became a scavenger-goat for alcohol &#8212; a remora and bottom-feeder feasting on the booze scraps that of-age sharks had lost track of or left behind. When I had a choice or had convinced some poor sod to buy the man’s-ruin-fluid on my behalf, I opted for Bud Light, leaving me more calories for food, or Mad Dog, leaving me more money for things like gasoline and film developing. (These were the days before digital cameras.) By the time I moved on to straight vodka, whiskey and rum, I was almost old enough to buy it myself.</p>
<p>Eventually the way that I was drinking became less endearingly ribald and more&#8230; abject. So now I buy alcohol only infrequently, and then opt for indie beer with fancy labels, like a good little hipster. Although I will say that <em>Idler</em> music columnist and good buddy Mike Vincent recently turned me on to Dogfish brand beer, which is a slice of beer-heaven.</p>
<p><strong>Working stiff: the retail years</strong></p>
<p>So. Much. Coffee. This is when espresso finally made it to the midwest, so in fueling my lowly bookstore-assistant-manager positions, I graduated from giant, refillable styrofoam McDonald’s coffees to caffeine-loaded froo-froo drinks that came in matte, brown cups with the little corrugated condom-jackets. Somewhere along the way I switched back to plain black coffee again which was 1.) free at the independent bookstore I finally ended up at, and 2.) low-calorie, to correspond with the eating disorder I had developed not long after I stopped drinking like a sad lounge-singer.</p>
<p>In mid-high school, putting sugar and cream in my truck stop coffee like a silly, innocent teenager had been part of the fun in drinking it while I sat across from my friend <a href="http://theprojekt.artsprojekt.com/post/7655866383/artist-proof-interview-with-artist-kelly" target="_blank">Kelly Howlett</a> (who is now a painter and teacher), agreeing that being part of a creative community like the Beats would be totally swell. Cream and sugar lost their allure around the same time food did, and even though I now eat like a regular lady, I never really regained my taste for sweetened coffee. I still like my coffee black and bitter like a punch in the face &#8212; a reminder of where I came from, and the things I was forced to abandon to survive. Leave me my bitter coffee, oh irresponsiblity and excess, for you have already robbed me of so much.   </p>
<p><strong>Today and tonight: the writing years</strong></p>
<p>The combination of a slipshod lifestyle, a slavish debt to old demons, inherited predispositions and a wussy constitution has left me with rather cry-baby adrenals at age 34. I still drink coffee, but it’s a dysfunctional relationship to encourage. If I drink it, I don’t sleep. In fact, it’s 7:45 a.m. as I write this, and I haven’t been to bed yet tonight (uh, this morning?). I even took a little Rx downer at midnight to help motivate me to become tired, but I’m afraid that’s worn off now since it’s only supposed to last about six hours. Staying up all night to work is all too tempting when it’s work you care about, and when the words are coming easily like a new lover who thinks you’re something special.</p>
<p>When I am being responsible, I drink tea. It’s the perfect balance to give me enough pep to avoid passing out into my soup like a blitzed Montgomery Clift, but not so much that I stay up until eight a.m. trying to write my way out of whatever box I imagine I’m in. Fortunately, I love tea. When I was writing my novel <em>Basajaun</em>, I would drink a pot of green tea steadily throughout the day, and it kept me literarily lubricated and balanced, yet muted enough to remain still and produce. I view green tea as magical writing elixir, but for it to function effectively, I have to go into the day fresh, having slept the night before. That’s the bit that’s the stickler. When it gives you temporary results, it’s all too easy to pump your body with delicious, face-punching black coffee all for the sake of accomplishing work or avoiding the night. For Winkin’, Blikin’ and Nod &#8212; those rogue denizens of sleep &#8212; may not be as friendly when you’re heavily caffeinated.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I got sucked into Waters' work and manifesto at the age of seventeen, and in his books <em>Shock Value</em> and <em>Crackpot</em> I first learned all the infamous anecdotes devoured by other Waters fans long before me, including the one Waters himself now is cheerfully weary of telling years later (you know the one), but which new generations of fans love him for as soon as they discover his world. He still tells it though, because he is just that gracious, along with all the other great stories about how Divine escaped arrest in a gold lamé toreador outfit, about Edith Massey's thrift store, Elizabeth Coffey's mid-gender-reassignment nude scene and the burning of the Pink Flamingos trailer. Oh, and how Divine ate dog feces on film under Waters' direction (that's the one!); something Waters says he could never live up to and Divine could never live down.

But you already know all those stories. The behind the scenes DIY-ness and mania of the 1970s and 80s Waters-filmmaking-family has been meticulously chronicled, re-chronicled, poured-over and revered. Nothing about those crazy, intoxicating, renegade years was left out. Except one thing&#8212;one noticeable, unshared topic-hole in the works written by and about the filmmaker.

John Waters never spoke much about his personal life.

<p>I got sucked into Waters&#8217; work and manifesto at the age of seventeen, and in his books <em>Shock Value</em> and <em>Crackpot</em> I first learned all the infamous anecdotes devoured by other Waters fans long before me, including the one Waters himself now is cheerfully weary of telling years later (you know the one), but which new generations of fans love him for as soon as they discover his world. He still tells it though, because he is just that gracious, along with all the other great stories about how Divine escaped arrest in a gold lamé toreador outfit, about Edith Massey&#8217;s thrift store, Elizabeth Coffey&#8217;s mid-gender-reassignment nude scene and the burning of the Pink Flamingos trailer. Oh, and how Divine ate dog feces on film under Waters&#8217; direction (that&#8217;s the one!); something Waters says he could never live up to and Divine could never live down.</p>
<p>But you already know all those stories. The behind the scenes DIY-ness and mania of the 1970s and 80s Waters-filmmaking-family has been meticulously chronicled, re-chronicled, poured-over and revered. Nothing about those crazy, intoxicating, renegade years was left out. Except one thing—one noticeable, unshared topic-hole in the works written by and about the filmmaker.</p>
<p>John Waters never spoke much about his personal life. I don&#8217;t mean so much the absence of a bedpost-notch sort of laundry list, but while Waters has always been delightfully candid about how he views the world around him, he has said less regarding how he feels about how this world views him. And I don&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that either. Waters is sharp, engaging, savvy—and private. I respected him for it; he clearly had great self-control to resist the celebrity urge-to-purge.</p>

<p>And <em>Role Models</em> is by no means a purge; it&#8217;s smart, savvy and tasteful. Restrained. It goes only inches into the director&#8217;s personal life, which is no doubt miles deep like anyone&#8217;s, but it&#8217;s inches more than he has shared before. The revelations are peppered sparingly throughout the volume, and perhaps none are more significant than those shared in the chapter about Tennessee Williams. Waters has professed his fandom of the iconic playwright before, but hearing a more in depth Waters-on-Williams (no pun intended) is a special treat, and more, when Waters talks about how Williams helped him feel less isolated in his own sexuality.</p>
<p>Waters first began reading Tennessee Williams at age twelve when he stole Williams&#8217; short story collection <em>One Arm</em> from his local library, because the late-1950s &#8216;See librarian&#8217; status of the book didn&#8217;t allow him access to checking it out. As an adolescent, Waters said Tennessee Williams &#8216;saved his life&#8217;, by being &#8220;joyous, alarming, sexually confusing and dangerously funny&#8221;. &#8220;Tennessee Williams let me know early… through reading,&#8221; Waters said on NPR, &#8220;… that there was another world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Years later, Tennessee Williams saved my life again,&#8221; Waters says in Role Models.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first time I went to a gay bar when I was seventeen years old. …it was filled with early-1960s gay men in fluffy sweaters who cruised one another by calling table-to-table on phones provided by the bar. &#8220;I may be queer but I ain&#8217;t this,&#8221; I remember thinking. Still reading everything Tennessee Williams wrote, I knew he would understand my dilemma. Tennessee never seemed to fit the gay stereotype even then… Tennessee Williams wasn&#8217;t a gay cliche, so I had the confidence to try not to be one myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>Waters taught in prisons in the 80s, and <em>Role Models</em> also goes more in depth about his views on criminal rehabilitation, which are fascinating to read about whether you agree with him or not. Particularly interesting is his debate on the ethics of punishment vs. law, where he asks whether the justified passion of the public against a criminal should supersede the laws that dictate paroleability based on precedented incarceration caps of reformation, behavior and time. This idea of forgivable vs. unforgivable is also touched on as Waters shares his feelings about organized religion and his Catholic upbringing, as well as what it was like for him to learn more about the backgrounds of some of his own, unsung misfit heroes from the way-underground adult entertainment industry—especially when these backgrounds were less admirable than he would&#8217;ve hoped.</p>
<p><em>Role Models</em> is a window into a current, more mature Waters. But unlike the retrospective attitudes of many iconoclastics who backpedal as soon as they hit 60 and are faced with their own mortality and accountability, <em>Role Models</em> is not repentative (anything but), and not latently whitewashed (anything but!), but contemplative. More complex, thoughtful and intro-and-extrospective, it shows Waters as as a wonderfully detailed, slow-cooked, more fully-realized version of himself.</p>

<p>John Waters is still the most vulgar polite person and the most polite vulgar person in the world; perhaps even moreso today. It&#8217;s amazing the balance he is able to maintain fostering unabashed, rebellious independence all while presenting an inviting, nurturing warmth that offers comfort to some of the most marginalized groups in society. Heavy or conventionally &#8220;unattractive&#8221; teens and adults, dissident gay men, soft straight men, ferocious and victimized women, racial minorities of all types, the pursued, the bullied, the abused, the extremely shy and the extremely awkward all have a place to thrive in his world. Waters inspires people to adapt the coping mechanisms he himself employed to survive, a &#8220;take-lemons-and-make-lemonade&#8221; approach to not only to the arts—whether through creative experimentation or by balking the conventions of perceived artistic legitimacy—but also to life and to self-esteem. He preaches that the very worst things about you, the things that make you feel ugly, disliked and alone, may be your best qualities, if you let them. Be proud of yourself, because there&#8217;s someone else out there feeling ugly, disliked and alone too. Maybe they wrote a book you can read.</p>
<p>Or maybe you can write a book to be read by them.</p>
