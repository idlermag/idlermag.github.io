										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as a nonfiction writer, I’ve already managed to lie to you before I even start. Quit cooking, start reading is not quite true &#8212; I pretty much never stop reading. Not to eat, brush my teeth, not even when cleaning the kitchen or taking a walk. I read my way through the winter hibernation and through the summer vacations. Whenever I fly, I carry 2-3 books on the plane with me because I’m too cheap for an e-reader and because I’m likely to get through at least two. The back problems are totally worth it.</p>
<p>One of my professors sent me the reading list for my fall literature class ahead of time so that we can go ahead and get started. A cooler person than me might have been dismayed, but it made me thrilled to start school. Partly, I was psyched because I’d already read some of the things on the list, which made me feel educated as hell. And that meant I could reread them, actually remember them, and maybe think of some smart shit to say ahead of time in class. (But not too many smart things &#8212; no one wants to be THAT girl, and I don’t want to be shunned at the after-class happy hour.) I’ve already started rereading Nabokov’s <em>Lolita</em>, and have been keeping a list of the beautiful and inventive language he uses so that I can try to learn something while I limp along in my novicehood.</p>
<p>For example: “. . . a poplar playing its liquid shadows all over the local Honor Roll” (p. 137); the backyard with “apple-green light” (p. 31); Lolita with “all four limbs starfished” across the chair (p. 174). Oh dear, I got too Englishy. But if you can’t appreciate the gorgeous prose, then I probably can’t appreciate you. I’m also excited to reread Raymond Carver’s short stories “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” and “Beginners.”</p>
<p>I expect to probably be cooking much less when I’m in school, and writing to you about the best ways to jazz up rice and beans, writing a treatise on the various forms of caffeine, or on the best way to discreetly drink wine during workshop. But before I do all of that, I’m headed back to Michigan with my dad’s side of the family and Charlie to go up north to one of my most favorite places.</p>

<p>We all spend a ton of time reading up there, moving from the hammock to the dock, to the pontoon, to a lawn chair, and back to the hammock again. My dad reads exactly one book a year. He always reads it up north, and it’s always about music. Last year I let him borrow my copy of Steve Almond’s book <em>Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life</em>, with its companion playlist. The year before that, he read Keith Richards’s <em>Life</em>, and read aloud anecdotes about prostitutes and drug cocktails. The year before that, it was Alice Cooper’s book <em>Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roller&#8217;s 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict</em> (which is actually pretty hilarious).</p>
<p>For me, I found a used book at the lovely <a href="http://www.greenapplebooks.com/" target="_blank">Green Apple Books</a> called <em>Not for Bread Alone: Writers on Food, Wine, and the Art of Eating</em>, edited by Daniel Halpern. It’s a collection of food writing from well-known writers, including Wendell Berry, Charles Simic, Joyce Carol Oates, and Francine Prose, among others. Before I get started with classes and get buried under class readings, I’m bringing that one up north, along with Julia Child’s <em>My Life in France</em>, which was given to me as a gift and I MUST READ before I lose all steam.</p>
<p>Reading while lying in the sun and/or eating is one of the things I enjoy most. I wish you all a happy summer, and happy reading!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My enthusiasm is usually a good sign that something is on the way out, and in fact by the time you read this, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History will have started to take down its display of Julia Child&#8217;s kitchen. Originally planned for an 18-month exhibition in 2002, and tucked away out of sight in the museum&#8217;s basement, Child&#8217;s kitchen has been so popular that it&#8217;s been on display for nearly ten years. Even now, elements from the kitchen will be incorporated into a new display <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/julia-childs-kitchen-to-close-temporarily-on-sunday/2012/01/03/gIQA84PdcP_blog.html" target="_blank">&#8220;about big changes in what we ate in the last half of the 20th century.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I am excited about the new exhibit, but I&#8217;m not immune to the lure of a pilgrimage, and I wanted to see the kitchen in it&#8217;s original(ish) state before it gets repurposed.</p>

<p>Julia Child is one of my cooking heroes. She&#8217;s a food icon in the U.S., but unlike most contemporary celebrity chefs, she was never a restauranteur. For all practical purposes, she didn&#8217;t even start cooking until her mid-30s &#8212; and you really should read her accounts of her disastrous first efforts in her memoir <em>My Life in France</em>. Child was, however, a force of nature. When she devoted herself to a task, she was unstoppable. Through hard work and force of will, she graduated from France&#8217;s Le Cordon Bleu cooking school &#8212; you should also read about Child&#8217;s struggles with the school&#8217;s headmistress, Madame Brassart &#8212; and almost immediately set to the task which would in one fashion or another consume the rest of her life, teaching beginners how to start cooking well.</p>
<p>This devotion to beginners and Child&#8217;s irrepressible <em>joie de vivre</em> are the secrets of her enduring popularity. <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> is famously written &#8220;for the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children&#8217;s meals, the parent-chauffeur-den-mother syndrome, or anything else which might interfere with the enjoyment of producing something good to eat.&#8221; Even that &#8220;on occasion&#8221; is essential. Child and her co-authors aren&#8217;t writing for people who <em>never</em> have to worry about money, waistlines, or children. Instead, Child is imagining the audience for her book as people like herself &#8212; people who are perhaps not (yet) accomplished cooks, but who want to eat and cook just a little better than they otherwise might, and just need a supportive teacher to help them get there.</p>
<p>And Child was born to be that teacher, telling us that it was okay if things didn&#8217;t quite go right, that it&#8217;s good to stretch ourselves in the kitchen. It&#8217;s not as hard as it seems, and, even better, it&#8217;s worth the time and the effort you put in. And perhaps best of all, we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of using too much butter.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more than a little evidence of Child&#8217;s impact even today. Her <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> is still on bookstore shelves next to the <em>Joy of Cooking</em> that Child so revered. (There are two &#8212; count &#8217;em, two &#8212; copies of <em>Joy</em> on the shelf in Child&#8217;s kitchen.)</p>

<p>There are two volumes of Child&#8217;s <em>The French Chef</em> available on DVD, and you can still catch reruns of Child&#8217;s later series <em>Baking with Julia</em> on PBS. The latter was filmed in the 1990s, and Child is mostly an observer and kitchen assistant to the featured cooks. She&#8217;s much older than her <em>French Chef</em> days, with a pronounced stoop in her back, but the voice and personality are still there, and you can still catch her dipping her fingers in the chocolate if you pay attention.</p>
<p>There was of course, far more to Child than her cooking. If you dig a little deeper you&#8217;ll find that she was struggling with alcoholism during her <em>French Chef</em> days, and it&#8217;s tempting to attribute her <em>bonhomie</em>, as well as that famous dropped chicken, to the drinking. But it&#8217;s never really as simple as that. When Child escaped the bottle, she was still the same Julia, and it&#8217;s possible to watch her lifetime behind the camera and never dream that her struggles were so severe.</p>

Hidden among all the pots, pans, and knives in Julia&#8217;s kitchen is Child&#8217;s government-issue &#8220;emergency signal mirror,&#8221; a relic of her World War II service in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services" target="_blank">Office of Strategic Services</a> in China. There is debate even today over whether Child herself or the man she met during her service and eventually married were ever spies themselves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible to eat well, to cook well, something really special every once in a while, and to be totally, completely awesome even if you never, ever let anyone know.</p>
<p>Child kept her OSS signal mirror in the junk drawer in her kitchen until the day she donated the room to the Smithsonian. As of yesterday, at least, they were still together.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why Child always had a smile on her face. And if Julia was imagining writing for an audience like herself, then maybe we can imagine ourselves to be a little more like her as well. Maybe getting to know the kitchen a little better can mean being a little bit more awesome too.</p>
