<blockquote><p>“He’s got a mean streak,” says his manager, Sparky Anderson. “As mean as Pete Rose. That’s saying the best thing that could be said about a ballplayer.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of weak aspects to my game – hence hiring a coach to convert me into a real, badass third baseman, aka #Project3B.</p>
<p>But despite <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/11/02/project-3b/">my affinity for miming the Rocky training sequence</a>, my adoration of <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/26/suggested-halloween-costumes-for-my-party-saturday-baseball-playoffs-edition/">complete badasses like Brian Wilson</a>, and my freakish ability <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/motheroflight/status/29592060227">to not notice somewhat hardcore injuries until well after the fact</a>, I still have a hard time with my game face.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I convinced (read: asked a few times, sweetly) my best friend Debbie, to join me in my #Project3B shenanigans. Of course, I had ulterior motives, including expanding the range of awesome milady performs on the field this summer. </p>
<p>Whereas the first lesson, I was Too. Fucking. Exhausted. to perform my standard “can’t go more than five minutes without cracking jokes” act (at least they’re funny, I’m told), Debbie’s presence was fabulous in a few awesome ways. First, I wasn’t the only one performing the drills, so I wasn’t So. Fucking. Exhausted. so fast. (Also, we learned that Debbie has a wicked arm and can field well. Holla, all-girl infield!)</p>

<p><strong>Coach</strong>: “Don’t get lazy, A, keep your ass down!”<br />
<strong>Angela</strong>: Fields grounder (barely), mutters under breath, “That’s what she said.”<br />
<strong>Debbie</strong>: (Quietly) Actually, that’s what he said.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah. Maybe it’s conditioned, partly, in girls&mdash;even girls like me, who regularly wear 3 to 4-inch heels, drink scotch, smoke cigars and are told by male friends, “You’re like a man in a hot chick’s body”&mdash;to take direction well from men with authority but feel the need to offset it with a giggle.</p>
<p>(I have also been known to respond to internal work emails with a well-timed “That’s what she said” as well.)</p>
<p>But it all begs the question: can I become a great (or hell, just plain better than 80% of my competitors) co-ed beer-league softball infielder if I can’t be “mean” like Gibby&mdash;if I’m more likely to bite my cheeks to keep from guffawing when my coach, fixing my swing (another catastrophe, to be explored next week) says, “Don’t get stiff too early?”</p>
<p>I don’t know what it all means, kids. I don’t know how long it’s going to take for me to be more “Hearts on Fire” and less Weird Al’s “I’m Fat,” but it’s safe to say it’s more than two sessions with the coach. Whose nice silver watch, incidentally, helps me focus when I’m trying to override my inane urges. </p>
<p>(That’s what she said.)</p>

<p>It was a piece of notebook paper. It was a little damp &#8212; Ronnie had ferreted it away in his palm after dinner; his mother would not allow it out of the house.</p>
<p>It was a piece of paper signed by Sparky Anderson. The lines of the paper, the scratchy black of what had to have been a Bic medium point ballpoint pen cresting and peaking over the hills and valleys formed when he signed the paper against Ronnie&#8217;s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t kiss Ronnie then &#8212; there was a crucifix on the wall behind us, and Father Erpelding was walking the halls, smoking his pipe. But I knew, in that moment, I&#8217;d been right to let him put his lips on mine in first grade, even if my mother did find out and chastise me, even if my mother didn&#8217;t think it was funny when Ronnie and I glued our hands together with Elmer&#8217;s (we removed the orange cap) in protest.</p>
<p>How precious was that paper! We insisted the church secretary, Mrs. Cassar, make a Xerox copy for us; I kept that faux-Sparky autograph for years. It stayed on the dresser next to my bed even after Ronnie moved away (I remember he told me he was switching schools while we shared the strawberries his mother packed in his metal lunchbox), even after the baseball strike, after all my dogs died and I grew my hair long and then cut it short and then left for college.</p>
<p>Sparky, we know, is dying &#8212; not in that existential, postmodern sense. He is really dying.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember when I realized I&#8217;d lost the autograph. But I&#8217;m certain I wasn&#8217;t sad.</p>
<p>The scrap of paper was a talisman. Once, I hit two triples in a game and saw my name in the local paper the next. I touched the paper again before the next game, and stuck out looking twice.</p>
<p>The scrap of paper was not magic. The name on it was.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because of Sparky Anderson that Jim Leyland wears cleats in the dugout. It&#8217;s because of Sparky Anderson that we now have a battery of bullpen pitchers, from Brian Wilson to Joel Zumaya to the nameless workhorses taking the ball in the third inning. It&#8217;s because Kirk Gibson sulked into Sparky&#8217;s office, intent on kicking his ass after being benched, and got his ass kicked instead, that the Tigers became a team of winners (before becoming a team of losers). It&#8217;s because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Gibson" target="_blank">Sparky did this in Game 5 of the 1984 series </a>that I knew, even as an elementary schooler, that his name on paper was precious:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the <em><a title="Sounds of the Game (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sounds_of_the_Game&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Sounds of the Game</a></em> video, Detroit manager <a title="Sparky Anderson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparky_Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a> was seen in the dugout, yelling at Gibson, <em>&#8220;He don&#8217;t want to walk you!&#8221;</em> and making a bat-swinging motion with his hands, the universal baseball gesture for &#8220;swing away.&#8221; Gibson got the message, and launched Gossage&#8217;s 1-0 fastball deep into <a title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Stadium_(Detroit)">Tiger Stadium</a>&#8216;s right field upper deck for a three-run homer, icing the game and the Series for the Tigers.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://multimedia.detnews.com/pix/photogalleries/sportsgallery/sparkyanderson/index21.html" target="_blank">because Sparky wore batting gloves</a> on his hands when he argued with umpires.</p>
<p>﻿It&#8217;s because he insisted that every one of his players was better than Mickey Mantle, or Johnny Bench &#8212; it&#8217;s because, growing up in the shadow of Sparky&#8217;s foot hitched up on the dugout steps, we all thought we could be legends, too.</p>
<p>None of that was on the bit of paper. And none of it, really, can be lost.</p>
