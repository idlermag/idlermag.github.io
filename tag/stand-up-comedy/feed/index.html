										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know Nick Offerman as the straightforward, bacon-eating, curmudgeon, Ron Swanson, of NBC’s <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. He’s made quite a name for himself there playing the role of a strictly anti-government parks worker to deadpan perfection. Reaching the heights of pop cultural iconography, his Swansonisms sprawl across the internets and he’s won the masses over with his affectless stoicism, the charm of one eyebrow raised ever so slightly. But like his lovely wife before him, Megan Mullally, who played the fantabulously drevil (drunk and evil) Karen Walker on <em>Will and Grace</em>, it’s become easy to equate the actor with their most famous role. Though Swanson and Offerman do share a lot in common (meat hankerings, saxophone playing, finely groomed mustaches) there are many faces to Offerman that you may not have seen yet. </p>
<p>Having read a number of Offerman interviews and articles, I knew that he was a legit farm boy who then studied stage acting and excelled not only at his theatrical craft, but also in the crafting of sets and costumes. Though he has lots of Hollywood experience, he also feels at home performing Kabuki theater and abstract postmodernist plays. He makes silly music videos with his wife and runs a serious carpentry business where he builds beautiful furniture and seaworthy canoes. Quite a talented grab bag, this fella. That being said, I wasn’t exactly sure what I’d signed up for by purchasing a ticket to <em>American Ham</em>, Offerman’s one-man show. </p>
<p>Well, last Friday night I plopped myself down in my folding chair in the Royal Oak theater &#8212; close enough to be giddy, far away enough that I couldn’t easily storm the stage (you’re welcome, Nick). No opening act, no announcer, no muss no fuss, Nick Offerman sauntered on stage with that trademarked direct stare and downturned grumpy cat mouth. Shirtless, wearing jeans and a guitar strapped to his bod, he made his way to the mic, offered a brisk hello and promptly put on a denim stars and stripes shirt. Our semi-nudity for the night complete, he got down to business. </p>
<p>The next couple hours consisted of spoken word and sometimes musical didacticism &#8212; a fine marriage of honesty, humor, and personal philosophy. Like the traveling Chatauqua shows of the early 21st century, his show is a kind of educational entertainment for adults. Though he begins by espousing Biblical teachings the ilk of “Do unto others,” he also heartily deconstructs “The Good Book” claiming that <em>The Hobbit</em> is also a good book that is far more consistent. (Offerman knows a lot about elves and wizards and things &#8212; a fun nerd surprise). He unpacks the importance of engaging in romantic love, no matter what your sexual preference, and exposes the ridiculous sexism of the Bible’s male writers who helped solidify a culture of woman fear and woman hating. I liked this part a lot. Any man who reminds his peers that menstruation is not disgusting or unclean gets a high-five from this gal. Beyond this, he discusses the value of “please and thank you,” the power of hard work, and good drugs (used responsibly, of course). He urged us be in nature, avoid the pitfalls of the mirror (our flaws are not as awful as advertisers claim), and he strongly suggested that we pick up a hobby, develop a discipline, find passion for a craft and the honing of it. Oh, and always carry a handkerchief to wipe a sweaty brow, politely blow one’s nose, or apply a tourniquet to a bleeding neighbor’s flesh wound. </p>
<p>Offerman is clearly a man who delights in words, multisyllable ones and curse words alike. He takes pleasure in speaking slowly and picking the appropriate term for the situation, likes the feel of a complex notion taking shape on his tongue. But perhaps best of all, his calm, measured lecturing is easily broken by a mischievous giggle that bubbles up out from under his mustache at odd intervals. The crowd could not help but burst into laughter in response every time. </p>
<p>Was there some Ron Swanson in there? Definitely, but not too much. <em>American Ham</em> was very much about balance. It showed me that Nick Offerman has delighted in being both a stalwart American man &#8212; a quiet, tree-hewing, meat-grilling sort, but also the gentle idiot, the ham who plays and wants to be seen playing, the kind of man who hand-makes cards for his “sweet stack of curves” wife along with the dorkiest loving song about how hard he’s gonna do her. Likewise, though his show takes us back in time to a simpler, plainer form of entertainment, it is good and hearty fare. See the show, go outside, make a craft. Those Ron Swanson gifs will still be there when you get back, and if Offerman is right, they’ll be all the sweeter once you’ve earned them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Schumer’s first hour-long special, “Mostly Sex Stuff,” recently aired on Comedy Central. I’ve read some negative reviews claiming that she’s just another typical female comedian, oversexed, and too caught up in talking about dating, but I tend not to agree. One brilliant internet dude claims that we shouldn’t bother with Amy because if we’ve seen Chelsea Handler’s, Natasha Legerro’s, or Whitney Cumming’s acts we’ve seen Schumer’s. Because women are all the same. The fellas from the <em>Never Not a Nerd Show</em> explain that there are women who are funny socially or as writers, but as one nerd put it, “I’ve never seen stand-up from a woman that’s not “here’s me banging dudes. . .” and “being a girl is hard and vaginas are weird &#8212; that’s the other thing they [female stand-ups] have.” I’d like to go on the record with my own little review because men aren’t the only ones who can plaster their opinions all over the internet. And also because my opinions are better.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10416" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10416" data-attachment-id="10416" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/22/schumer-humor/amyschumer1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg" data-orig-size="330,385" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="amyschumer1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=257" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=330" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=640" alt="Amy Schumer" title="amyschumer1"   class="size-full wp-image-10416" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg 330w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=129 129w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=257 257w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10416" class="wp-caption-text">Amy Schumer</p></div> Ultimately, I thought the show was pretty great and I’m pleased to see that Amy is getting the air-time she deserves. Her persona is sharp as she playfully places a dark edge on her exaggerated and cutesy feminine mannerisms. Schumer’s style is all about inviting us into a familiarly gendered space and then exploding, or at least surprising, us out of it. She chats with her audience as though we are a gaggle of gal pals, and telling us about “mostly sex things” she takes us along on her adventures in dating, relationships, and more casual encounters.  Oozing with sarcasm she lulls everyone into the rhythm of the staid stereotypical (female) stand-up.  “Am I right, ladies?” she asks. When she gets a reaction from the crowd, “Thanks, sister-friends!”  But sandwiched in the “Ohmygawd, I’m a girl!” banter is a joke about being tested for AIDS, or how much of a boundary-blind cunt her mom is, or the time her boyfriend wanted to discuss the possibility of bringing assplay into their bedroom. I believe that last joke ended with her calling his bluff, his delicately placing one finger atop her anus, and her giving him the fisting of a lifetime. Yeah. And then she giggles, makes dolly eyes, and twirls her hair a bit.  I love it.  </p>
<p>Though her hour-long show sagged a bit in parts, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her observations, stories, or subject matter. Rather, it seems she has a unique rhythm and her strengths lie in her bracketed offbeats on the way to telling a larger joke. Let me explain what I mean, here. With the fisting joke, the punchline comes quite appropriately with the fisting, but she goes on to give some extra info &#8212; “He’s dead now.” That little line is so powerful. It’s unnecessary, but its excessiveness builds the enjoyment of the previous joke. Likewise, when she’s telling a tale about a man commenting on her “sturdy” build, she parenthetically adds, “He was from Texas. . . or some place I’m not going.”  These little extras, these bits of information that distract from the main focus, can add to the realistic feel of listening to a friend chatting while further playing up her critique of the “privileged white girl” character. </p>
<p>Though one could argue that this isn’t really new territory as one-liners were once the comedy norm, the way she weaves a number of tight and punchy one-liners into a larger set of more complex stories is impressive and really her own.  What she’s doing with her act is strong, but in an hour-long show all those fragments can create some weird beats and awkward pauses.  Yes, in this special not all of her transitions were exactly seamless, but as a young comic, she’s got plenty of time to perfect her timing and flow and work these issues out.  </p>
<p>If my critical breakdown of Schumer humor sucked the life out of all things comedic, perhaps I can sway you with some of the show’s high points that really worked and tickled my funny bone. </p>
<ul>
<li>On being a child and seeing her mom’s bushy pubic hair situation for the first time: &#8220;Is Mom being swarmed by BEES?&#8221;</li>
<li>On seeing an uncircumcised penis for the first time: (on phone) &#8220;Mom, can you come pick me up? . . . I don’t know &#8212; It’s wearing like a hat, or a cape. . . I don’t know!&#8221;</li>
<li>On using a toilet at a club after she assures us she’s not going to say anything gross: &#8220;So, there I was, just dropping a TON of heat. . . just massacring this bowl. . . I’m texting people, &#8216;Am I DYING?'&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>See?  She’s got the funny. She’s got the chops. She’s got boobs and vag and miraculously these body parts aren’t holding her back.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, the show is worth watching. If you know her work, you’ll see Schumer branching out a bit in places while also honing the voice she’s created. Sure, I’m excited to see her go a little deeper and lend more time to her discussions of class, race, feminism, and stand-up itself, but these things will come with time. I say, don’t listen to the internet guys who suggest you avoid her work for being too girly. (How quickly men forget how often we’ve patiently listened to their sex stories and their detailed depictions of their nether regions.) I say, nut up and imagine what it’s like to have an ovary for a second, fellas. What doesn’t kill you will make you stronger. . . and perhaps more highly educated, and worthier adversaries as fellow nerds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her 2009 comedy album <em>Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome</em>, Maria Bamford prefaces a bit about aging with the following warning: “This joke might fall under the category of something only I enjoy.”  This is one of those cases where it’s funny ‘cause it’s true.  Though I find Bamford’s work hilarious, playful, darkly intelligent, and fun, I’ve noticed that when I try to share her genius with friends I get a less than enthusiastic response.  Think of how people don’t want to try sushi. “Oooh, raw fish? Aah.  Huh. Wrapped in seaweed, too, I see.  No, no, thanks, but you just eat that yourself.”  That face that’s trying to be polite, but disgust is creeping all over their visage.  Their head shaking a “no,” their hand gesturing “halt, there will be no sushi in this gullet!”  This is oftentimes the reaction I get from sharing Maria’s material.  But, to be fair, Bamford (aka The Bammer) isn’t your typical stand-up. If you want simple laughs unpacking the quirky inanity of airplane food, men vs. women, black guys drive like this/white guys drive like this, well, you’ve come to the wrong comedy show.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9856" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/23/keeping-it-weird-a-night-with-maria-bamford/t-70656/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/unwanted-thoughts-syndrome.jpg" data-orig-size="1425,1425" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;T 70656&quot;}" data-image-title="T 70656" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/unwanted-thoughts-syndrome.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/unwanted-thoughts-syndrome.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/unwanted-thoughts-syndrome.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome" title="T 70656" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9856" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/unwanted-thoughts-syndrome.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/unwanted-thoughts-syndrome.jpg?w=600&amp;h=600 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/unwanted-thoughts-syndrome.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> With Maria you get a cacophony of voices each one populating the world around and inside her.  We hear her family, her friends, L.A. rich lady, Mexican neighbor, children at a youth center, the devil, baby Jesus (leaving messages on Mama Bamford’s answering machine), her childish self, her dark self, her anxious self, her feminist self. . . I could go on.  Though one could lazily label her silly, just a weird voice lady, or as one radio deejay so inanely misread her,  a “schizophrenic,” if you listen closely you might hear how her woman of a million voices act quite brilliantly sketches what it feels like to be Maria &#8212; to inhabit her skin, her space, her mind.  And if we’re honest, we might find that all her “weird” characters, offbeat thoughts, songs and reactions are pretty familiar to our own experience.  You know that you at your core?  The one that likes popping zits, eating ice cream for breakfast, narrating the thoughts of your maniacally evil cat in Broadway style with jazz hands and aplomb?  Yeah, that’s the self we usually tidy up and edit out and that’s the one that Maria shares with us in public, on stage.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I actually had the (strange) fangirl pleasure of seeing Maria live in Ann Arbor, MI and it wasn’t exactly what I expected.  First off, I’ve always seen comedians perform in theaters, casino auditoriums, or arenas. The venues seemed to support the idea that the player we came to see was an artist, someone valuable, someone famous, or “big.”  However, the Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase is a lot more like (or at least trying be like) the comedy clubs you’ve seen intermittently on <em>Seinfeld</em> or <em>Louie</em>.  Small cramped quarters. Brick walls. Teeny tiny tables. The audience is ushered in two people to a table and every table is crammed into a semicircular formation around a small spare stage decorated only with a saddish mural of a big city.  The cityscape looks like stage dressing for a high school play.  I could easily walk up to the stage, take the mic, do a jig if I so desired.  There’s none of that spatial separation &#8212; none of those markers that suggest that the performer is not like me, is better.  This makes me sad for Maria.  “She deserves better than this!” my mind screams, and a nervous knot ties in my belly.</p>
<p>I switch seats with my friend Erin &#8212; she joining my husband at a table for two, I filling a half seat next to strangers. And then the fun begins.  A drunk crew of somebody’s moms and dads out for a wild Ann Arbor night squeeze into the spots next to me. The tipsy star of their band immediately starts chatting me up. A woman “alone” at the comedy club &#8212; of course I desire his doting attentions! He entertains, he reads my Facebook phone updates over my shoulder. His wife and friends cheer him on for he’s so funny he should clearly be on stage!  Oh, a laugh riot this guy.  He wants to know is Maria anything like Paula Poundstone?  He likes Paula Poundstone.</p>
<p>Way to know a contemporary female comedian, buddy.  I quietly seethe.</p>
<p>“Nooo, she’s not really your typical stand-up.  She plays a lot with voice work. . .”</p>
<p>“OH, so she does voices.  Can she do Cher?  Sylvester Stallone?”</p>
<p>“No.  Um, she’s not really an impressionist.  She uses the voices to. . .”</p>
<p>“Does she do Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Oh, all right, voices! “</p>
<p>“. . . . . . .”</p>
<p>He went on to showcase his devastating display of comedy knowledge referencing everyone from Sam Kinison to. . . well, Paula Poundstone again.  I went on to call him stupid on Twitter and then concocted elaborate anxiety fantasies of him heckling Bamford, me sitting next to him mouthing to her, “I’m so sorry!”  My stomach at this point was well on its way to cat-o-nine-tails.</p>
<p>The first act was a boring newcomer full of expected and borderline offensive jokes that the old kids sure enjoyed.  Second up was Jackie Kashian &#8212; a friend of Maria’s and strong comedian.  Her work was more story-oriented and built around the ridiculousness of her family, and tales of her nerdish childhood.  Kashian’s style is confident, unshakeably so without being arrogant.  A fine line to walk but she walked it well and all while sporting her Powell’s Books t-shirt.  I liked her.  Dr. Comedy next to me was less pleased but still riding his buzz.</p>
<p>Finally, Maria came on and she was all that I hoped she’d be and more.  The packed closeness that had inspired claustrophobia was now cushioned by loud shared laughter.  The sticky crampedness that built stomach knots gave way into release.  Maybe this layout is part of the build up &#8212; it provides some of the necessary tension that jokes erupt out of, I pondered.  But Maria brought some of this discomfort too.  Her voice could be too quiet, I strained to hear, she babbled her weird thoughts, she’d close her eyes rehearsing what she had told us and what she had yet to say.  One could possibly think she looked unstable or at least fearful, uncomfortable on stage.  There was something true about this but also something that was just part of her performance. I knew she possessed the wherewithal to clean this up, look more “normal” if she wanted to, but she was choosing to show this process as it was.  She does not glibly glide from joke to joke, she gets there messily, truthfully.</p>
<p>But beyond this, I can’t really do her justice as her show relies so heavily on voice and intonation.  For a taste of her sense of humor here’s a story/joke she relayed about a conversation she and her new neighbor shared:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Maria’s new neighbor:</strong> I hope you don’t mind living next to a Mexican &#8212; you know we leave stuff on our lawn.</p>
<p><strong>Maria:</strong> I hope you don’t mind living next to a white lady, because I’m gonna steal that stuff.</p>
<p>MANIFEST DESTINY!  It <em>feels</em> like it’s mine!</p></blockquote>
<p>Old Kinison to my left did not approve.  He was sorry he didn’t get a chance to tell her to her face how badly she sucked.</p>
<p>Erin’s high-pitched laugh squealed behind me. I laughed tearfully.  Maybe she didn’t please everyone that night, but she sure punched some of us right in the comedy gut.</p>
<p>Now, for a comedian to be successful, assuming successful means garnering a wide audience, playing huge theaters, arenas, even, their material needs to hit a sweet spot of broad experience.  It has to fit into, explain and reflect the thoughts, dreams and fears of a good many people.  We tend to mark “the best” by measuring success in this fashion. However, there’s something special about artists like Bamford, performers who refuse to play to the standard and reach every person.  There’s something brave, kinda punk, kinda D.Y.I., feminist awesome about how incredibly close she keeps her comedy.  Her stories all spin out from her unique self and even when she ventriloquizes and lampoons those around her, she maintains the oddity and complexity of her own voice and perspective.  Her show was small, intimate, a little too close and that’s exactly where she’s at home and I felt at home there, too.  She might be too unsettling for even my weird friends, she might not be the next comedy sweetheart to sweep the nation, but she’s honest and amazing in her own right.  She might not steal your heart, but she may steal your stuff. . . and then tell a small crowd a very good story about it.</p>
