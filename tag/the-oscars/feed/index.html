										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have I mentioned that there are too many Best Picture nominees? <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">Has that come up before</a>? I digress. Once again find myself a few movies shy of the full category. And although I did manage to sneak <em>The Help</em> in at the buzzer &#8211; too late for an article &#8211; I was unable to get to<em> Hugo</em>, <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em> (Does having read the book count? And how about if I didn’t like it?) and <em>Warhorse</em>. <em>C&#8217;est la vie</em>.</p>
<p>I had convinced myself pretty early on that this was a bit of a down year. Having seen most of the films now I think that that was an unfair assessment. A few words that come to mind now are charming, insightful, sweet, and nostalgic. This may not have been a “down” year, <em>per se</em>, but it was certainly a pretty mellow one. It should also be noted that these are words one might use to describe a grandparent.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="The Artist" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/TheArtistSq.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Artist</em> wins Best Picture 2012</p></div>
<p>This year’s award show came and went without many surprises.  Out of the films that I did manage to get to I could make a pretty solid argument for at least three of them winning Best Picture, <em>The Artist</em> being one of them. I wouldn’t have minded <em>The Descendants</em> taking it, but I feel like it was too humble to stand out, and <em>The Tree of Life</em> could’ve taken it on sheer scale alone (It’s a film about EVERYTHING!).</p>
<p>All told, I’m happy with most of the victors. It does seem to be a real shame that Viola Davis didn’t take home Best Actress, but she’ll get hers one day. Meryl Streep is certainly one of the best of our time, but I’ve not heard a great many good things about <em>The Iron Lady</em>, and historically speaking acting awards tend to go to great performances in great (or at least very good) films. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/23/147291130/most-oscar-voters-are-white-male-out-of-touch">Perhaps not being entirely on the Academy’s radar demographic-wise</a> hurt Viola a little bit?</p>
<p>And where was the Best Supporting nomination for Albert Brooks in <em>Drive</em>?! Aside from that film being one of my favorites of the year, Brook’s villainy is pretty epic in it and I’m reasonably certain no one would have missed Nick Nolte’s name on that list. He’s very good in <em>Warrior</em>, but let’s face it; he’s played that character before.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest travesty for me, though, was the fact that <em>The Tree of Life’s</em> cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, didn’t go home with the gold. Yes, <em>Hugo</em> looks amazing, but I have never seen a film that looks or feels anything like <em>The Tree of Life</em>. Never. I don’t know about you, but I can’t think of a better impetus for handing someone an award.</p>
<p>It’s funny, this year I didn’t find myself terribly concerned about missing the few Best Picture noms that I did. Would I have rather seen <em>Hugo</em> than <em>The Help</em> (my wife is largely responsible for that)? Absolutely. But do I feel that I’ve missed out on <em>Extremely Loud</em> and <em>Warhorse</em>? Not really. Which brings us full circle: Were their really nine films worthy of being considered Best Picture? Can anyone give me a solid reason why <em>Extremely Loud</em>, a film hovering just under 50% on rottentomatoes.com, was even mentioned in the same breath as some of these other films? Oh well, it’s all over and done with now. And I’m reasonably certain that I’ll have another opportunity to rail on about this again next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignright" title="The Artist poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/the-artist-poster-wins__oPt.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="324" />The Artist</em> is a much cheekier film than I had expected going in, because as much as it strives for (and attains) authenticity it also spends a good deal of time winking at those who don’t like (or at least think they don’t like) silent films.</p>
<p>Its story is a sort of mash-up of <em>Singing in the rain</em> (1952) and <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> (1950) &#8212; the first being a film about the inception of the “talkie” and a young starlet who makes it big because she has a better voice than the current big name (a less squeaky one, at least), and the latter being about a washed-up silent film star left behind by her former industry to go mad in solitude. Admittedly, <em>The Artist</em> functions much better when it’s closer to the former, but the winks help with the latter.</p>
<p>These “winks” that I keep mentioning mostly come in the form of melodrama, especially towards the end, which gets to be a bit. . . much. But there are also a few clever uses of sound here and there. Hearing Jean Dujardin’s thick, French accent at the film&#8217;s end is especially fun.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dujardin, the casting is phenomenal. None of the actors, even the highly recognizable ones (John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, James Cromwell), feel out of place. But man, does Dujardin look at home in black and white! Roger Ebert described him as a cross between Sean Connery and Gene Kelly, which is pretty apropos. Berenice Bejo as the plucky young Peppy Miller doesn’t do half bad herself, with her winning smile and perfectly placed (by Dujardin, in fact) beauty mark.</p>
<p>So the order for the day here seems to be charm. There isn’t a second of <em>The Artist</em> that isn’t charming in one way or another. But can a film win a Best Picture Oscar on charm alone?</p>
<p><strong>The Artist<em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin), Best Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo), Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Costume Design, Best Directing, Best Editing, Music (original score) &amp; Best original Screenplay</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="The Golden Globes" src="https://i2.wp.com/images.hollywood.com/site/golden-globes2009.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />The first Golden Globes awards ceremony was held in 1944, approximately thirteen years after the first Academy Awards ceremony. The big winner that night was <em>The Song of Bernadette (1943),</em> which took home the Best Actress, Best Director and the coveted Best Picture awards. It was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar as well, but was snubbed in favor of a little indie flick called <em>Casablanca</em><em> (1942)</em>. It’s cool if you’ve never heard of it, what with all the <em>Song of Bernadette</em> talk in film and acting classes these days.</p>
<p>Of all of the awards ceremonies to take place in the early months of the New Year (There are many. Very many), the Golden Globes are by far the most difficult for me to justify. The Critics Choice awards allow broadcast critics to speak their piece, the SAG/DGA/WGA ceremonies are strictly peer recognition and even the MTV Movie awards offer up a light-hearted (albeit sloppy and nearly unwatchable in recent years) alternative to the other (usually) stuffy, self-congratulatory proceedings.</p>
<p>My primary beef with the Globes’ existence stems from the fact that it serves little purpose but to signify the likely winner of another, more relevant award. Aside from that <em>Song of Bernadette</em> incident, Globe winners almost always go on to win the Oscar/Emmy, or at the very least get the same nomination. Couldn’t we just save a lot of time and money and just call these folks? Actually, this is the internet age. Couldn’t they just check out a few movie blogs?</p>
<p>My secondary beef is with the origins of the award show itself and, consequently, its inherent nature. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, who is responsible for the Golden Globes’ creation and voting, was originally conceived as a means by which foreign reporters could gain access to Hollywood’s elite. Instead of saying, “Hi, my name is George and I’d like to interview Steven Spielberg,” you could say, “Hi, I’m George from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and I’d like to interview Steven Spielberg.”</p>
<div style="width: 365px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Ricky Gervais, Golden Globes 2011" src="https://i0.wp.com/turbo.inquisitr.com/wp-content/2010/04/ricky-gervais1.jpg" alt="" width="355" height="310" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh snap! It&#039;s on like Donkey Kong!</p></div>
<p>And so the HFPA panders. They can&#8217;t help it. It&#8217;s kind of their bread and butter. They don’t <em>really</em> want to upset anyone or make an unpopular decision because it would cut off their life’s blood. This year <a title="Ricky Gervais, Golden Globes 2011" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDh0z_ZeZ60">Ricky Gervais hosted the Globes</a> for the second time in a row. It was an interesting choice, although I am not entirely convinced the HFPA was as pleased with it as they&#8217;d like us to believe. There are rumors of grumbling, but nothing substantiated. We&#8217;ll see if he&#8217;s back next year, or, ever gets another silly, superfluous nomination, for that matter.</p>
<p>Me? I&#8217;ll stick with the Oscars. When done right, the Academy Awards are a lovely throw back to Hollywood glitz and glam, but also a nice retrospective on film as a storytelling medium. It acknowledges its <a title="Academy of motion picture arts and sciences" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences">history</a>. It respects the art without spending too much time (Ha! It&#8217;s usually a three hour plus broadcast) patting itself on the back.</p>
<p>Of course, even the Oscars aren&#8217;t always done right. Remeber the year they had all of the previous Best Actor nominees come out, stand in a semi-circle and deliver some saccharine, meoldramatic blather about that year&#8217;s nominees. That kind of silliness is better left to a sillier award show.</p>
