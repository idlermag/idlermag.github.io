										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost seventeen years since I came out, not yet half my life, but edging closer to it year after year. Even way back then, I felt like I was coming into myself late, twenty-one years old and in my last year of college. Today, I read about out LGBT teenagers in high school (heck, even middle school) and I go slack-jawed in awe at the courage that must take. Not that it’s a new phenomenon &#8212; my best friend today was bravely out as a high school student &#8212; but I still think back to who I was at that age and how absolutely impossible that transition would have seemed. The closet is a remarkably cold place for something so insulated from everything around you. It appears to one as a protective armor, a shield from the risk of emotional and physical attack from outside oneself. The reality is that it is more like a straightjacket, a confining garment that constricts the more you struggle against it, until you manage to perform that one magic trick that releases your bonds.</p>
<p>Up until the days, weeks, months that I came out, I could imagine only the worst. As lonely and frighteningly tenuous as that closet feels when within its walls, representing myself with what is essentially a half-lie was the only life I knew until then. No matter what you read or witness or hear about life outside the closet, you can’t truly know it until you’ve made that leap. And that is scary stuff. It’s not as if the understanding of those around you &#8212; friends, family, colleagues &#8212; is completely antithetical to the truth. But sexuality pervades the very essence of each of us. Not our sum total, or even divisible half, but a strong current that flows through every aspect of our most basic selves, making it feel as if everything is tainted when that one part is misrepresented. The build-up of that sort of pressure can be crippling, but so too can its release be equally, if not more, freeing. </p>
<p>I was lucky in many ways in regard to my coming out. I got to choose the moment; it wasn’t chosen for me. I had time to prepare. Laugh if you must, but two of my dear friends &#8212; lesbians long out of the closet themselves &#8212; helped me make note cards with possible arguments to have on hand when I spoke with my parents on the phone. I had parents who loved me, not despite my sexuality, but in concordance with it. My friends were rock solid behind me, even afterwards when I spent the goodly part of a year “catching up” on every gay-themed film, book or discussion I could wrap my arms around. The tedium of that stage in my development for those around me cannot be overstated, I think. I was blessed to be studying (and eventually working) in a field where being gay was prevalent, moving to a major metropolitan city with a large gay population, and met my husband &#8212; now of nearly 15 years &#8212; pretty early on. So, today, it’s easy for me to look back at the process as if it couldn’t have gone any other way. And while I can assuredly echo that it almost always does indeed get better, the honest truth is that every LGBT story is not the same. Some situations, sadly, only get better by degrees.</p>
<p>Renee Montoya is the perfect, albeit fictional, representation of that truth.</p>

<p>One of several lead characters in DC Comics’ 2003 series <em>Gotham Central</em>, and focus of the second story arc entitled <em>Half a Life</em>, Renee Montoya is a detective in the major crimes unit of the Gotham City Police Department. A good cop in possibly the most corrupt city in the world, Montoya stands out among her peers as incorruptible, having even survived the political nightmare of a dirty (although well-meaning) partner, now since retired. She is tough, smart and has earned the trust of both the police commissioner and the Batman himself. And she has a secret.</p>
<p>Greg Rucka, sole writer on issues 6 through 10 of the series he alternately wrote with fellow Gotham scribe Ed Brubaker, presents a tale of the closet unraveling in possibly the worst-case scenario one can imagine. Not only does Montoya get outed publicly at work by the sudden appearance of a surveillance photo pinned to the bulletin board, but a series of orchestrated events lead her to become chief suspect in a murder investigation with protection of her lover Daria as the assumed motive. That plot evolution aside, however, Rucka delivers two key scenes to Montoya’s coming out narrative that boldly reflect his commitment to telling the harsh truth behind the detective’s circumstances: the counsel from Maggie Sawyer, Montoya’s superior officer, and a confrontation with her brother Ben over a similar photo delivered to their parents.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10919" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/01/24/better-by-half/halfalife2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg" data-orig-size="640,502" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HalfaLife2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=502" alt="Maggie Sawyer" width="640" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10919" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=235 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In Sawyer, Rucka presents someone who has come out the other side of Montoya’s travails, an out lesbian holding a significant position of power in what is historically one of the most homophobic and misogynistic professions. She is the golden ideal that Montoya, quite reasonably, cannot project her own future onto. Whether motivated by anger, fear, or most likely both, Montoya divides herself from Sawyer’s experience along lines of race and culture, positing that her boss did not come out as a Latina queer with a family tradition steeped in religious guilt and brimstone. This is a very true distinction and a bitter reality for women and men of color coming out from more traditional backgrounds and families. But there is also a sense that one can’t truly see the possibilities of an out life from inside the closet. The risks still appear to loom too heavily over the rewards, that even were Montoya to see her own future in a magic mirror, it would still remain unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Rucka’s ultimate argument on the closet, verbalized by Sawyer’s final thoughts to Montoya, is particularly astute: “It’s a one-way door, Detective. Once the closet is open, it doesn’t shut again. What you do next, you get to live with it for the rest of your life.” Whether she realizes it or not at the time, Montoya takes this advice into the next encounter with her brother, who shares their parents’ dismay over the shock of her lesbianism.</p>

<p>Ben Montoya isn’t just coming to this news, however. His sister shared her secret with him over ten years before, to poor reception. His role in enabling her closet by covering for Renee’s sexuality with their parents is an insidious, but common aspect of the type of open secret. Those family and friends who cannot immediately accept and embrace their LGBT sister or brother become implicit in the half-lie, reinforce the closet walls as it were, and are posed to suffer from its destruction as well. Ben takes it upon himself to convince his parents the photograph they received in the mail was doctored, that some freak criminal sent it as method of destroying their daughter’s credibility. As it stands, that’s pretty much what happened, but Montoya’s unwillingness to go along with his continued illusion of her heterosexuality is distinctly powerful. As they argue, notably shifting into Spanish to speak in their parents’ language of origin, Montoya expresses clearly her belief that being gay is at the core of her being, not a so-called “lifestyle choice,” and that it is in fact a positive part of herself. No matter what institutions and preconceived notions crumble around her now, she has that admission to depend on. Rucka may throw madmen and dirty cops and frame jobs at his fictional heroine, but this foundation of self-worth and respect means the reader can fight back alongside her, reflecting back her righteous indignation and pride.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10921" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/01/24/better-by-half/halfalife4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg" data-orig-size="640,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HalfaLife4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=490" alt="aftermath" width="640" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10921" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=115 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=230 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><em>Half a Life</em> ultimately owes a great deal to the artistic abilities of illustrator Michael Lark as well. Lark’s rough pencils and deep shadows reinforce not just the grit and grime of Gotham City, but also perfectly reflect the emotional tenuousness behind Montoya’s experience. She is a hard woman at her face, but builds that exterior on a shaky foundation, all the more represented by Lark’s sketched quality of line. Montoya’s range of emotion expressed through Lark’s pencils is nothing short of fantastic, as he takes the reader through every reaction the detective has &#8212; stoic or otherwise. Combined with Rucka’s trademark care for his deeply conflicted heroine, the story of Renee Montoya’s coming out stands as one of the most brutally honest, and deeply realized, reflections of the reality of LGBT life in America, even today. Times may have changed, politics are evolving, but the closet &#8212; that straightjacket of half-lies &#8212; still has a power deeply rooted in a fear and anger that won’t go away in a matter of decades. Thankfully, stories like this one have an inherent power as well, owing to the deep sense of reverence their creators have for their subject matter. As a result, for many readers gay and straight alike, it’s hard to imagine it gets better than this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that scientists recently calculated how much we actually read in our work and personal lives? It seems a typical person today consumes the equivalent of 174 full newspapers a day in information &#8212; nearly <em>five times</em> as much as 25 years ago. Between email, print material, internet browsing, and advertising, we are literally inundated with text from wake to sleep. Frankly, it’s a miracle that anyone can read for pleasure anymore. Who has the time?</p>
<p>Add to this little factoid the reality of being a comic book collector. One of the things I love most about comic books is that, barring some sort of natural disaster, they show up every Wednesday at your local shop. Every week there’s a new crop of books, and I can’t remember the last time I didn’t have at least one waiting for me. Keeping up isn’t always a chore, but it certainly can become one. God forbid you fall a week behind, because that story you haven’t found the time to read yet is about to get spoiled the second you turn on your computer. Twitter becomes a minefield more stressful than jumping around Gotham City wearing a yellow cape, bright red tunic and little green booties.</p>
<p>So with all this energy I’m putting into reading my weekly comic books, email, research for work, internet browsing, and being sold a new cable provider for the 95th time in a day (in order of obvious importance), what about everything else I want to read? Well, it’s quickly become a stack on my dresser, sitting patiently next to my keys and any number of adorable trinkets that don’t have a permanent home. Most of these books are in some state of consumption, half read and then put down &#8212; not because they aren’t amazing, but because life unfortunately gets in the way.</p>
<p>Well, life is just going to have to take a backseat for the next few months, because I now vow publicly to upend this stack by the time the first orange leaf hits the sidewalk this fall. Want a summer full of awesomeness, too? Read along!</p>

Described by the author as “Die Hard in Disneyland,” <em>Alpha</em> is the first book in a new series for Rucka, who not only wrote <em>Gotham Central</em> and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/06/super-heroines-stains-and-all/">Batwoman&#8217;s run in <em>Detective Comics</em></a>, but also my favorite novel series of all-time starring Atticus Kodiak (<em>Keeper</em>, <em>Finder</em>, <em>Smoker</em>, etc.). Undercover Delta Force operator, Master Sergeant Jad Bell has been assigned to the Wilsonville amusement park as an undercover security officer. The action begins with the detection of a hidden dirty bomb and escalates from there. No one writes an action hero’s inner monologue better than Rucka, so this one tops my list.</p>
<p><strong><em>Avengers West Coast</em> and <em>Alpha Flight Classic</em> by John Byrne</strong><br />
Each of these books are over 20 years old at this point, but still have ramifications for Marvel Comics to this day. Both volumes of <em>Avengers West Coast</em> that Byrne wrote and drew (<em>Vision Quest</em> and <em>Darker Than Scarlet</em>) focus heavily on the Scarlet Witch and her synthezoid husband The Vision. In fact, the former’s path to madness begins in these stories and carries through to this summer’s blockbuster comic crossover. Likewise, the first two volumes of <em>Alpha Flight Classic</em> introduce the first and best Canadian super-team in their own series, with the ever-acerbic Northstar front and center. Northstar is currently set to marry his longtime boyfriend in this month’s <em>Astonishing X-Men</em>, so it’s nice to see where it all began for this preeminent gay super-hero.</p>

This one came out of the way-back machine after I listened to an interview with the owners of now-defunct Malibu Comics &#8212; a thriving comic book publisher in the early 1990s who spun off their own super-hero universe, the Ultraverse. The series centers on private investigator Alec Swan, who gets dragged into cases involving the strange and ultra-human, much to his chagrin. Lasting only 18 issues, <em>Firearm</em> was one of James Robinson’s earliest ongoing series and if <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/26/recreating-the-golden-age/"><em>Starman</em></a> and the recently released <em>Earth 2</em> are any indication, I’m going to love this one too.</p>
<p><em><strong>Chicks Dig Comics</strong></em><br />
A collection of essays about comics by and for the women who love them, Chicks Dig Comics features a litany of writers that I have grown fond of year after year &#8212; Gail Simone, Amanda Conner, Jill Pantozzi, Jen Van Meter, Jill Thompson, and many more. Published this spring by Mad Norwegian Press, this is the book to read if you know (or are) someone who thinks comics are just for the boys. The commentaries are simultaneously thought provoking, entertaining, and certainly a source of aspiration for my own writing on comics.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Quality Companion</em></strong><br />
Published by TwoMorrows, one of the comic industry’s most prestigious sources for historical analysis, <em>The Quality Companion</em> is a look at the now largely forgotten comic company that debuted Plastic Man and the Spirit, among other 1940s luminaries. Quality was later purchased by DC Comics and had its characters absorbed &#8212; in one form or another &#8212; into the main DC Universe where I would encounter them years later. Some of these characters are once again being reintroduced in a big way with sexy good girl <em>Phantom Lady</em> striking out in her own mini-series this summer, co-starring the diminutive Doll Man. Everything from bios on the original creators to synopses of the heroes’ books themselves are well documented here both for posterity and your enjoyment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Finn and Charlie are Hitched</em> by Tony Breed</strong><br />
A weekly webcomic by writer/artist Tony Breed, <em>Finn and Charlie</em> is a cute little slice of life for two men who are married and approaching middle age. Although I can read it anytime at <a href="http://hitchedcomic.com" target="_blank">hitchedcomic.com</a>, I do like to double dip and pick up the collections. The first two, <em>Can We Skip to the Part of the Conversation Where I Get My Way?</em> (a phrase I have thought in my head many times while talking to my husband) and <em>I Love You, You Big Weirdo</em> (which I say some form of every night before bed) are now joined by <em>How Would I Know If You’re Dreaming?</em> The new book also features a delightfully naked Finn on its cover with a well-placed penguin to maintain the character’s modesty. Drat!</p>
<p><strong><em>Supergods</em> by Grant Morrison</strong><br />
Last on my list is a book that’s one part history, one part autobiography, and about three parts diary of a big comic book geek (who just happens to be a little off his rocker). Grant Morrison has written some of my favorite titles over the years and the chance to peek into his brain is too good to pass up. Subtitled <em>What Masked Vigilantes, Miraculous Mutants, and a Sun God from Smallville Can Teach Us About Being Human</em>, <em>Supergods</em> is a wild ride through the legacy of super-hero comics that makes it crystal clear these characters are truly our modern myths. Agree or disagree with his observations about Superman, Batman or the like, but you know this is going to be a fascinating read one way or the other.</p>
<p>Now, how much vacation time do I have saved up?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My favorite comic book characters have invariably always been the ladies. Maybe because there were less of them when I was growing up. Maybe because their costumes were more fabulous than those of their male counterparts. Probably because, when written with care, the super-heroines always seemed more intuitive, more vulnerable… just more real than most of the heroes gracing the comic book stands. It was great to see Superman save the world every once in a while, but on a monthly basis, it made him a little smug. I’m still not sure if it was sophisticated writing (or a male-dominated field trying to keep women in their place), but the super-girls of yesteryear never seemed smug. They faced real challenges and had to think creatively to get out of a jam. Their successes were all the more inspiring to me for the difficulty faced in achieving them.</p>
<p>I like to think we’ve come a long way (baby) since I was a kid plopping down 60 cents for the latest <em>Justice League</em>. Unfortunately, something new every day makes it clear that the portrayal of women in comics is still a work in progress. Some writers are consistently getting it right, though. Notable among them is Greg Rucka. You can throw a dart at his bibliography and be certain you’ll find a woman who is more complex, original and compelling than pretty much every other comic book character around. He’s written a string of them, from Carrie Stetko (<em>Whiteout</em>) and Tara Chace (<em>Queen and Country</em>) to Renee Montoya (<em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/16/the-badges-behind-the-bat/">Gotham Central</a></em> and <em>The Question</em>) and Wonder Woman herself. All of them different from each other and, in cases where they are not creator-owned, grown beyond how they were penned before Greg got his mitts on them. And none of them leap into graceful legitimacy either. They’re imperfect people, and gloriously so.</p>
<p>Nothing says flawed like getting literally shot down in the first five pages of your story. This is where we meet Dex, the lead character in Rucka’s limited series <em>Stumptown</em>, published by Oni Press. Dexadrine Callisto Parios is a Portland, Oregon P.I. in the not-so-grand tradition of rough-edged, down-on-their-luck detectives that peppered 1970s television shows. She’s broke from gambling debts, a smoker, a drinker, and has what can gently be referred to as a smart-mouth. But Rucka’s slow, ambling depiction, combined with the rough and moody lines of artist Matthew Southworth, takes Dex immediately from sad case to compelling protagonist. I’m not even sure I’m rooting for her so much as compelled to find out what she’ll turn up next.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9106" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/06/super-heroines-stains-and-all/stumptown/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stumptown.jpg" data-orig-size="429,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="stumptown" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stumptown.jpg?w=268" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stumptown.jpg?w=429" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stumptown.jpg?w=640" alt="Stumptown" title="stumptown"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9106" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stumptown.jpg 429w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stumptown.jpg?w=134 134w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/stumptown.jpg?w=268 268w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></p>
<p>Not that she needs my encouragement. Almost immediately, Dex throws herself into what Rucka endearingly titles, “The Case of the Girl Who Took her Shampoo (But Left her Mini).” Sure, she has a little financial motivation, but it becomes clear early on that the integrity of her work grounds her and pushes her onward without much promise of glory. This Portland is a dark place, rendered beautifully in somber blues and tans, with guys waiting around every corner to threaten, beat or bruise anyone in their way. This is a dirty town, but clearly Dex has learned how to hold her breath and swim in the filth, not to mention take a punch.</p>
<p>Even in what I think is Rucka’s smartest scene, where Dex is finally getting the upper hand on an opponent (albeit over the phone), she still ends up spilling a Styrofoam cup of hot coffee all over her self. And it’s neither humiliating nor heroic &#8212; it’s Portland and it’s Dex’s luck. Even when the story is going her way, she’s not going to come out of it with a metaphoric cape and boots or the adulation of millions. At best, she’ll get by, and that seems enough for her. And me too.</p>
<p>Not that a cape and boots is the key to happiness, mind you. In another stroke of genius, Greg Rucka pens the critically acclaimed (and no less complicated) Kate Kane in DC Comics’ <em>Batwoman: Elegy</em>. Originally published monthly in <em>Detective Comics</em>, pushing aside her long-published namesake from the starring role, Batwoman is the tale of yet another crimefighter stalking the night in Gotham City. What differentiates Kate from the Batman himself is that she never seems to take her fight for granted. Sure, she puts on the same grim façade when taking down thugs in a back alley, but she has doubts and wounds that nag at her when the costume comes off. And not just bruised ribs either. In an early scene in the collection, Kate meets her girlfriend for breakfast after a “night on the town” and no amount of swagger is going to stop the obvious, if incorrect, assumptions from occurring. Bruce Wayne may have girls falling all over him, but Kate’s interests are definitely ready to walk away from socialite shenanigans. And the relationship is no ruse; it obviously still matters to Kate.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9107" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/06/super-heroines-stains-and-all/katekane/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/katekane.jpg" data-orig-size="505,324" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="katekane" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/katekane.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/katekane.jpg?w=505" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/katekane.jpg?w=640" alt="Kate Kane" title="katekane"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9107" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/katekane.jpg 505w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/katekane.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/katekane.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /></p>
<p>As time goes on, the story spirals into something much more damaging than a spurned love affair, and here the chaos of Kate’s past begins to take a physical form. There has been a lot of media talk about Batwoman’s debut as a so-called “lipstick lesbian” and some about her history including a dishonorable discharge from the U.S. Military Academy under “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” Neither of these even begin to compare to what Kate discovers about her past and how it reframes her actions in the heat of battle. These moments wrench the heart out of the character, but the phantom pulse left behind is still enough to keep Kate on mission and me frantically turning pages.</p>
<p>Punctuating these moments with his exquisitely detailed style, J.H. Williams pencils the most complex comic book pages I have ever encountered, and all with considerable grace and easy flow. Every two-page spread is not just a masterpiece in itself, but a visual depiction of Kate’s state of mind. Items break across tightly structured panels and the pages themselves give Kate’s movements a sharpness, dragging the reader into the action. When bombs go off, all the panels shake, and my sense of security in the story goes away. Thoughts bleed from panel to panel and suddenly I’m not so sure Kate is on top of her game, no matter how cool an exterior she projects. I’m feeling a little delirious and I’m only along for the ride.</p>
<p>So why does Batwoman work for me when so much of the story is her getting beaten down? I have the same reaction after Dex gets a black eye or kicked in the ribs. Kate retreats, bandages her wounds (physical and otherwise) and comes back the next night, never knowing when to quit. She’s smart, prepares as much as possible (her accumulated tech rivals any Batcave denizen’s), but when the time comes, she’s out the door no matter what the risk. There is integrity to her mission and drive that supersedes trauma, and she doesn’t need to be the perfect heroine to display it. All her vulnerabilities make her a better character, a better super-heroine, and a better woman for me to come back to read every month. More of this in my pull box, please.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things to come out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;and there were a number of great things that came out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;was the character of Renee Montoya. As a uniformed patrolwoman, Montoya starts off as the smart, straight-laced junior foil to the self-serving, corner-cutting, Batman-hating Detective Harvey Bullock. They&#8217;re both good cops in the end, but while Bullock will lie to cover his own ass and resents Batman for making him look ineffective, Montoya is honest, honorable, and knows that Batman is the same. When the series got a redesign, Montoya got a promotion to detective, and was partnered with Bullock. The comics, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t have much use for Montoya as a uniform, so DC made her a detective and partnered her with Bullock in her very first appearance. She&#8217;s put to great use in the extended &#8220;No Man&#8217;s Land&#8221; storyline, but really comes into her own when the Gotham City Police Department is given its chance to shine in the short-lived but absolutely wonderful <em>Gotham Central</em>.</p>
<p><em>Gotham Central</em> ran from 2003 to 2006, and Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka traded off storylines for the entirety of that run. While <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s fan base was (and is) avid, it was never large, which is something of a crime. The writing and art in <em>Gotham Central</em> are pitch-perfect. The characters are put-upon, overworked, and worst of all in a city like Gotham, honest. Brubaker and Rucka did a difficult thing in an extraordinary way by telling stories that seem exactly the right size in a normally hyper-colored, overexcited universe. (Check out the Teen Titans cameo in the &#8220;Dead Robin&#8221; storyline. It&#8217;s perfectly done.) If you&#8217;re the sort of person who claims to love Batman stories because of the human dimension&mdash;where Batman is just a man pushed to do incredible things at the edge of human (and not superhuman) ability&mdash;then <em>Gotham Central</em> will either give you what you never realized you had always been looking for, or it will call you out as a liar. The Batman is the superhuman presence in these pages, always a force for good, but not always on the cops&#8217; side, as they are well aware.</p>

You almost never see him in action, and even when you do, you don&#8217;t really see him so much as see the effect of what he just did.</p>
<p>On a side note, the series really do a good job of portraying that darkness as something the Batman himself <em>does</em>. There&#8217;s a scene in a later issue where a detective accidentally shoots Batman, and when he&#8217;s laying unconscious on the floor, he&#8217;s just a man in a belt and a cape. As you can see, he gets better.</p>
<p>Death is a troublesome thing in mainstream comic books, and <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s treatment of death is one of the best measures of the title&#8217;s success. As much as comic books would like to tell you that they&#8217;ve grown up, mortality is usually dealt with in a manner that is at best adolescent: Major characters survive against incredible odds while minor characters and extras, in the worst hands, are used as cannon fodder&mdash;a way to titilate the reader and pretend to raise the dramatic stakes by splashing the page with day-glo red. The Batman comics are not immune from this, and a particularly awful recent example can be found in the 3-issue <em>Batman/Darkest Night</em> tie-in miniseries. Darkest Night was a DC-wide crossover event where, um, you know Green Lantern? It turns out there are &#8220;lanterns&#8221; for every color in the spectrum. Just go with it. In Darkest Night you find out there are Black Lanterns, too. Who raise the dead to kill people. And stuff. Anyway, it&#8217;s a very un-Batman, cosmic story, but they did a Batman tie-in anyway. It starts with dead Batman villains raised as Black Lanterns who attack the police department and kill a bunch of cops. Jim and Barbara Gordon get away, because they&#8217;re the only people who really matter, but dozens of nameless uniforms are slaughtered. In all honesty, it&#8217;s offensive. Not because it&#8217;s excessive violence, but because it&#8217;s stupid violence. Every uniformed officer in those pages may as well be wearing a red uniform on an old episode of <em>Star Trek</em>. They exist only to be killed, and in my mind, that&#8217;s lazy, sadistic writing. It makes me feel worse about humanity for reading it, and not in a <a target="new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels#Part_IV:_A_Voyage_to_the_Country_of_the_Houyhnhnms">Gulliver&#8217;s Travels/Houyhnhnm</a> kind of way, but in an I&#8217;m-not-sure-why-I-bother-to-read-comics-anyway kind of way.</p>

That&#039;s right. Page four.</p></div> There are several significant deaths in <em>Gotham Central</em>, and Commisioner Atkins (you read that right) is criticized at one point for having a far higher fatality rate in the Major Crimes Unit than Gordon did. (Gordon, at the time, was retired. He&#8217;s since returned to the job.) Every fatality in <em>Gotham Central</em>, however, matters. They affect the entire unit, and they&#8217;re painful to read because in every case they happen to a character who is made to feel like a person, and not just a plot point. Detective Charlie Fields is murdered by Mr. Freeze on the fourth page of the first issue&mdash;and he&#8217;s killed hard, by the way. Freeze knocks apart Fields&#8217; frozen body in front of his partner&mdash;meaning that Fields isn&#8217;t given much time to become a character on his own, but his death haunts not just the next few issues, but the rest of the series.</p>

By the time <em>Gotham Central</em> takes place, Renee Montoya has survived No Man&#8217;s Land, in which Gotham City was abandoned to anarchy after an earthquake destroyed most of the city, but she&#8217;s a character on the edge, watching good people get hurt and die around her, and ostracized by the department and her family when she&#8217;s outed by a lesbian. (By Two-Face, who still has a thing for her after No Man&#8217;s Land. Just go read it.) Everything comes to a head when Allen is murdered by a corrupt cop, Jim Corrigan, who gets away with it. Montoya, who has been less and less in control of her anger over the course of the series, bursts into Corrigan&#8217;s apartment in a drunken rage, beats his girlfriend (who is also a cop) unconscious, and puts a gun to Corrigan&#8217;s head. In itself, it&#8217;s a rather clichéd officer-on-the-edge revenge scene, but the muted artwork and the relationship between Montoya, Allen, and the reader that Brubaker and Rucka have built over the course of the previous thirty-some issues really raise the scene a level above your average mainstream comic book.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Gotham Central</em> wasn&#8217;t perfect, and wasn&#8217;t a great fit for the DC universe, as a rather awkward Infinite Crisis tie-in issue demonstrates. Overworked detectives make for great noir/procedural stories, but not as much for cosmic/mystical/end-of-the-world stuff. (Interestingly, or painfully, both Montoya and Allen have taken big superhero turns since the end of <em>Gotham Central</em>. Montoya worked on her martial arts and meditation skills to become The Question, and Allen became the new superviolent mystical incarnation of The Spectre. Rucka still writes Montoya admirably as The Question, but Allen was such a great cop character, it&#8217;s a bit sad to see him miscast and largely ignored as The Spectre.) It is however, a great demonstration (along with work like <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/16/watching-the-detectives/">Sam and Twitch</a>), that the police noir-procedural is an amazingly underutilized genre in the comic book world. We need more of it.</p>
