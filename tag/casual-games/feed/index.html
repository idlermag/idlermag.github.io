										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings faithful readers!</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> My gaming time this past week was comparatively light, because I spent the weekend at <a href="http://www.2011.greatlakesthatcamp.org/" target="_blank">The 2011 Great Lakes THAT Camp</a> talking about video games, rather than at home playing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is THAT Camp?&#8221; you say? Excellent question! THAT is short for &#8220;The Humanities and Technology, and THAT Camp bills itself as an academic &#8220;un-conference,&#8221; where archivists, librarians, academics, and tech people (collectively, some of my favorite people in the world) get together to talk and work, rather than to present and listen.</p>
<p>As a pseudo-academic myself, it was wonderful. I was (not surprisingly) most interested in the game-related conversations, which ranged from using games and insights from game design in the classroom, to using games to explore past cultures (and the way that how we&#8217;ve understood past cultures has changed over time), to the nature of interactive narrative itself. Maybe most importantly, while I&#8217;ve always been deeply interested in how games (and literature) require the player (reader) to co-author their own experience, I&#8217;ve always viewed myself as a non-coder. That is, while I have the tools and capability to be a writer, I didn&#8217;t believe that I had the tools or capability to be a game designer. After THAT Camp, I&#8217;ve become aware of some tools and learned some things that might change that. (No, I won&#8217;t be designing <em>Portal 3</em>, but there are ways to create games that are much closer to the demands of indie, digital filmmaking than I ever would have imagined. That is to say, it&#8217;s not <em>easy</em>, but you don&#8217;t necessarily need a team of coders, knowledge of multiple programming languages, and support from Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo to do it.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that ideas from THAT Camp will pop up from time to time in this column over the next several weeks, and I&#8217;ll provide links where I can. You&#8217;ll get a great start by checking out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The THAT Camp web site/blog, which includes notes from many of the sessions&mdash;<a href="http://www.2011.greatlakesthatcamp.org/" target="_blank">http://www.2011.greatlakesthatcamp.org/</a></li>
<li>Play the Past, a site devoted to cultural/historical games&mdash;<a href="http://www.playthepast.org/" target="_blank">http://www.playthepast.org/</a></li>
<li>Inform 7, a tool for creating text-based games&mdash;<a href="http://inform7.com/" target="_blank">http://inform7.com/</a></li>
<li>The Electronic Literature Collection, an archive of digital (usually interactive) fiction and narrative&mdash;<a href="http://www.eliterature.org/" target="_blank">http://www.eliterature.org/</a></li>
<li><em>Alabaster</em>, an interactive retelling of the Snow White story&mdash;<a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/alabaster/" target="_blank">http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/alabaster/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And there&#8217;s more, of course there&#8217;s more, but that will do for now.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> What game time I&#8217;ve had this past week has been largely devoted to <em>LEGO Harry Potter</em>. (Probably, in part, as a break from &#8220;serious&#8221; or narrative games I was spending so much time talking about.) I&#8217;ve made no secret of the fact that on the whole I&#8217;m a fan of the Lego games, mostly because of the combination of humor, inventive visual presentation, and the way that it appeals to my OCD collector impulse. There are a million little things to chase after in each game, many of which require a second or third playthrough of each level to obtain, after you&#8217;ve unlocked a character with a new ability, or explored a little bit more.</p>
<p>Although I do have to admit that part of the appeal for me of the Lego games is the way that collecting items is primarily a function of time invested in the game. The game itself never really gets harder, and if there&#8217;s an item you can&#8217;t reach, it&#8217;s usually because later on you&#8217;ll unlock a character who can jump higher, or climb walls, or make things float, or whatever. The mechanic is one of collection furthering collectability, and <em>not</em> one of increasing difficulty and technical mastery.</p>
<p>That is to say, the core mechanic of the Lego games is a casual gaming mechanic, in which the game provides small, incremental rewards for investing a great deal of time into short, unconnected sessions of gameplay. The contrast to this mechanic would be &#8220;hardcore&#8221; games, which teach the player a specific set of skills and reflexes to allow progression through a series of increasingly difficult gameplay segments. (Think <em>Halo</em>, where you can clearly tell the difference between occasional players and those who spend hours and hours in online multiplayer sessions.) The true distinction between &#8220;casual&#8221; and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; games in this model may not be the total amount of time invested in the game, but the way in which the &#8220;casual&#8221; game allows the player to walk away from the game and return without having to re-learn significant proficiency in a particular skill set. If I&#8217;ve unlocked Jar Jar Binks in <em>LEGO Star Wars</em>, then I always have a character available who can double jump, and reach those out-of-reach items. If I&#8217;ve been away from <em>Halo</em> for a while, then I need to relearn the maps and re-exercise the reflexes and quick in-game judgments that let you pull the trigger before the other guy does.</p>
<p>And I think the fact that &#8220;casual&#8221; games may end up consuming every bit as much time, may reward every bit as much as investment as &#8220;hardcore&#8221; games&mdash;albeit in different ways&mdash;make &#8220;casual&#8221; and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; fairly misleading terms to use to describe the distinction. (After all, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/01/click-click-click-2/">I barely got out of Mafia Wars alive</a>. I still say there was nothing casual about how I played that game.)</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> I just got my hands on <em>Portal</em>. More on that next week!</p>
