										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a person with general anxiety disorder, one of my not-so-favorite pastimes includes imagining the death of my pets.  Don’t worry, it’s not an all-the-time thing, it’s a worrying process smooshed in there with contemplating my failures, considering the nasty thoughts my colleagues and superiors are harboring toward me and imagining my own (surely imminent) death in a fiery car or airplane crash.  But, out of all these anxieties, the pet ones have the most emotional hold on me.  Where the others remain a constant buzzing of the brain, an endlessly critical and overly careful set of voices in my head, the pet worries actually bring tears to my eyes and an ache to my heart.</p>
<p>I love both of my dachshund boys.  Rupert is all stubborn personality and ass (he’s got a big one). To Rupert, everything is about Rupert &#8212; feeding Rupert, letting Rupert sleep and sometimes, when he feels like it, carrying Rupert like a baby.  Add burrowing under blankets and searching for floor foods and you’ve got a good chunk of his autobiography.  My husband and I have had Rup since he was a grumpy puppy who couldn’t believe the kind of miseries we subjected him to.  “Grass?!  You expect me to walk in this stuff?  Ohmygod, is that a BEE?!”</p>
<p>I adopted Enzo after we’d had Rupert for a few years.  I say “I” because my husband, Matt, wasn’t so sure about him.  A half wiener dog with behavioral issues due to previous abuse with a side of deep seated man-fear?  What’s not to love?  His first day with us he clung to me for dear life and we cried &#8212; he for being left in a new place with a jerky big butt dachshund, and me for adopting him a.k.a. tearing him away from his “proper” home and the caretaker he loved.  When Matt first approached him with the leash, Enzo bit him and ran away while pooping himself, but with time and many French fries, they became best buds.  I think Enzo and I have always been joined at the hip (or his nose to my ankle) because Enzo is an anxious and needy person’s dog dream come true.  He always comes when called (heck, he comes when any other dog is called) and he’s always down for a cuddle.  You want to hug Enzo like a teddy bear?  OK, he’ll do that.  You need someone who understands that things like cars and bikes, men and loud little children can be mean and dangerous?  Enzo’s your guy!  We may live in fear, but we do so together.</p>

<p>But what do you do when your fuzzy friend in fear succumbs to your worst fears?  </p>
<p>A few weeks ago Enzo was diagnosed with degenerative disc disorder.  All of those flashes of him on the vet table, Matt and I comforting him, holding him, his little eyes confused then closing as he’s put to sleep in our hands, these flashes became so much realer and too terrifyingly true.  I cry like a fool when this worrying is completely unwarranted &#8212; with a real illness to deal with, you can imagine I was a total mess.  Because a disc had slipped out of his spinal cord, Enzo lost feeling in his rear half.  No tail stub tic-tocking his emotions, no bladder control.  His walking became a pathetic tugging of his splayed hind legs across the carpet.   The Anxiety Girl’s dream dog was fulfilling her worst nightmares.  </p>
<p>We immediately put the dog on crate rest so as not to further disturb his back.  We took him to our vet and got him pain pills, we drove him to Ann Arbor to see a neurologist, but that’s all we could do.  An MRI priced at $2000 could tell us if the exploded disc was disappearing on its own or required surgery.  A $6000 surgery could then either 1.) get the pup on the road to rehab and recovery or 2.) at least insure he wouldn’t be in pain.  With the second possibility Enzo would remain paralyzed but could become a candidate for little doggie back wheels.  </p>
<p>Well, we had already spent $500 on the appointments and meds and we didn’t have any more to give financially.  We had tons more to give in terms of care and love.  Worst feeling ever.  As a family we were pretty much at rock bottom. . . until we got word that Rupert, who was vacationing with Matt’s family, had eaten some rat poison he found in his cabin getaway.  Okay, thanks, Rup *THAT* was rock bottom.   He’s fine.  He apparently has an iron stomach and is some kind of doggie freak show wonder according the vet.  Anyway, this is finally when things started changing.</p>

<p>The Ann Arbor vet, Dr. Issacs, and his team at the Dogwood Veterinary Referral Center (at the pleading of Andrea Conklin, a neuro vet tech and Enzo’s saintly “dog mom” from above) decided that they could give us everything, the MRI and the surgery at cost.  Andrea set up a Chip-In site where people could donate money towards Enzo’s now $2000 care plan and boom, our fate wasn’t quite as sealed as it had seemed.   </p>
<p>Old friends, new friends, Facebook acquaintances, the moms and grandpas of people we’d met 5 years ago, people we’ve never heard of before &#8212; everyone started sending us money.  And Enzo got what he needed.  It happened too fast to understand fully but it’s kind of miraculous.  My dog, my baby boy, our Colonel Peebody, our little buddy is alive and working on getting better.  All my worrying and anxiety came to fruition in Enzo’s broken little body.  We’ve had to carry his limp behind and express his bladder and see pain in his confused stare and send playful dorky Rupert away, but the people around us keep giving and helping. </p>
<p>That’s the part that my sick premonitions forgot to mention.  When the body gives out and the money runs out, your people will be there.  People will care for a creature in need out of sympathy or empathy or because they love his old man eyebrows and bushy mustache, or simply because they love you enough to keep the nightmares at bay for a little while longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you worried you’re karmically fkd? Have you accidentally ruined a deity’s life? The time to repent is nigh. Probably your eternal damnation is not as much of a lock as <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/">this guy</a>.</p>
<p>Darwin Carmichael is <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/128-damned-anonymous-part-ix/">karmically fkd</a>, you guys. This should come as no surprise seeing as how his damnation is broadcast all over the internet. “Every day is a fresh hell, but it’s a chance at redemption.”</p>
<p>The year is sometime around now, though loosely bound to such minor human constraints as time and space. The location: Brooklyn, home of hipsters, stoner angels, minor gods, and only the BEST mythical creatures.</p>

<p>Enter Darwin Carmichael, average guy with a huge karmic deficit. Hip but NOT a hipster. Headed straight to hell in a handbasket. After Darwin accidentally <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/096-melete-and-darwin-part-vii/">ruins the Dali Lama for life</a>, he must begin his never-ending uphill battle to restore his karma. His best friend, Ella Fitzgerald, the karmically blessed, delivers Darwin’s weekly reckoning and serves as his goodness sponsor.</p>
<p>The stand-out star of this comic is Skittles, the old-as-time manticore. His interests include <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/104-skittles-x-mas-letter/">the Jonas Brothers</a>, lava lamps, being a bike pirate, and <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/046-skittles-birthday-party-part-v/">birthday cake</a>. Skittles is Darwin’s pet, the awesome to his chronic, though endearing, lame. His domain is a dinosaur bed sheet tent in the living room. It is the exact fort you dreamed of at age six. His dislikes include <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/008-skittles-is-mad-part-i/">being “accidentally” locked in the closet</a>, <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/068-skittles-owners-presents-jesus/">waiting on Jesus</a>, and <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/067-skittles-owners-presents-oscar-wilde/">the works of Oscar Wilde</a>.<br />

<p>The other all-around winner is Pat, Darwin’s minotaur landlord. I’m not sure why I love Pat, who is dirty, hairy, and sort of a misogynist, but migod is he great. I like that he reminds me of Zach Galifianakis, <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/009-skittles-is-mad-part-ii/">can fix a mean sink</a>, and <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/030-matt-throws-a-party-part-iii/">has a thing for mermaids</a>. I mean we all were a little smitten with Ariel, amirite? </p>
<p>Ella, blessed by divine karmic inheritance, is <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/011-grammar-is-evil/">also fabulous</a>. She&#8217;s <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/106-bike-pirates-part-i/">the original bike pirate</a> and a friend of Ellen. Sometimes, she’s upset with Darwin for no real reason. Always, she’s adorable.</p>
<p>Darwin’s roommate, Matt, is <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/012-art-tickles/">a hipster artist</a>. ENOUGH SAID. His muse, like real-deal muse of yore <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/013-meet-melete/">Melete</a>, has the potential to be one of the most interesting characters in the history of ever. She longs to create something original, though it is her destiny to only inspire others. Girl, I feel your pain.</p>

This coupled with <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/136-damned-anonymous-part-xvii/">the daily awesomeness of Skittles</a> makes for a really enjoyable comic. Like <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/166-a-man-a-mission-part-xix/">candy for the nerdy soul</a>. Different enough from life to steer clear of the mundane, while still being life-like enough to connect to. It’s a deliciously skewed reflection of city living. Minor demons are always holding. Stoned angels desire, nay demand, Reese&#8217;s Pieces, the most heavenly of confections. <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/004-pancake-summit-part-3/">Hipster deities work at cafes</a>. Mythical creatures are the pets we all wish we knew, or in my case actually live with. We all know dudes like Pat, the minotaur. And with my ceiling solidly in its fourth month of leaking steadily, could do worse than have him for a landlord, even if he does drink your beer. </p>
<p><em>DCiGTH</em> is written and drawn by Jenn Jordon (<a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/@manticorelove">@manticorelove</a>) and Sophie Goldstein (<a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/@redinkradio">@redinkradio</a>). Sophie is a freelance artist based in the Bronx. This fall she’ll be venturing to the mean streets of Vermont to attend the Center for Cartoon Studies, not that she needs the practice. Jenn is a doctoral student who lives happily in the magical city of New York with her kittens. Jenn is responsible for the awesome crayon drawings straight from the heart and mind of Skittles, who in his heart of hearts is a thirteen-year-old girl. </p>
<p>Make sure to let your mouse hover over the panels for an extra second or two for more text. The comic updates Tuesdays and Thursdays. Regular visits will totally improve your karma, while also reminding you that you will never lead a full and happy life unless you know Skittles personally. </p>
