					<description><![CDATA[If you can watch <em>Night of The Living Dead</em> on an old, 10" black-and-white television, huddled under a tent made from your own bedding, I'd highly recommend you do so. The more intimate the viewing, the better.  In fact, I believe it to be one of those rare horror films that doesn't necessarily benefit from audience participation.  It wants to scare you on a much deeper, more personal level.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>So it&#8217;s officially October and Fall is upon us.  More importantly, Halloween is just around the corner, which has finally given the </em><em>Cinephiles</em><em> an excuse to focus exclusively on horror for an entire month!  We&#8217;ll kick things off with a childhood favorite of mine, George Romero&#8217;s </em>Night of the Living Dead<em>.</em></p>
<p>If you can watch <em>Night of The Living Dead</em> on an old, 10&#8243; black-and-white television, huddled under a tent made from your own bedding, I&#8217;d highly recommend you do so. The more intimate the viewing, the better.  In fact, I believe it to be one of those rare horror films that doesn&#8217;t necessarily benefit from audience participation.  It wants to scare you on a much deeper, more personal level.</p>
<p>The  story is simple:  A young man and woman, brother and sister, stop by a cemetery  to pay respects.  It is eerily quiet.  There are no other mourners (Sometimes a  small budget can be a blessing in disguise).  As the young man teases his  obviously frightened sister with the immortal line, &#8220;They&#8217;re coming to get you  Barbara,&#8221; a shabbily dressed man approaches and attacks her.  Her brother is  killed in the scuffle, forcing her to retreat to a nearby farmhouse where she encounters a small group of people with similar stories. After  discovering a television, not unlike the ideal one I mentioned earlier, they learn from the local news that the recently deceased are &#8220;returning to life and devouring the flesh of their victims.&#8221;  It&#8217;s pretty grim stuff, and having grown up on the camp of &#8220;Channel 20&#8217;s Thriller Double Feature&#8221; I was ill-prepared for the loss of humanity in <em>Night of The Living Dead</em>.  It shook me.  Normal people reduced to mindless, soulless killing machines.  The monsters here were our own friends and family.</p>

As the flames die down, the ghouls  slowly approach and begin tearing at the charred bodies, devouring them part by part, organ by organ.  It&#8217;s a long sequence and it&#8217;s filmed by an unflinching  camera.  Roger Ebert described this transition in his review, stating that the film had gone from being &#8220;delightfully scary about halfway through, and had  become unexpectedly terrifying.&#8221;  And with that, writer/Director George Romero had reinvented the zombie film (More on that later).</p>
<p>Some argue (justly so) that the film&#8217;s sequel, <em>Dawn of The Dead</em> is the superior film.  And while <em>Dawn</em>&#8216;s story is  larger in scope, its social commentary more deliberate and it&#8217;s SFX vastly improved, it&#8217;s hard for me to agree that <em>Dawn</em> is the <em>scarier</em> film.  There&#8217;s something about its predecessor that just sticks with me.  Perhaps it still makes me feel like a scared little kid hiding under his blanket?  Or perhaps it&#8217;s the scene near the end where a little girl kills her own mother with a trowel?  Yeah, that&#8217;ll do it.</p>
