										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The warm weather’s back, comicomrades! You might remember me telling you once upon a winter that I read exponentially more when I can see my breath outside. That statement was stunningly accurate. Sure, I now have the option of reading a zombie novel under a tree in the commons while I get Hemingway drunk on a balmy afternoon. Don’t think I’m not taking advantage of that. But mostly I find myself gravitating towards the wooden docks next to the Charles where I spend my afternoons napping in direct sunlight like a cat. My mother calls this “a good way to end up dead” but I just call it summer. </p>
<p>There’s something about the skyscraper-reflected sun that makes the city a little more inviting, a little more homey. Squinting into the sun, the city seems like it isn’t all right angles and glass and stone. It’s a little bit softer. It’s trees, and water, and hissing geese too. </p>
<p>Speaking of a softer world, Joey Comeau and Emily Horne began <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=3" target="_blank">their weekly web comic of the same name</a> all the way back in 2003. The thing I love most about this comic is that it breaks a lot of comic rules. Each strip is comprised of three photographs taken by Horne often of friends and local haunts. Each panel is laced with <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=87" target="_blank">typewritten text that’s an equal mix of funny and tragic</a>. This comic is sardonic, and I delight in <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=65" target="_blank">its dark humor</a> more than I laugh at it. </p>
<p>Comeau, who is the author of two novels as well, also has a fun side project called <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/oqindex.php" target="_blank">Overqualified</a>. He writes cover letters for jobs he has no real interest in obtaining. My mancrush, Ryan North describes the letters thusly, &#8220;Overqualified&#8217;s cover letters are like a slap in the face, but the slap is hilarious, and you can&#8217;t stop laughing, and as soon as it&#8217;s over you want to tell all your friends about the slap. You know the kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>He also does a series of interviews called “I Am Other People”. <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/bw-display.php?id=1" target="_blank">This one</a> is my favorite, obv. </p>
<p>Horne’s weekly photo journal <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/iblamethesea/" target="_blank">i blame the sea</a> is also worth a look. Her pictures are frighteningly good at capturing mood. </p>
<p>There’s a lovely little <a href="http://xkcd.com/144/" target="_blank">parody of ASW</a> on XKCD.</p>
<p>Pro tip: don’t forget to hover over the final panel for extra text, often the best bit.</p>
<p>Is this comic for you? Or do you prefer something a little more Sunday paper-ish? Let me know! Have anything mean to say in 140 characters or less? Get at me on twitter @kate_sloan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay kids, this week we&#8217;re back to the round up. I hope you all know how hard it&#8217;s been for me NOT to make a rodeo joke, but I know no one appreciates a clown.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a></em>. I wasn&#8217;t familiar with this comic before my poll, but now that it&#8217;s on my radar I&#8217;m noticing that a lot of people I like really like it. The comic is funny in a nerd-meets-cynic vein, but not in a gimmicky way. It&#8217;s definitely not for everyone, it’s <em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?db=comics&amp;id=2075#comic">a little science heavy</a></em>. But if you&#8217;re sarcastic and tend to distrust the <em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=1863#comic">thinking-power of others</a></em> you&#8217;ll love it. Also, the comic makes <em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?db=comics&amp;id=1937#comic">gay jokes</a></em> that don’t leave me incredibly insulted,  which is always a plus.</p>
<p><em>PhD  (Piled Higher and Deeper) comics</em>. This is another comic for the smarties, mostly commiserating/making fun of the glamorous life in the research trenches experienced by grad students. Hours in the library and lab, instant coffee, fine ramen cuisine  any time your <em><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1367)desires">little black heart desires</a></em>. I like this comic because it makes me really happy that I’m not in a<em><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=125"> dark enough place to go to grad school</a></em>. Also, it uses a lot of words and I get most of the jokes.</p>
<p>The final smart comic of the week is none other than Kate Beaton’s <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em>. I like to think of this as the ultimate smart girl comic. You might recall Rosemary Van Deuren’s excellent piece: <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/20/kate-beaton-is-smarter-than-all-of-us/">Kate Beaton is Smarter than All of Us</a>. It’s still true. This comic is funny in a <em><a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=262">hot-librarian-making-Shakespeare-puns</a></em> kind of way. Luckily, that is one of two languages in which I am fluent. <em><a href="http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=202">Lit jokes aside</a></em>, <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em> is best known for its historical comics. These often focus on a historical figure or event and are effin&#8217; hilarious. Except <em><a href="http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=27">this one</a></em>, this one is grisly as fck.</p>
<p>Any guesses on this week’s winner? Really, not one guess? This week’s nonexistent prize goes to <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em>, for making me feel secure in my <em><a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=213">love of Poe jokes</a></em>.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite in the Round Up so far? Or another comic to recommend? Send me your comments on twitter: @kate_sloan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I asked my friends to suggest web comics the response I received was a little staggering. I had no idea they had been holding out on me like that&mdash;I hadn’t heard of at least half of the comics mentioned. I’m sure you’re all through the last bunch by now. Let’s while away our day together.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/001.html" target="_blank">Mark Doesn’t Understand Animals</a>. I knew about this one already. This comic has one joke and that joke is that Mark doesn’t understand animals. That’s it. Brilliant. This comic does not get old, friends. I read the entire archive every week or so and I laugh every time. This comic is also <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/035.html" target="_blank">really PG</a>. My 12-year-old sister loves it too. This comic has maybe me <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/021.html" target="_blank">want a bunny</a> like I have never wanted anything before. The only drawback is that is doesn’t update often enough for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/" target="_blank">Toothpaste for Dinner</a>. I’ve been reading <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/042211/leaning-back-in-chairs.gif" target="_blank">this comic</a> since college. The best use of your time with this comic is to click random because there are so many to look at. I don’t want you to get overwhelmed. I like this comic because the character is a lovable jerk and that’s how I like to view myself. “Tell us how you really feel” is something I hear at least once a day. <em>Toothpaste for Dinner</em> is written by Drew who also writes another one of my favorite comics, <a href="http://www.marriedtothesea.com/" target="_blank">Married to the Sea</a>. He’s married to <a href="http://nataliedee.com/" target="_blank">Natalie Dee</a> and has a mustache. <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/randomComicViewer.php" target="_blank">This</a> will keep you busy for about a week assuming you don’t sleep or shower (I know, no one sleeps or showers anyways).</p>
<p><em>Exploding Dog</em>. Do you guys remember expoldingdog.com? Really <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/everybreathyoutake.html" target="_blank">emo</a> <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/wishfors.html" target="_blank">pictures</a> you looked at in high school and totally related to? Well, it turns out they’re still awesome. The creator of <em>Exploding Dog</em> draws pictures inspired by the titles readers email him. Let’s all email him something awesome and sad and see who wins: <a href="mailto:sambrown@explodingdog.com">sambrown@explodingdog.com</a>. Going through a few these are mostly about <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/youllloveittrustme2.html" target="_blank">love and miscommunication and miscommunicated love</a>. <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/soonyoullbelikenew.html" target="_blank">Even the happy ones make me feel a little sad</a>, kind of like every song by Johnny Cash.             </p>
<p>Okay friends, these should keep  you from having to answer emails for about a week. You’re welcome.  This week’s winner is <em>Mark Doesn’t Understand Animals</em> because <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/018.html" target="_blank">he. just. doesn’t</a>.                </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you worried you’re karmically fkd? Have you accidentally ruined a deity’s life? The time to repent is nigh. Probably your eternal damnation is not as much of a lock as <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/">this guy</a>.</p>
<p>Darwin Carmichael is <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/128-damned-anonymous-part-ix/">karmically fkd</a>, you guys. This should come as no surprise seeing as how his damnation is broadcast all over the internet. “Every day is a fresh hell, but it’s a chance at redemption.”</p>
<p>The year is sometime around now, though loosely bound to such minor human constraints as time and space. The location: Brooklyn, home of hipsters, stoner angels, minor gods, and only the BEST mythical creatures.</p>

<p>Enter Darwin Carmichael, average guy with a huge karmic deficit. Hip but NOT a hipster. Headed straight to hell in a handbasket. After Darwin accidentally <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/096-melete-and-darwin-part-vii/">ruins the Dali Lama for life</a>, he must begin his never-ending uphill battle to restore his karma. His best friend, Ella Fitzgerald, the karmically blessed, delivers Darwin’s weekly reckoning and serves as his goodness sponsor.</p>
<p>The stand-out star of this comic is Skittles, the old-as-time manticore. His interests include <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/104-skittles-x-mas-letter/">the Jonas Brothers</a>, lava lamps, being a bike pirate, and <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/046-skittles-birthday-party-part-v/">birthday cake</a>. Skittles is Darwin’s pet, the awesome to his chronic, though endearing, lame. His domain is a dinosaur bed sheet tent in the living room. It is the exact fort you dreamed of at age six. His dislikes include <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/008-skittles-is-mad-part-i/">being “accidentally” locked in the closet</a>, <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/068-skittles-owners-presents-jesus/">waiting on Jesus</a>, and <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/067-skittles-owners-presents-oscar-wilde/">the works of Oscar Wilde</a>.<br />

<p>The other all-around winner is Pat, Darwin’s minotaur landlord. I’m not sure why I love Pat, who is dirty, hairy, and sort of a misogynist, but migod is he great. I like that he reminds me of Zach Galifianakis, <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/009-skittles-is-mad-part-ii/">can fix a mean sink</a>, and <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/030-matt-throws-a-party-part-iii/">has a thing for mermaids</a>. I mean we all were a little smitten with Ariel, amirite? </p>
<p>Ella, blessed by divine karmic inheritance, is <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/011-grammar-is-evil/">also fabulous</a>. She&#8217;s <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/106-bike-pirates-part-i/">the original bike pirate</a> and a friend of Ellen. Sometimes, she’s upset with Darwin for no real reason. Always, she’s adorable.</p>
<p>Darwin’s roommate, Matt, is <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/012-art-tickles/">a hipster artist</a>. ENOUGH SAID. His muse, like real-deal muse of yore <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/013-meet-melete/">Melete</a>, has the potential to be one of the most interesting characters in the history of ever. She longs to create something original, though it is her destiny to only inspire others. Girl, I feel your pain.</p>

This coupled with <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/136-damned-anonymous-part-xvii/">the daily awesomeness of Skittles</a> makes for a really enjoyable comic. Like <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/166-a-man-a-mission-part-xix/">candy for the nerdy soul</a>. Different enough from life to steer clear of the mundane, while still being life-like enough to connect to. It’s a deliciously skewed reflection of city living. Minor demons are always holding. Stoned angels desire, nay demand, Reese&#8217;s Pieces, the most heavenly of confections. <a target="new" href="http://dcisgoingtohell.com/004-pancake-summit-part-3/">Hipster deities work at cafes</a>. Mythical creatures are the pets we all wish we knew, or in my case actually live with. We all know dudes like Pat, the minotaur. And with my ceiling solidly in its fourth month of leaking steadily, could do worse than have him for a landlord, even if he does drink your beer. </p>
<p><em>DCiGTH</em> is written and drawn by Jenn Jordon (<a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/@manticorelove">@manticorelove</a>) and Sophie Goldstein (<a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/@redinkradio">@redinkradio</a>). Sophie is a freelance artist based in the Bronx. This fall she’ll be venturing to the mean streets of Vermont to attend the Center for Cartoon Studies, not that she needs the practice. Jenn is a doctoral student who lives happily in the magical city of New York with her kittens. Jenn is responsible for the awesome crayon drawings straight from the heart and mind of Skittles, who in his heart of hearts is a thirteen-year-old girl. </p>
<p>Make sure to let your mouse hover over the panels for an extra second or two for more text. The comic updates Tuesdays and Thursdays. Regular visits will totally improve your karma, while also reminding you that you will never lead a full and happy life unless you know Skittles personally. </p>

I stumbled across the <em>NYT</em> posts of Israeli comic artist and former editor of the Hebrew edition of <em>MAD Magazine</em> Rutu Modan more than a year ago and was completely enamored with her short graphic essays. Then this week I read Modan’s first full-length graphic novel, <em>Exit Wounds</em>. </p>
<p>The story, though interesting and well-crafted, seemed both too long to capture the intensity of the story it needed to tell, and yet too short to reach the conclusion it grasps at. Events in the plot happen too quickly, before the characters are developed enough to warrant investment. The urgency of events dissipates as the scenes are drawn out but not always filled in. The tragedy and excitement are dulled. The moment to draw the reader in suddenly and completely is fleeting, and too often it passes.</p>
<p><em>Exit Wounds</em> is the story of a Israeli man, Koby, and his interactions with his estranged father’s much younger lover, Numi. Numi tracks Koby down when his father Gabriel’s continued disappearance in the wake of several suicide bombings has her fearing the worst. At the time of Gabriel’s disappearance from Numi’s life, Koby hasn’t spoken to or seen his father in several years. </p>
<p>Numi convinces Koby to help her investigate a recent bombing in which the body of one of the victims was burned beyond recognition. Numi, convinced the unidentified victim is Gabriel because she recognized a scarf she knit him among the television footage of the wreckage, doesn’t even consider alternate explanations for his disappearance. Numi has a likable hard-edged innocence. The purity of her devotion to Gabriel is naïve and endearing&mdash;she’s at that precarious moment before love has let her down and believes with complete conviction that the only thing that would keep her lover from calling her is an unforeseen tragedy.</p>
<p>Modan’s tale captures the small traumas of the everyday in the framework of a larger trauma. Modan perfectly illustrates a country in which suicide bombings happen in such quick and frequent succession that a woman must repeatedly clarify which bombing she suspects took her lover.</p>
<p>The title is of course fitting both literally and in reference to the exit wounds we suffer from when people take their leave from our lives. Nothing ever heals completely, least of all the emotional trauma of abandonment. If this sounds depressing, that’s because it really kind of is. </p>
<p>Modan’s characters are equally expressive and imperfect in both <em>Exit Wounds</em> and her visual blog, Mixed Emotions. This series of six brief memoirs showcase Modan and her family, especially her paternal grandmother who fled to Israel from Warsaw during the German occupation. Her characters are slightly lumpy and blemished, the antithesis of the polished diamond-eyed shine of Manga. My favorite post by Modan is <a target="new" href="http://modan.blogs.nytimes.com/page/2/">“Queen of the Scottish Fairies”</a>. The post chronicles Modan and her husband’s amusing struggle amongst themselves over their son’s love of tutus, dolls, and all things pink. </p>

A trip to the hairdresser for Rutu and her grandmother provides the platform for her to examine the basis of their strained relationship.  These graphic essays are short and poignant, just long enough to avoid gimmick and make an impact. The short form suits Modan’s story-telling style in a way that her book-length work didn’t quite accomplish. </p>
<p>In her <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzScsEEbDvk">Pretty Cool People Interview</a>, Modan talks about the funny story about cancer she convinced the NYT Magazine they wanted her to write. The story she mentions is <a target="new" href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/magazine/funnypagesModan.html">&#8220;The Murder of the Terminal Patient,&#8221;</a> a seventeen chapter series that encompasses the death of a singer under mysterious circumstances and the ensuing investigation. But don’t go quoting me on that, friends, my information may or may not be from Wikipedia. I plan on reading &#8220;The Murder of the Terminal Patient&#8221; tonight after I Skype with my family while they eat Chinese food for my mom’s birthday (don’t let anyone tell you we don’t know how to have a good time). </p>
<p>As a bonus, <a target="new" href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artStudio.php?artist=a44be5c884adce">Modan’s website</a> hosted by <em>Drawn and Quarterly</em> looks a lot like something <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/10/on-coming-up-short-in-a-giants-world/">Adrian Tomine</a> might draw!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m lucky enough to live in a city that’s home to an awesome library with a formidable (depending on your level of interest in Charlie Brown’s gang) comic collection. But if I remember correctly from growing up, a lot of libraries are kind of terrible. And because two of my posts so far are really gay, I’ve decided to put off the book I planned to write about this week to write about an indie music web comic instead! That’s right, folks, something for everyone. Three great components, indie music, comics, and the internet, have joined forces to create pure awesomeness and its name is <a target="new" href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/">Questionable Content</a>.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3957" style="width: 219px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3957" data-attachment-id="3957" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/24/a-field-guide-to-questionable-content/questionable-content/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/questionable-content.jpg" data-orig-size="209,285" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="questionable content" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/questionable-content.jpg?w=209" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/questionable-content.jpg?w=209" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/questionable-content.jpg?w=640" alt="Marten" title="questionable content"   class="size-full wp-image-3957" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/questionable-content.jpg 209w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/questionable-content.jpg?w=110 110w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3957" class="wp-caption-text">Marten</p></div> <em>QC</em> is a sit-com(ic) that captures the daily interactions of a group of friends. The comic orbits around Marten, a twenty-something indie music aficionado who works at a library, owns an anthro(pomorphized)-PC, PintSize, and falls in the Scott Pilgrim category of directionless slacker hero. Marten, and for the most part, the entire <em>QC</em> universe, is a loveable mess. The characters work in a wide range of jobs from libraries to coffee shops to. . . offices? Okay, most of the characters work at Coffee of Doom. </p>
<p>Set in a small Massachusetts college town (is there a town in Massachusetts that isn’t a college town?), the cast is a collection of aimless graduates. They bond over music, computer games, coffee, and drinking JUST LIKE REAL PEOPLE. Aside from some futuristic elements and a leisurely time progression, the comic does a great job of mirroring the unguided adventures of most twenty-somethings. </p>
<p>Though most of the characters seem to be on standby life-path-wise, this comic is a nice reminder that we don’t have careers, we have lives. There are much worse things than being young and poor and a barista. </p>
<p>The comic, created by Jeph Jacques, first appeared online in 2003 and is now rounding toward its 2,000th strip. For those of you with awesome libraries/book stores and rocky wireless, this past fall Jacques published <em><a target="new" href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=QC-VOLUMEONE&amp;Category_Code=QC">Questionable Content, Volume One</a></em>, which collects the first 300 strips. </p>
<p>The strip updates five times a week, Monday through Friday. When Jeph’s at a convention there are usually <a target="new" href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1714">pretty excellent guest comic strips</a>. On the rare occasion that Jeph is sidelined due to illness or business, Yelling Bird makes an appearance. Yelling Bird is terrible friend that everyone needs. He’s a total ass, and he will go to great lengths to humiliate you and ruin your life, but damn if he doesn’t <a target="new" href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1729">tell it like it is</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>QC</em> universe has expanded greatly since I first encountered it in college, and though most of the characters are complex and interesting I’m just going to focus on my favorites. I’ll give a rundown of the usual suspects as a sort of field guide for new readers.</p>
<p><strong>Marten:</strong> the warm little center that the life of this world crowds around. In a band. Has cute hair. CoD’s (Coffee of Doom) most loyal, regular, non-paying customer.</p>
<p><strong>Faye:</strong> her sassiness seems bitchy, but mostly it’s just awesome. Barista at CoD. Cute glasses. Average hair.</p>
<p><strong>Dora:</strong> owns Coffee of Doom. Cute in a goth-meets-indie sort of way. Allegedly bi-sexual.</p>
<p><strong>Hannelore:</strong> <a target="new" href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1855">clearly</a> <a target="new" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1674">the</a> <a target="new" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1856">best</a>. Works at CoD. Her intense OCD is somehow endearing. She once learned to play drums in seconds and described her ease by likening playing the drums to <a target="new" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=864">“counting using your whole body.”</a> </p>
<p><strong>Tai:</strong> for lack of a better way to put it, is the lesbian. She works with Marten at the library. Mostly she tries to sleep with straight girls and gets rejected (she’s drawn a little too close to the lesbian-predator stereotype for my comfort). Good hair. Adorable. </p>
<p><strong>Marigold:</strong> WoW enthusiast/guild leader. Painfully shy. Subsists on Pocky alone. Rejects Tai when she tries her luck, but then seems to reconsider via <a target="new" href="http://marigoldfarmer.tumblr.com/post/1531768189/hermione-and-ginny-vs-the-space-wizards">this Harry Potter fanfic</a>. </p>
<p>I’m sure I’m forgetting characters, but these are the ones I like the most in no particular order. The particular order, for those of you curious is 1. Hannelore 2. Tai 3. Marigold 4. Faye 5. Yelling Bird 6. EVERYONE ELSE</p>
<p>The truly great thing about <em>Questionable Content</em> is its evolution. About every month Jacques gets noticeably more skilled at drawing the characters. (See, for example, <a target="new" href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1">http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1</a> and <a target="new" href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1861">http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1861</a>) For someone with a degree in music and no formal art training it’s pretty impressive. If you ever feel thrown off by the change in the characters appearance, Marten is the guy in the black hoodie or the <a target="new" href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=QC-TEH&amp;Category_Code=QC">&#8220;Teh&#8221;</a> shirt (sometimes both), Faye has the nerd glasses and all the sass, and Pintsize is the robot. You’re now ready to join the ranks of loyal <em>QC</em> fans. Feel free to consult this field guide as often as necessary. You’re welcome. </p>
