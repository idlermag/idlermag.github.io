										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes all it takes is a note.</p>
<p>This winter shall be reflected upon as a season of snow days. I am home now, the victim of the latest snow day (actually due to icy conditions in my county of employ). I am sitting at my desk sifting through the mountain of redundant files in my computer. I come across a file labeled Bootleg Babies. I open it up and investigate the contents. The title is a collection of live recordings from the band Underworld. I scan the track lists and one gig lights up my eyes and lights up my ears. Koln, Germany, 1999. Couple of clicks later I am at the trusty, crusty iTunes library. Scroll down and there it is, as it always is, between Udi Nevres Bey and Vampire Weekend: Underworld &#8212; <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Underworld/Live+in+Cologne,+Germany" target="_blank"><em>Live in Cologne, Germany ’99</em></a>. Immediately I start listening. Immediately I am back. Back where?</p>
<p>There are many details about my childhood that I don&#8217;t remember. I can’t tell you much of anything about Elementary school, middle school or high school. I struggle to remember things I&#8217;ve said or commented on in the past. Yet I listen to this live recording and I can pinpoint in exact detail how I ended up with this extraordinary show in my computer.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUhSoF3HF1Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I began downloading this show on May 30th, 2000. How do I know that? In 1999 Underworld released <em>Beaucoup Fish</em>, a tremendous disc full of hands in the hair dance music with hips. In the month of May 2000 I was working at JAM Music on the West Side of Lansing and on May 31st, 2000, I had tickets to see Primal Scream at St. Andrews Hall in Detroit. This show, 11 songs long with a running time of 1 hour and 52 minutes, took several days to obtain via Napster. The songs of the show were all together, laid out in the banks and banks of songs. And over those days I downloaded them all. When I returned from St. Andrews and the epic, white noise, white light Primal Scream show, with my ears still ringing (my ears rang the next four days) the middle four songs of the set had completed. I have been listening to this show, in some form or fashion, ever since.</p>
<p><em>Beaucoup Fish</em> was great, but this was even better. In 1999, the notion of an electronic band as a great live act was no longer just a joke. With Karl Hyde dancing and singing, Rick Smith and the great Darren Emerson manning the controls, Underworld delivered glistening, shimmering, beautifully euphoric music performed in front of a screen filled with art and blotches and blokes dancing. The show was devastating and for a long time it was a litmus test for people I would meet. They liked the show? Good people. Didn’t like it? Not so much.</p>
<p>Even now, my opinion of the show is infused with my own youthful energy and enthusiasm. When I listen to it I feel that sense within, that passion, that glow, that everything everything everything you hear in the band’s lyrics. The energy within those songs, squirrled away within me, is occasionally put to good use. Two songs from this concert are on my running iPod: &#8220;Kittens&#8221; and &#8220;Rez.&#8221; &#8220;Kittens&#8221; starts with a rollicking thump and a pounding rhythm. It pulls you in. At two minutes there is a dark undertone, with voices flitting in the mix. The rhythm breaks into percussion that builds up, a deep tone cries out, the percussion continues and then. . . silence. And then it keeps going relentlessly and (I have goosebumps right now as I type and listen) through the dark some synth pattern begins to play. And then the percussion drops away and it is just synth.</p>
<p>This is the part where I imagine what it would be like to have been there, at age 25. Would these sounds, accompanied by what they were, have brought me almost to tears like they do now? Would they have given me goosebumps? I wonder how I would have reacted to the version of &#8220;Rez&#8221; that closes the show? In &#8220;Kittens,&#8221; the glimmering synths arrive from the dark. In &#8220;Rez&#8221; they start the song on top of a peak and build everything else around those initial high sounds. I could sit here and try to describe the way it sounds, or the way that it makes me feel, but I would not be anywhere close to doing it justice. Just know this: To me, the song feels like a cool breeze on a hot day, and it fills me with the feeling that there is nothing, nothing on this earth, that has the power to transcend time or space or the physical the way music does. Not film, not books, nothing can capture that instant where your body changes from hearing music. Nothing.</p>

&#8212; Me, to my family when I arrived in EL on June 25th.</p>
<p>Thing I most remember was Bono climbing around on the lighting equipment like an Irish monkey.<br />
-– Chris, my longtime record store friend who was in attendance when U2 last played East Lansing on 7 December, 1981.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sunday afternoon: 2:19 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The germ of the idea for my attending the U2 concert at Spartan Stadium happened two weeks prior to the actual concert date. I had pulled together a few friends from my East Lansing record store days for an extended break to start the summer. My manager at the time asked me if I wanted to see U2. She had purchased the tickets when they were initially put on sale. Bono&#8217;s back injury the year before had postponed the original planned date, but the tickets were still good for the rescheduled 2011 performance. The people she bought the tickets before lost interest or too much time had passed and she asked me. I thought about it, checked on my own schedule, and committed. I would have felt odd turning down a <strong>free</strong> U2 ticket. I must remember to get her a lovely Christmas gift this year.</p>
<p>I drove by Spartan Stadium today. Many of the roads were shuttered and closed. You could see the top of the giant stage popping up over the walls of the Stadium. It was impressive. It seemed expensive. It made me think back to the first concert I saw at Spartan Stadium, seventeen years prior. Y’see, when MSU spruced up the Stadium in the early to mid 90s they presented it to the public as if they were going to be gunning for the BIG acts to come and fill the stadium. We’ve got a 76,000 seat stadium, why not try to use it? The first act booked was the Rolling Stones, during 1994’s Voodoo Lounge tour. I remember the show as being a fun time, a nice mix of old and new music. Lenny Kravitz opened and it was the first time I had really heard him and I really dug it. I also remember Mick Jagger talking about East LAHN-sing and how they had never played in East LAHN-sing before. The Rolling Stones may have never played in town before, but U2 have.</p>
<p>The band played three Michigan cities in December, 1981: Detroit at the Royal Oak Music Theater, Grand Rapids at the Fountain Street Church, and East Lansing at Dooley’s. Looking at their tour itinerary on the band’s official website I don’t see a listing for the gig, but it happened. I can only figure that on the way to Cleveland from Chicago the band went through Michigan and took the booking. Touring behind their LP, <em>October</em>, the group crisscrossed the States and Europe on their gradual assault on the world. Two years later the band were back, touring the USA. U2 played the Grand Circus Theater in Detroit. One year later they played the Fox Theater and the next year on the same tour played the Joe Louis Arena. In 1987 the band filled the Pontiac Silverdome.   U2 played 18 songs at Dooley’s. I wonder how many they will play tonight.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking around U2’s website and digging through their merch store (I’m a sucker for band t-shirts) and for some reason, for as much as I like and respect the band for the music they make and just what they are, I can’t get over the fact that more than anything the band is a corporation. A business entity. An entertainment entity, sure, but a business at the core. I read in <em>The Detroit Free Press</em> how the band is footing a $253,000 bill to replace the grass at Spartan Stadium due to the extreme weight of the stage. What does this have to do with business? I’m not sure but there is something bigger when it comes to thinking about this band. At the end of this tour they will have grossed $700 million. Seven hundred million dollars. Mind-boggling.</p>

<p><strong>Sunday evening: 12:04 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>Amazing. Simply amazing.</p>
<p>I won’t bore with the usual recaps, I’m sure that every gig U2 does could contain the same points and observations. What I will bore with is the fact that this may be the greatest show I have ever been to. It felt non-stop and action packed and full of sound and energy. It was almost too much.</p>
<p>Florence and the Machine opened for the U2 and I enjoyed their set. What I did enjoy was watching the lead singer come onto the stage. Where the rest of the band dressed in black, she (Florence) wore a red, drapey billowy dress that would catch on the wind. It made for a striking visual. The break between the opening set and the main show was brief, which was a plus.</p>
<p>Bowie’s &#8220;Space Oddity&#8221; was the opening music, the refrain into the countdown. And then U2 were on the video screen descending into the open. They came on stage, one by one: Larry Mullen Jr, then Edge, Adam Clayton and finally Bono. They opened with &#8220;Even Better Than The Real Thing.&#8221; Cameras filmed the band and the shots of the Edge or Bono with the blue sky and backdrop of the fans in the stadium was terrific. In fact that video screen was amazing all night, from the shots of the band to the differing visuals throughout the songs. It added more than it subtracted and it was nice to be able to see the band <em>and</em> see them on screen.</p>
<p>While I was enjoying the show there was a moment, crystal clear, that took the evening to the next level. The band began playing &#8220;Beautiful Day&#8221; and something in me lifted. The song lifted me up. I looked around the bowl, I looked at the lights, I heard the music, I felt alive, and I started to cry. Not all the way, but enough to wipe at least once. The music moved me, the whole swirl of the event moved me, I was almost deliriously happy. I just felt so lucky, to be alive, to have the life I have, to be sitting there watching the show, so many things in place for me. The song just made me feel amazing. Three songs later the band played &#8220;Zooropa,&#8221; a song I absolutely adore. I never knew they even played the song live.  My own personal favorite period of the band is <em>Achtung Baby</em>/<em>Zooropa</em> and the show featured a heavy sample of those songs. As the video screen dropped and expanded like a giant butterfly net words were displayed on the screen and voices spoke various lines of questions. The one that stuck with me was, “Am I a good father?” Then the opening riff came in, I was completely blindsided and once again moved to tears.</p>
<p>Music is so personal yet so transcendent. Music gets within you, changes you so that when you re-encounter certain musics you go right back to when you first heard them. The middle period of the show made me love my life and miss my family. I could see my children’s faces in my head, smiling and happy in the sun. I could see myself at 13 watching the video for &#8220;With Or Without You&#8221; on MTV in the middle of the night. I could see myself listening to <em>Achtung Baby</em> on a bus ride back home after a High School football game at 17. I could see myself driving around town listening to Zooropa when I was 19. I could see myself walking to class in the MSU Auditorium or listening to <em>Po</em>p when I was 23. I could see myself downloading <em>All That You Can’t Leave Behind</em> off of Napster when I was 26. I could also see myself driving across town at the same age listening to the same music.  I could see myself getting a U2 iPod for Christmas and listening to <em>How To Dismantle An Atom Bomb</em> while driving to Traverse City to see my girlfriend at 30. I could feel and sense and remember my life, all within a few songs. I am sure that many other people had that connection during the show, remembering the first time they saw the band or heard the songs.</p>
<p>Earlier today, before leaving for the show, I wrote about the band as a business. I still think that is true but having been at the show and taken it in U2 really are so much more. I felt as if every worry, every concern or stress I had been carrying with me throughout the day, week, and month disappeared at the show. I was swept up in the sound, the visuals and the moment. It was an escape, an incredibly personal escape shared in the company of 67,000 other people. It reminded me why I love music and what is so great about music, that connection. The four men in U2 are millionaires who own so much land in Dublin that it is said you could walk entirely on ground they own while visiting the beautiful city. Yet they are also gifted musicians that have been producing epic, personal and transcendent music for over thirty years. I felt lucky to be at the concert, and I felt grateful (if you could call it that) that I have had the music of U2 in my life for so long. Without my connections to the music tonight’s show would have been great but I doubt I would have been moved to tears on different occasions.</p>
<p>I did go into the show wondering if something would be addressed, something I wrote about in the top part of this column: the show in town thirty years ago. Bono cheering &#8220;Go Green&#8221; was nice, but easy. I wondered if he would reflect or mention the time they last were in town. As he spoke of the making of <em>Achtung Baby</em> twenty years ago, mentioned the fall of the Berlin Wall while mentioning a wall being constructed in the studio, Bono stood at the lip of the stage next to the Edge. While playing an acoustic Bono said he wanted to change the atmosphere in the stadium, he didn’t want us to think of the song as if they were playing it in a stadium. He said let’s bring it down to a pub, “a pub like Dooley’s. Anyone remember that?” he said with a smirk. “Some of you may.” </p>
