										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 30th marked my last day working at the bookstore. Now I’m just preparing for baby and trying to work on editing my novel between naps. There are a lot of naps.</p>
<p>My first visit to the bookstore was the day after my last day. I had a huge stack of books to buy and had saved my pennies and sold some books I no longer wanted. Plus I missed everyone already and needed to see their faces. I also missed the stacks of books and all the shelves lined with stories I hadn’t read yet. Bookstores have always been a magical place where I could lose myself for hours just thinking of all the books I wanted to take home. Bookstores smell nice and the staff is smart. I was truly proud to be a part of my store’s 30 year anniversary party this fall. It’s become an impressive thing to have an independent store last that long in the book business.</p>
<p>Now it’s been nine days since my last day, 23 by the time this gets posted, and I feel like I’m floundering a little. I don’t know what the new releases are. I don’t know what new author Amanda is in love with or how far Dylan is in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (<em>Game of Thrones</em>) series. I don’t know the latest crazy customer story from Sue or how many times Allison has been hit on while shelving science fiction. Maybe she doesn’t even shelve that section anymore. I can’t confidently point out the location of the large-print section, it moves about five times a year, never settling into a true home. I haven’t seen Donna’s beautiful fall books display and I have no idea what new humor or fiction books are showcased at the register. I know I could drive there and find out, but I used to just know. I spent hours absorbing books and now that’s over.</p>
<p>A quick look at most of my bookshelves at home can remind me that I have plenty of books here that I haven’t read yet. Much to the chagrin of my ex-coworkers I do not shelve my personal collection in alphabetical order. Some shelves contain only my favorites. One shelf was all science fiction but now it has plays and a couple classics thrown in. Mostly I want the books to look pretty. Yes, they are for reading, but one of the reasons I don’t simply download books onto my iPad is because I like the way they look on a shelf. And stacked on tables. And lined across the mantle. And sometimes left to sit in bags for a week because I don’t have room for the new batch. </p>
<p>It’s still difficult not to buy new ones. I won’t have the daily temptation of beautiful covers or intriguing titles but I’ll also have less money to spend on books. I know I’ll still look through the used books and the sale books every time I visit the bookstore. I need to keep up-to-date on new books coming out. I had to find out that Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biography came out through <em>The Daily Show</em> like a commoner instead of seeing it on a cart in the back room a week ahead of time. I’ll have to follow through on my cousin Elizabeth’s suggestion and start visiting my library too. Although there can be a wait to borrow the most popular titles it is cheaper, so long as I can remember to return the books on time, not something I’m great at.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in which I’m huge and don’t really want to leave the house, I need to remember that I haven’t read at least half of the books in my own home. Maybe that sounds odd to you, but working in a bookstore for three years gives you a lot of opportunities to buy books. All of my personal spending money went to books and coffee for those three years. I have at least a hundred receipts for books filed away. I have galley copies from authors I had never heard of before taking the book home because maybe someday I might want to read it. Free books are hard to pass up. I have my husband’s science books that I made him buy with his own money but that I plan on reading too. And now we have kids books added to the mix. The baby needs his own bookcase and he isn’t even born yet. </p>
<p>Maybe this winter while it’s bitterly cold and I don’t want to leave the house, I’ll start at the top of one bookcase and read every book on that shelf, working my way through the entire collection. Then I’ll know what I want to keep and what I want to sell come spring. When warmer weather arrives I can unload the old at our used book counter, pick out a whole new stack to take home and line up prettily until I have time to read again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I forget that I’m a grownup. I still feel like I’m only 21. Every now and then, something will remind me that I’m no longer the target audience for Ke$ha’s music. This week I had drinks with someone born in 1990. I get cranky about the music that’s popular—why is it all club music? KIDS THESE DAYS. Most of the time, I’d rather just stay home and read a book with a cold beer, instead of taking all that time to make myself look good enough to compete with the young whippersnappers when I go out.</p>
<p>But it’s not all dentures and rocking chairs. On Saturday night, I went with Charlie to his work holiday party. As an undergraduate, work parties were awkward affairs in the break room, with the background music of a jamming printer and someone mowing the lawn outside of the basement-level windows. We sat as far away from each other as possible to avoid accidentally bumping elbows or knees with someone, staying only long enough to be polite, eat a piece of cake, and get the hell out of there.</p>
<p>Even after I went off to the corporate world, our work Christmas party was held in the back room of a bowling alley. When we came in, we were ushered past the bar, the pool tables, and the bowling lanes, into a tiny, dark room with an apathetic woman tending bar in a stained white shirt. The party budget covered an open bar, some standard fried food, and unlimited cold pizza, but did not cover bowling or pool. Apparently the bowling lanes were just for show. As a fun alternative, we were all forced to sit on Santa’s lap and take photographs. My friends and I went to the bar afterward to forget what had just happened. It was a slight improvement over my previous work parties, but only in the way that a filling is an improvement over a root canal.</p>
<p>But, dear readers, getting older just means learning how to party more effectively. Charlie’s work party was no joke. It was disco themed, but I’m as bad at themes as I am at costumes, so I chose to ignore that and wore an open-backed top with enough cleavage to say that I’m fun but not so much that Charlie’s friends would think I was a hussy.</p>
<p>When we got to the party, we had to wait in line for a bouncer to let us in. A bouncer. That was my first clue that, even though this was held in their office building, this would not be a party in the fluorescent-lit break room with mediocre cake. No it would not. After we checked in and checked our coats, we went straight for the bar, which was already overflowing with pre-mixed drinks, beer, and wine. The building was full of women in short, sequined dresses and men in platform shoes. Tents were set up outside with strings of lights, couches with neon pillows around fire pits, and women in pink costumes handing out rave jewelry and candy. Charlie’s company clearly values their employees more than mine did.</p>
<p>And the food. Let me tell you about the food. In one room was Japanese, in another was fancy vegetable dishes, some sort of strange fish paste that looked like mashed potatoes, gourmet mac and cheese, meatballs, and many other fresh-made things that I was too wide-eyed to really notice. Some party regulars thought it was nothing special, but I was like a fucking country bumpkin at a five-star restaurant. I was mostly too anxious to eat. Food at social events like this always gives me so much anxiety. Why serve gigantic slabs of chicken without knives? Am I supposed to eat it with my fingers? How can I eat this macaroni and cheese with a fork while I’m also trying to carry my drink? Do I have anything in my teeth? Why is everyone else so much more graceful at this sort of thing than I am? In the end, I decided to avoid the potential for screwups entirely and save my appetite for the dessert tent.</p>
<p>Guys, you have never seen a dessert tent like this. It was set up like a set from Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Everything was edible. There was another bar serving champagne floats with lemon sorbet. Big pink lollipops hung from the ceiling. Charlie and I drunkenly cut the line for the chocolate fountain. I chose a cheesecake lollipop (a tiny piece of chocolate-covered cheesecake on a stick) for the fountain, and was too impatient to let the chocolate harden, so I promptly dripped it all over my cleavage, arms, and feet. I found bits of chocolate on me all night long.</p>
<p>Each room had its own bar. Our work parties were all grown up. We closed out the night dancing to a band recreating all the bad pop songs in a room hung with disco balls where hired girls in afro wigs danced on tables. We’re not quite grown up yet.</p>
