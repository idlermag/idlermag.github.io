										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of October I gave birth to a handsome baby boy named Joe, which means I am typing this one-handed while the little guy sleeps against my chest. When we were leaving the hospital one of the techs came in and gave me two books, a paperback picture book and a board book. I think I was more excited to see these books being given away than most moms because I used to volunteer at my local library for that same book program.</p>
<p>The program, B.A.B.E.S. (Babies And Books Equal Success), gives away two books to new moms when they leave the hospital and a third book when they visit the hospital again for their baby’s one month check up. The books used to come with a pamphlet about the benefits of reading to babies right from the start. It encouraged moms to read and visit the library, telling them how far away their baby can see and how black and white images are easiest for newborns to make out. Last February the funding for RIF and the books for babies program through my library was cancelled. First we dropped the third book given but eventually we had to shut down entirely. We packaged as many books as we had remaining on the shelves and then my weekly trips to the library were over. When a friend of mine had her baby girl in April she didn’t get any books. We both worked at the same bookstore and had plenty of books from friends and family, but I was sad to know that the program I had spent so much time working with didn’t benefit her. It was also frustrating to know how many newborns didn’t have the same libraries at home that our babies had, sometimes the books from the hospital were the first books babies received. I&#8217;m thrilled to see the program up and running again.</p>
<p>Joe has dozens of books. I’ve been stockpiling since I first became pregnant and friends and family have given us their own childhood favorites. We have classics like <em>Goodnight Moon</em> and <em>The Giving Tree</em>, newer titles like <em>Bear Snores On</em>, and my personal favorite, <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em>. I teared up reading it to myself when I was still pregnant, silly hormones. I look forward to reading him bedtime stories every night. I hope he shares my love of stories and books in the future.</p>
<p>I emailed my old volunteer supervisor after I got home from the hospital, excited that the program had regained its funding. She emailed back saying that these were still just leftover books. New grant opportunities were not given to our library by RIF (Reading is Fundamental) so we didn’t have the funds to continue the project. The library has so little money right now that even if RIF funding did come through, it would likely go to other programs that people understand better. Babies getting books was always something that people in the funding department had difficulty understanding. Maybe they preferred to give books to the bookmobile, something I always loved as a kid, and other programs for kids who were more established readers. But the way you get an established reader is to read to the kid from the start. BABES encouraged parents to start reading to their baby before the child really knew what was going on. It was important bonding time and leads to a pattern of reading in the household. I think the program is invaluable to parents who might not have the access to books that I do.</p>
<p>Right now, at 13 days old, he’s just not interested. I tried a board book with different textures but he’s too young to be reaching out and touching things. The cloth book my friend made for him held a little more interest, probably because when he mashed his face against it the book was soft and he could rub his cheeks on it hoping for food. Cloth books are great for starting out reading to little ones, I could hold the book on one hand and didn’t have to worry about jabbing the new baby with pointy corners. My friend bought the pattern with the pictures on it and simply cut along the dotted lines then sewed it back together. That’s a craft project even I can do.</p>
<p>As much as I would like to establish nightly reading with the kid now, I think a better understanding of what night is will have to come first. My boy is an excellent daytime sleeper but is a night owl. I want to do everything perfectly which is a tall order for a first time parent. Right now maybe I’ll focus on keeping him fed and clothed with a clean diaper. I’ll focus on reading my own books in the 15 minutes I can sneak here and there. If I want I can read to him from <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, the fifth book in George R. R. Martin’s series, which is the only book I want to read right now. Too bad I have it in hardcover; it might be bigger than the baby.</p>
<p>When Joe can reach for things and I have a little more sleep in my nights we can try taking another crack at his library. My husband’s work recently sent us a baby gift basket that included a new book among the toys and clothes. The universe seems pretty determined to have me raise a voracious reader, I’m happy to have so much help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons <em>Ender’s Game</em> is my favorite book is because you see how the adults are manipulating Ender, the main character who is six when the novel begins, and how he reacts to the new world they force upon him. Ender is smart. He adapts quickly and understands most of the manipulation going on around him. But he’s a child and most of all he wants friends and a happy family. His trust in the adults around him is sweet and humanizing. I love seeing the world from the point of view of a child in books for that reason. Their naiveté shows me how the world could look, how the world probably used to look to me, and it’s a good way to introduce new settings and characters.</p>
<p>I’m currently reading <em>The Good Thief</em> by Hannah Tinti. The main character, Ren, is about 12 years old. He has lived his entire life in an orphanage run by monks, so those 12 years haven’t given him a lot of worldly knowledge. When he is adopted by a man, Benjamin Nab, claiming to be his long lost older brother, Ren is ecstatic. He has been passed over by numerous other potential families because he is missing his left hand. Ren soon discovers that Benjamin is not his brother, in fact the man takes on a lot of roles. Whatever is necessary at the moment to get a room for the night or some food in their bellies, Benjamin will do. And Ren’s missing hand is a great selling point for all of the scams he plans to run.</p>
<p>I’m only about a third of the way into the book and already I want to reread it. The scene where Ren first comes to a large city is well written. He is seeing so many things for the first time that he has no idea how to put into context. The man with two women in the alley who are showing off their legs winks at Ren as he hands the women some money. The little knowledge he has of the world allows the author to make the mundane interesting again. I like when a child is the narrator or main character over a naïve adult. Adults should know better and when they don’t they are usually more aware of the feeling of embarrassment or shame at being unfamiliar with the world around them. Children can be embarrassed, but seem to enjoy the new world around them more.</p>
<p>Ren is taken in by two con men &#8212; Benjamin has a partner, Tom, who teaches Ren how to get money and lie. Ren was already a good thief &#8212; it was the only way to have something that was truly his at the orphanage &#8212; and he impresses the men with his sleight of hand. I treasure the moments when the young boy takes the men by surprise. After seeing him struggle and adapt, it’s nice to know Ren still excels in certain ways.</p>
<p>Young adult books appeal to me for the same reason. The main characters are seeing things for the first time and can often only put what they see into the context of the few things they already know. It gives authors a chance to show off narrative skills and make everything shiny and new. I prefer the sci fi young adult books to the coming of age/high school dramas because they give me a chance to encounter something new as well. It doesn’t really matter how well written meeting a cute boy or getting a first kiss is, I’ve done it and it’s going to take a lot to make me care. Since these books are meant for people who haven’t seen a lot of the world either they don’t always hit the same tone as books for adults with children as main characters.</p>
<p>I’m excited to see how much Ren grows and learns by the end of the book. Children lack the cynical attitude that can pull me out of a story. When they are excited and interested in their surroundings I find it easier to keep reading through a slow section. I need to find more well-written books with children leading the way. Any suggestions?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never read <em>Harry Potter</em>. Working in a bookstore with loads of diehard Potter fans, my usual excuse often fell short. I tried telling people that I was simply too old when the books came out. The first book was published in the fall of 1998 in the U.S. and I was in eighth grade. My favorite author at the time was Stephen King. Why would I drop down a few reading levels when I didn’t even like wizards?</p>
<p>Not to mention, when I was growing up no one I knew was reading them. I don’t think I heard much about <em>Harry Potter</em> until the first movie came out in 2001, I was a junior in high school and reading Toni Morrison &#8212; for school &#8212; and Tom Clancy &#8212; for fun. But these reasons didn’t work on my coworkers. While most are my age or a few years younger, quite a few of them didn’t read the Harry Potter books until high school or college, so my age was no longer a factor. I had seen a few movies and I knew most of the spoilers &#8212; who dies, who marries who at the end, who isn’t as bad as you thought they were at the beginning &#8212; and I just wasn’t interested in reading these books since I knew the ending. This did not go over well.</p>
<p>So I made a compromise. I told my Potter-obsessed coworkers that if I ever had kids, which I didn’t plan on having, and if those kids wanted to read <em>Harry Potter</em>, I would read the books too. I still got a few, “Isn’t this new <em>HP</em> Lego set cool, oh wait you never read the books” comments, but for the most part the subject was laid to rest.</p>
<p>Well, here we are over a year later and I am indeed pregnant. I’m probably the only person who remembers this <em>Harry Potter</em> reading deal I made, but I’ve been thinking on it a lot. Mostly because I am a reader and I want my little boy to be a reader too. I already have a little library started, thanks to my mother and the children’s book manager at my store. I’ve tried reading aloud to my belly, but it feels really weird. Despite the fact that I regularly talk to myself aloud, reading a picture book to something that can’t see or really understand what I’m saying feels like something a crazy person would do.</p>
<p>I’m excited to read to my baby once he’s in the world and see him grow and learn to read for himself. I know <em>Harry Potter</em> is a good series, so I will be happy to have him read those books. The main reason I agreed to read them if I had a child was because if my kid is like most people he’ll love the books and want to talk about them. I would love to be a part of that conversation.</p>
<p>I also think it’s important to know what your kid is reading. Depending on how young he is when he starts I want to know what the series have in store as the books get longer and a little scarier. Since he won’t have to wait a year for the new book to come out, he won’t be growing up with Harry, my son could read them all in a row and I want to make sure the content is appropriate. I’ve had enough parents of 8 year-olds come in to buy <em>The Hunger Games</em> to understand that knowing the content of the books your child is reading is important.</p>
<p>“There’s not any sex in this book is there?”<br />
“Uh, no ma’am, just a lot of killing and some torture.”<br />
“Oh ok, we’ll take it.”</p>
<p>I know some people don’t want to read every book their teen or preteen is reading, but there are resources and book sellers who can tell you that <em>The Hunger Games</em> is coded for ages 13 and older for a reason. The world in that trilogy is scary and people die left and right. When your main character is told to kill or be killed you need more than 8 years of life under your belt to deal with it.</p>
<p>Right now though I just have to deal with Dr. Seuss and board books. The baby isn’t due until October and I can worry about whether he wants to read <em>Harry Potter</em> in a decade. I’m building my stack of kids books and learning to talk to the little guy who’s growing inside me, not just myself. Maybe I’ll even read to him soon. Though, to be honest, I would rather read the second Sandman Slim book, <em>Kill the Dead</em>, aloud to my belly than <em>The Lorax</em>. I’ll even skip the swear words.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When you think “Mad Men,” you most likely think of Don Draper all pressed and neat, dark secrets lining his smartly tailored jackets, beautiful lies lingering on his lips.  You might think of Betty, the picture of grace (or Grace Kelly) quietly suffering her domestic incarceration behind the mask of perfect pink lips and expertly lined eyes.  Or maybe you can’t get Joan out of your head.  The way she walks down the hallway of the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce offices you can’t help but imagine the symphony that accompanies her cool sashay and impossibly girdled buoyancy.  But what about the little guys?  Those little guys with reason to be mad who are hardly men or women?  What do we make of the kids on the show? They certainly don’t seem “alright.”

You might think of Betty, the picture of grace (or Grace Kelly) quietly suffering her domestic incarceration behind the mask of perfect pink lips and expertly lined eyes.  Or maybe you can’t get Joan out of your head.  The way she walks down the hallway of the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce offices you can’t help but imagine the symphony that accompanies her cool sashay and impossibly girdled buoyancy.  But what about the little guys?  Those little guys with reason to be mad who are hardly men or women?  What do we make of the kids on the show? They certainly don’t seem “alright.”</p>
<p>The children featured on <em>Mad Men</em> have often caught my attention and from what I can gather from the first few episodes of the fourth season, it seems like the Draper kids will be examined more closely and in greater depth.  On the most superficial level, Sally, Bobby and baby Eugene, serve as fictionalized representatives of childhood in a particular era in U.S. history.  The show very clearly complicates the Beaver Cleaver mythos of the 60’s by showing us a perfect-looking yet dysfunctional family—one more akin to our favorite baby boomers’ stories of the past than a Nick-at-Night portrayal of yore.  On <em>Mad Men</em>, childhood is a time when knuckles were rapped, arms pinched and bottoms beaten.  We see the little Drapers struggle with parental love that is tough, lacking and/or ill-communicated.  There is an almost funny bluntness to the missing care for these children especially as the show’s familial scenes provide a stark contrast today’s very child-centric views.</p>
<p>For example, Betty isn’t thinking at all of her daughter’s “self-esteem” when she calls Sally fat and says she has the makings of a good “little lesbian.”  Don, in turn, plays the archetypal absent father.  Never there, he becomes the perfect object of his children’s affections.  His returns at the doorstep are met with squeals of joy as he comes bearing gifts from far away. Don&#8217;s persona as father (similar to many other facets of his identity) is a blank screen on which his children project their desires.  Every now and again he’ll furrow his brow over his part in his children’s futures, but he rarely does anything to change their situation for the better.</p>

This is a show about advertising, after all, and <em>Mad Men</em> smartly delivers the darling Drapers as more than just a throwback to bygone times.  When they are left on their own, ignored, or neglected, they do what comes so naturally even today and bask in the warming glow of the television.  Little demographics incarnate under <em>the</em> Don Draper’s own roof, the kids become the open vessels into which Don’s advertising pours.  The absent father reaches them through the mysterious amalgam of the media.  Kind of an interesting linkage to think about in a present where a family might text each other while watching <em>Mad Men</em> in the same house, no?  Take the leisure time of the middle class lifestyle, a lack of parental care and add in the modern achievements of technological distraction and you get a cohort of children who desire things, kids with psychic and emotional voids that need to be filled—the life’s blood of the ad game. </p>
<p>So, lucky for Don, the kids aren’t alright? Sad, but weirdly true.</p>
<p>Most recently we’ve seen Don win a Clio for a commercial featuring a young version of himself imprisoned behind the bars of a regular kitchen chair. His mother mops the floor into a bright glow, but our lonely cowpoke’s sadness radiates and resonates far more than the product. And of course we’ve just witnessed the infamous masturbation episode in which poor Sally is slapped and admonished for touching herself. While Don gains recognition for his disturbed childhood but also begins to circle the drain of a violent alcohol addiction, I’m left wondering how Sally’s future will unfold. It’s easy to imagine her drugged out and oversexed in a dingy seventies nightmare, but I’d prefer to see her grow angry and strong, the kind of “lesbian” her mother would hate…and envy.</p>
<p>But, AMC might not let us see that far into the future. So, for now, do me a favor and the next time you’re watching <em>Mad Men</em>, take a closer look at Sally and young what’s-his-name and the other one.</p>
<p>They could use the attention.</p>
