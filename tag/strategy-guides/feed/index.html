										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I decided to try another play-through blog series, and this time it is <em>EarthBound</em> for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (both of my readers will remember my previous adventure, <a title="Geek Speak – Final Fantasy VII Revisited part 1" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2010/12/23/geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-1/"><em>Final Fantasy VII Revisited</em></a>). I have many, many fond memories of <em>EarthBound</em>. Sure, the graphics may appear very dated by today&#8217;s standards, but I am certain the humor and story will hold up pretty well. I first heard about <em>EarthBound</em> via the gaming magazine <em>Nintendo Power</em> &#8212; I had a subscription back in those glory days of the Nintendo Entertainment System, all the way through Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>I remember ads for <em>Earthbound</em> in <em>Nintendo Power</em> really grabbing my attention, there was one ad which discussed the effect on players, as if it were a medical study of some sort. One &#8220;player&#8221; was quoted as saying &#8220;all of my friends are in there&#8221; (or something close to it) upon being forced to turn the game off.</p>
<p>For some reason, this bit of advertising worked on me. I <em>had</em> to play this game. Any game so addicting <em>must</em> be good, right? <em>EarthBound</em> was released in the states a month and change before my 14th birthday, so once my coffers were laden with birthday cash, I promptly bought the game.</p>
<p><em>EarthBound</em> was unique in that it came packaged with a player&#8217;s guide (which I still have). I don&#8217;t know why this was the case, other than perhaps Nintendo felt <em>EarthBound</em> was such a quirky game, they needed to lure folks in with something. <em>EarthBound</em> certainly was quirky for an RPG: it took place in 1990s America, the main characters were all kids, and it was not the typical fantasy setting for most RPGs of the time (you use ATMs for money and could order a pizza delivery over the phone).</p>
<p>And all of these reasons were why I loved <em>EarthBound</em> from the instant I started playing. I grew attached to the four main characters: Ness, Paula, Jeff and Poo. Unlike some other RPGs, you only used these four characters throughout the entire game. Swapping out party members with different abilities gets old for me after awhile, which <a title="Geek Speak – Final Fantasy Revisited part 5" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/01/27/geek-speak-final-fantasy-revisited-part-5/">I talked about at length</a> during my <em>FFVII</em> play-through:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe that is why <em>EarthBound</em> is another of my all time favorite RPGs: you get a set amount of characters and each has their own special ability. It may seem pretty vanilla to some, but it does help one become more attached to the characters (maybe).</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the graphics were &#8220;cutesy&#8221; and &#8220;cartoony,&#8221; but it only added to the charm. It certainly complimented the humor, which spent plenty of time poking fun at American culture. But, any game with a Blues Brothers-like band (The Runaway Five) as supporting characters will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
<p>On the game&#8217;s humor, from <a title="Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Described by <a title="Gamasutra" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> as &#8220;a warped, confused tribute to American culture, designed by people who&#8217;ve only experienced the country through books and movies&#8221; the quirky humor of the game is one of the chief reasons for its popularity.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amongst the ranks of absurd enemies in the game Ness must face down New Age Retro Hippies, Pogo Punks, Extra Cranky Ladies, and Big Piles of Puke throughout his quest. Much of the dialogue and plot of the game pokes fun at traditional RPG and sci-fi clichés. Even the advertising campaign played off of its humor, with the slogan &#8220;This game stinks&#8221;, referring to the scratch and sniff stickers that were included in the <em><a title="Nintendo Player's Guide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Player%27s_Guide">Player&#8217;s Guide</a></em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember those scratch and sniff stickers &#8212; and some of the humor in the Player&#8217;s Guide was just as fun as the game. It made for an entertaining read.</p>
<p>I am ready &#8212; and after playing the super-complex <em>Front Mission 4</em> over the summer, I am eager for a simpler game to occupy my chilly Autumn evenings. It is time for psychic powers, baseball bats, Apple Kid, and Mr. Saturn.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe that I&#8217;ve admitted in the past, with almost a perverse sense of pride, that I&#8217;m one of those people who buys the strategy guide. (Or at least tries to look at it. Building a collection of strategy guides would be crazy expensive.) I&#8217;ve backed off a bit in recent years, but only because sites like <a target="new" href="http://ign.com">IGN.com</a> make guides available for free on their websites. (I know! Free! I love it.)</p>
<p>Some of you will point out that individuals have ben posting walkthroughs on the internet for years. I will respond by calling you heathens and accuse you of probably downloading illegal ROMs as well, but that&#8217;s another column. (Just to be clear, I&#8217;ve used amateur walkthroughs. And I have mixed feelings about ROMs. Don&#8217;t send me hate mail.)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3290" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/27/ffvii-guided-strategy/51waqqmigal/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/51waqqmigal.jpg" data-orig-size="357,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="51waQQmIgAL" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/51waqqmigal.jpg?w=214" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/51waqqmigal.jpg?w=357" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/51waqqmigal.jpg?w=214&#038;h=300" alt="strategy guide" title="51waQQmIgAL" width="214" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3290" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/51waqqmigal.jpg?w=214&amp;h=300 214w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/51waqqmigal.jpg?w=107&amp;h=150 107w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/51waqqmigal.jpg 357w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px" /> But to add to the authenticity of our retro-playthrough, I went old-school and ordered a physical copy of the <em>FFVII</em> strategy guide from Amazon. It sits open on my lap as I play, evoking memories of <em>FFX</em>, <em>FFX-2</em>, and more recently, <em>FFXIII</em>.</p>
<p>But just as the games have developed over the years, so have the strategy guides. I&#8217;d never been sent wrong before, but the Bradygames <em>FFVII</em> guide isn&#8217;t perfect. It recommended that I bypass buying Barret a Cannonball weapon, instead suggesting that I look for the Custom Sweeper enemy outside of Kalm and steal the more powerful Atomic Scissors.</p>
<p>Sounds great. Except that you don&#8217;t run into Custom Sweepers outside of Kalm. You run into them outside of Midgar. And unless you&#8217;re really lucky, you have to run into a lot of them before you&#8217;ll be able to successfully steal an Atomic Scissors. I don&#8217;t have time for that, and I&#8217;ve spent nearly six hours of game time with a seriously underpowered Barret because of that bad advice.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s far, far worse. The guide spoils plot points. Even given the PS1-era date of its composition, this is unbelievable. I know enough already about what happens in the game that I&#8217;m not really worried about the guide reducing the quality of my experience, but if this were 1997, I&#8217;d be livid. Most of the guides I&#8217;ve used were written long after the <em>FFVII</em> guide, but it&#8217;s actually really easy to write a guide that doesn&#8217;t spoil plot points. You get 90% of the way there just by <em>not talking about cutscenes</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to move along a bit in the game. I&#8217;m almost to the Gold Saucer, which means that I&#8217;m nearly to where Daniel was after his holiday break gaming binge. I haven&#8217;t felt under-leveled, but I&#8217;ve suffered from a chronic shortage of gil, especially after my successful but expensive battle at Fort Condor.</p>
<p>I do have a question for you, Daniel and Andrew: do you normally try to spread your leveling out among characters, or do you basically pick a couple of characters and just let those three get as strong as possible as quickly as possible by ignoring everyone else? (I&#8217;m spreading out my leveling now, but I&#8217;m tempted by the thought of letting just a couple of characters keep up with Cloud.) </p>
<p>Onward!</p>
