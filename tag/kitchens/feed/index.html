										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has their own way of finding order. Maybe you wash your hands until they are cracked to keep from catching something. Maybe you vacuum the entire house every day. Maybe you fold your underwear and sort them by color. Maybe you organize your books by size. Each is a way to find order and to sort things in our brains until they make sense. My bookshelf is packed with books whichever way they can fit &#8212; vaguely alphabetical, mostly unorganized and messy-looking, some books even laying horizontally on top of the others. I don’t care very much to keep my bedroom neat. In my head I’d like a beautiful, Better Homes and Gardens-type bedroom, but in reality it’s just much easier to close the door when people come over.</p>
<p>I find order in a clean and organized kitchen. Cooking anything is so much better when you don’t have to clean off the countertop first. In our kitchen, we have a mishmash of plates and bowls from different sets. I stack them so that the dishes from the same set are together. Cups are organized by size &#8212; juice glasses, wine glasses, water cups, tall glasses. Mugs are in the cabinet over the coffeemaker. Water bottles sit on top of the refrigerator. Pots and pans are stacked in the cupboard by size. Even the spoons in their compartment are divided because I use the big spoons and the little spoons for different things (small for ice cream and desserts, or for stirring coffee, things I want to savor; big for huge bites of cereal or for mixing).</p>
<p>When things are messy or out of order it makes me feel dirty and my brain feel all scrambled. This is a challenge in a shared kitchen where no one else is as anal as me. Here are my rules for keeping the kitchen in order. I&#8217;ve never been brave enough to actually tell them to anyone because I know it&#8217;s no one else&#8217;s business but mine to keep my brain in order, and I don&#8217;t want to be THAT GIRL.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t leave dishes in the sink</strong>. If there isn&#8217;t a dishwasher, then we can talk. But if there is a dishwasher, fucking put the dishes in it. It’s RIGHT THERE. Don’t leave your half-eaten bowl of cereal to get soggy, the old milk mixing with dirty dishwater and the food you rinse off later. Don’t let the dishes pile up so much that you’re unable to use the faucet. By that point, the food will have gotten so crusty that the dishwasher won’t do any good and you’ll have to rewash them by hand anyway. Just. Put them in the dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t leave food in the sink</strong>. Good job; you’ve cleaned the dishes out of the sink. But at that point you must have gotten distracted because there are bits of food still hanging out in there. This is where you’re supposed to <em>clean</em> dishes. How can they be clean if there’s still food from who knows when in the sink? Fucking rinse out the sink.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t load the dishwasher like an asshole</strong>. The dishwasher is a beautiful appliance. It’s meant for plates and bowls and glasses, NOT for the bowl in which you mixed pancake batter this morning. It’s also not meant for the pan you used to fry bacon. All the dishes will come out with little dried-on batter bits or will end up slimy, and you’ll have to run the machine again. Do you like doing dishes twice? I fucking don’t. Load the dishwasher like a logical human being so that as many dishes can fit in as possible. Maybe consider putting the plates in rows. There are even little holders for them! I’d much rather wash a few pots and pans than ten plates. Don’t be an asshole. Think ahead for maybe five seconds before you put things in the dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t leave spills</strong>. Everyone’s in a hurry, but it’s way easier to wipe up that coffee you just spilled. Otherwise you’ll have to scrub it off later, and by then who knows what’s happened to it. Does coffee curdle? I’d rather not find out. I don’t want to be scraping unidentified substances off the countertop with my fingernails.</p>
<p>Lest you think I’m using this column as a passive-aggressive way to call out current and former roommates, these are rules that I sometimes break, too. Sometimes I really just don’t want to wash the dishes right away and would rather lay on the couch instead. But there is nothing like a clean sink, a full cupboard, and a stack of clean bowls to make me feel like things are the way they should be. So, internet, these are the rules I use to keep order. What are yours?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the spirit of Labor Day, I’ve done as little cooking as possible. I did cook up some <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/28/broiler-alert-salmon/">salmon</a> for the boyfriend, so that he doesn’t completely despair that I’ll ever cook him a nice dinner again. Also I like salmon.</p>
<p>As I’ve been unpacking boxes and outfitting my new kitchen, every day is like Christmas because I rediscover kitchen utensils I’d forgotten about. Hello, crockpot. Hello, cute and tiny mixing bowls. Welcome home.</p>
<p>Since our storage space is minimal and since I’ve lived in my own place since 2007, I’m finally starting to get a handle on the things I actually need in order to cook. I had a conversation with someone recently about what’s necessary in the kitchen, so in lieu of actually doing anything, I decided to write up a quick guide for the things you should have in yours (silverware and cups and plates aside, obviously).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=large,+deep+skillet&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=17847347106251670964&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6u9jTr6jA7HKiALsoN2TCg&amp;ved=0CFAQ8wIwAw">A large, deep, nonstick skillet</a></strong>. If you’re lazy like me and you like to cook things using one pan, this is necessary. Cook some chicken, throw in some veggies (or not), add sauce, done. The deep sides are helpful if you’re not just frying or sautéing, and if you get overzealous like me and splash your sauces everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>A blender</strong>. Even just a cheap $10 one. Smoothies, soups, and, you know, margaritas. All necessary. You know how I feel about soup—it’s cheap to make and the leftovers are just as good. A blender’s important for creamy, non-broth-based soups. I love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CSB-77-Blender-Chopper-Attachments/dp/B0006G3JRO">stick blender</a> and use it weekly.</li>
<li><strong>A crockpot</strong>. After getting this as a Christmas gift, I’ve used it to make multiple soups and even <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/06/20/the-day-long-barbecue/">ribs</a>. It’s the ultimate lazy chef’s tool—put stuff in it, then walk away for eight hours, and come back to perfectly cooked and tender meat or ready-to-eat soup. If you cook on low, it’s almost impossible to screw up.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/stainless-steel-spoon-rest/"><strong>A spoon rest</strong></a>. I never even realized that this was a thing until Charlie brought one from his mom’s house when we moved in together. But seriously, it saves you from having to clean up your stove and/or countertop every single time you cook. Plus it makes you look fancy.</li>
<li><strong>Spices/herbs</strong>. Specifically, salt, pepper, paprika, cinnamon, and garlic powder. I’ve acquired lots of other spices that I hardly ever use (hello, cumin and cream of tartar), but these are the ones that can make a difference if something is tasting really boring. I swear by <a href="http://www.gourmetgarden.com/us/contents/view/Herbs-and-Spices">Gourmet Garden’s refrigerated herb blends</a> because they keep for months in the fridge (fresh herbs, not so much) and require zero prep time. I started buying these after about five parsley and basil purchases that rotted in my produce drawer after I used one sprig. I use the red pepper and ginger blends constantly. Who wants to spend their time grating ginger? Not me.</li>
<li><strong>Fresh garlic</strong>. Fresh garlic has to be one of the best things to cook because of how delicious it makes your kitchen smell. I add fresh garlic to pretty much any Italian or chicken-based dish I make. In other news, our apartment is vampire-free.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are your most essential kitchen items? (I’ll go ahead and add them to my Christmas list.) Enjoy your Labor day, dear readers—eat, be merry, and do nothing at all.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello from the west coast, dear readers, where I wake up three hours later than most of my friends and every day begins foggy and ends up clear-skied and perfect.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello from the west coast, dear readers, where I wake up three hours later than most of my friends and every day begins foggy and ends up clear-skied and perfect. My boxes are mostly unpacked, except for those ones labeled “?” and “I don’t even know.” (True story.) I sometimes look out the window and expect to see the apartment next door in Boston, only to see blue skies and palm trees. I forget where I am. But I like it here, wherever it is.</p>
<p>Our apartment is tiny, and we don’t have room for a dining room table, so instead we eat sitting across from each other on the couch or at the bar in the kitchen. It feels as cute as college all over again. We plan to get a table for the patio so we can look out at the palm trees and feel all California while we eat.</p>
<p>I’m unemployed, so I’ve yet to make myself stick to a schedule. After the long drive, I spent most of two days on the couch recovering by watching episode after episode of <em>Dexter</em>. I eat cereal in the morning, soup or a sandwich for lunch, and whatever Charlie cooks for dinner. I’m a little lost without my routine. At dinnertime, I tend to sit on the couch and apologize while Charlie does the cooking. He’s a good man, so he never complains, but after reading about all the things I cooked in Boston while he was in California, I must be somewhat of a disappointment.</p>
<p>We’re getting used to sharing an eating schedule again. I like to plan my meals ahead of time; Charlie tends to eat whatever’s in the fridge or whip something up from whatever we have in the pantry. Leftover spaghetti? Great. Omelettes for dinner? Perfect. We don’t feel like cooking? Order some pizzas. Watch more <em>Dexter</em>. I’m the opposite. Example: Yesterday we went to a chili cookoff. While we were waiting in line, before we ate any chili, I was wondering about dinner. I think about my next <em>next</em> meal before I’ve even eaten this one. This morning, though, while we were brushing our teeth, Charlie asked, “What should we have for dinner?”</p>
<p>Because our apartment is newly remodeled, the kitchen is gorgeous and brand-new and FREAKING AWESOME. Go ahead and call me lame, but one of the best parts of this kitchen is that the end of the faucet comes off and works as a sprayer. Cleaning requires little to no effort. (The best kind of effort, obviously.)</p>

<p>Because the apartment’s tiny, storage space is at a minimum. Some shelves are narrow and a good home for nothing but cutting boards and elves. There’s no pantry, so Charlie had set all the cereal boxes and canned food out on the long shelf. It made my obsessive-compulsive need for orderly piles go haywire. I suggested moving the plates and cups out of the cabinets and moving the food in. Plates and cups are inherently prettier. After the switch, the kitchen is indeed prettier and I feel less like tearing my hair out. However, the San Andreas Fault is about 15 minutes west of us. Earthquakes happen all the time, small ones we can barely feel and sometimes bigger ones we can. We haven’t felt one yet, but I’m just waiting for the day I ask Charlie to stop moving the bed and for him to tell me he’s not.</p>
<p>We have wineglasses sitting on an open shelf. Would it be smarter to put them in a cabinet? Probably. But the kitchen looks so adorable with the wineglasses and matching plates that we just can’t bring ourselves to be intelligent and put them somewhere low. We’ll compromise by not hanging anything over the bed. I&#8217;ll have to get used to cooking with the electric stove, rather than the gas I’m used to. But as Charlie pointed out, electric stoves are much safer, you know, in the event of an earthquake. No gas lines means a smaller chance of fire. So, there’s that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have a coupon for free cupcakes downtown. Perfect for an unemployed food writer. Let cupcakes and not earthquakes guide me home.</p>
