										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strangely enough, the genre description “deliberately artificial romantic melodrama slash Thai western” don’t do justice to Wisit Sasanatieng’s 2000 film <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em>. The film is a postmodern pastiche of the most shallow and wonderful kind: ambitious, energetic, and entertaining, combining disparate clichés, both narrative and visual, to form something new and unique. </p>
<p>When the film opens, Dum (pronounced like Dahm, so it’s not really that funny) and Mahesuan, two gunmen dressed like parodies of cowboy tourists, assault a country house, shooting and killing everyone inside.  We learn that Dum, the eponymous Black Tiger, and Mahesuan are the right hand men of Fai, an outlaw whose band terrorizes the Thai countryside.  Meanwhile, a young woman, Rumpoey, waits in a lagoon gazebo for someone who never arrives; when she gazes at a photograph of the lover who has jilted her, we see it is Dum.  Dum arrives too late for their rendezvous, and Rumpoey returns home to be engaged to Kumjorn, a respectable and ambitious police captain. </p>

<p>Kumjorn, eager to prove himself, suggests to Rumpoey’s father, the governor, an attack on Fai and his men. The attack goes well for the police &#8212; that is, until Dum and Mahesuan return from a night of drunken revelry, in which they pledged blood brotherhood to each other. Kumjorn is captured, but Dum takes pity on him and lets him escape when he learns Kumjorn is betrothed to Rumpoey. Obviously, this sets in motion a love triangle between Dum, Kumjorn, and Rampoey, and sets Dum and Mahesuan against each other when Fai becomes suspicious of the infamous Black Tiger’s motives. </p>
<p>In classic melodramatic tradition, the plot is both deceptively simple and convoluted, as my description might suggest &#8212; and it leaves out the last third of the movie, as well as the flashback sequences where we learn how Dum and Rumpoey first met and fell in love. It trades in familiar narrative tropes and character types: the love triangle, romance between different social classes, the honorable outlaw, brothers (actual or figurative) set against one another by fate.  Complementing those well-tread narrative pathways, <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em> utilizes an expressive and inventive aesthetic cobbled together from past visual styles. The bright, saturated color schema and slight haze recalls the cheap color systems used in imitation of Technicolor by Indian and other Asian cinemas of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. The garish red of the blood reminds one of the thick splashes of Hammer horror films.  The musical leitmotif that follows the outlaw cowboys imitates Ennio Morricone’s Western themes, while the scenes between Dum and Rumpoey feature Max Steiner-like romantic swells.  </p>

<p>The purpose of this pastiche seems to be the deliberate interrogation of older styles and forms of filmmaking.  The artifice commonplace to classical filmmaking, but passé now &#8212; sets used for outdoor locations, over-emotive performances, rear projection driving &#8212; are not only used in <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em>, but made blindingly obvious to the viewer. The flashback to Dum and Rumpoey’s childhood even begins with a sequence that parodies silent film parodies, complete with overcranked projector speed, missing frames, and artificially induced dust and scratches. </p>
<p>A scene between Dum and Rumpoey as children offers a possible answer to the questions raised. At the gazebo where Rumpoey will later wait for him, only to be disappointed, Dum tells her a folktale about the builder of the gazebo. He was a woodcutter who fell in love with a wealthy girl, and built the structure as a monument to her beauty. When the girl’s father learned of her plan to run away and marry the woodcutter, he locked her away in their house, where she hanged herself in despair. Obviously the folktale is meant to resonate with the film’s main storyline of a socially unacceptable pairing and its potential for a tragic conclusion. I would offer, however, that this scene is key to understanding the film as a broader piece of work.  Its relationship to older models of filmmaking casts them as a kind of folktale storytelling, not meant to be naturalistic, but rather to conjure up modes of feeling and aesthetic appreciation unrelated to the quotidian modern. Those moments of artifice and of cinematic excess are clues to the viewer, telling us this is just a story, and just as the film echoes Dum’s folktale, attesting to its lessons, <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em> evokes the cinematic past to remind us of the truths embedded therein.  </p>

Inside, Martha maintains the home with the kind of meticulous attention produced by willfully ignoring something else. Eliza Hopkins was Martha&#8217;s good friend and, as a stranger in a strange land, perhaps her only one.</p>
<p>Captain Stanley must prove to her that he can make this right. That they can be happy here. That all is not lost.  Meanwhile, Charlie rides.</p>
<p>He visits the graves of the Hopkins family, lingering at Eliza&#8217;s tombstone. He comes across a drunk old man named Jellon Lamb (an excellent John Hurt), who eventually reveals himself to be a bounty hunter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are white men, sir, not beasts. Oh, he sits up there in those melancholy hills; some say he sleeps in caves like a beast, slumbers deep like the Kraken. The Blacks say that he is a spirit. The Troopers will never catch him. Common force is meaningless, Mr. Murphy, as he squats up there on his impregnable perch. So I wait, Mr. Murphy. I wait.</p></blockquote>
<p>Charlie knows who Lamb is after.  It is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The two men part. Charlie is attacked and wounded by Aborigines. When he awakes, he discovers that he&#8217;s been rescued by his former gang, including Arthur himself, who has taken to perching on cliff tops and watching the sun rise. Arthur is intelligent, which makes him all the more dangerous, and one gets the impression that his nearly legendary status in this region was probably carefully crafted by none other than himself.</p>
<p>The brothers reunite, and Arthur reveals his skills are not limited to violence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Love. Love is the key. Love and family. For what are night and day, the sun, the moon, the stars without love, and those you love around you? What could be more hollow than to die alone, unloved?</p></blockquote>
<p>Arthur regards Charlie (and the world) from a cold distance.  It is as though he is merely waiting for Charlie to do what he knows must be done.  There is a scene where Arthur has shot Jellon Lamb in the back to defend Charlie.  As Lamb sits dying, he mutters some words from author George Borrow, which Arthur acknowledges before stabbing him in the heart.  Then, he hears the click of Charlie&#8217;s gun.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can&#8217;t you ever just&#8230; stop me, Charlie?</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in town Captain Stanley has lost his tenuous control.  An example will be made of Mikey Burns by flogging him in the middle of town. 100 lashes.  It will surely kill him. Street justice is better than no justice at all, but Captain Stanley knows what this means. His proposition is null and void, and Arthur will be coming for them.</p>
<p>Soon, the brutality that lies just beyond the Stanley&#8217;s makeshift fence is kicking in their front door. Arthur does not necessarily seek revenge.  He seeks an excuse to unleash his demons on others. And when Charlie finally shoots his brother neither of them is particularly surprised.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not the stomach, Charlie.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Like <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, <em>The Proposition</em> explores humanity in the face of unchecked violence.  No matter how hard Captain Stanley campaigns to &#8220;civilize this land,&#8221; his battle has already been lost. This is never more obvious than when he releases his Aboriginal servant, who says his goodbyes, strolls to the edge of their property and places his shoes by the fence before heading out into the wild.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;How?&#8221; said the sun that melted the ground</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said the river that refused to run</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Where?&#8221; said the thunder without a sound</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said the rider and took up his gun</em></p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[I bought Rockstar Games’ <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> the day it came out, May 18, 2010, and I just finished it this past weekend. Of course, <em>I</em> say that I finished the game. The game itself seems to think that I’m only 85.4% done. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> doesn't end when the credits roll. You can just keep going if you want, playing poker, hunting, gathering rare herbs, helping or assaulting people as your wont may be. I will admit to having done a little of all of these things.

We'll see you around.</p></div>I bought Rockstar Games’ <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> the day it came out, May 18, 2010, and I just finished it this past weekend. Of course, <em>I</em> say that I finished the game. The game itself seems to think that I’m only 85.4% done. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> doesn&#8217;t end when the credits roll. You can just keep going if you want, playing poker, hunting, gathering rare herbs, helping or assaulting people as your wont may be. I will admit to having done a little of all of these things.</p>
<p>To readers and fellow gamers mired in the southern portion of the game’s virtual geography, I say “press on!” After the initial “New Austin” portion of the storyline, the &#8220;Mexico&#8221; chapters are a bit of a disappointment. Progress is more tentative. The clichés are more offensive. Even though the territory is smaller, one seems to spend more time in transit on one’s horse. There’s an ill-advised stealth portion of the game with unreasonably lethal throwing knives. (Seriously, it can take a couple of shots to stop a guy who&#8217;s trying to kill you, but one throwing knife in the back puts your man down, every time. Are the things poisoned? The game never says anything about poison.)</p>
<p>But when you come back to the US, and gain access to the “West Elizabeth” territory (which is actually the easternmost potion of the game’s geography. Go figure), it’s all worth it. This is where <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>’s early hints that it wants to be a game about the end of the West and the conflict between the open frontier and creeping industrialized bureaucracy really come to fruition. [Let it be said that there are rather severe <strong>SPOILERS AHEAD</strong>, but if you really want some quality spoilers, go to the <a href="http://reddead.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Dead_Wiki">Red Dead Wiki</a>. It’s pretty fabulous.]</p>
<p>Suddenly, in West Elizabeth’s largest town, Blackwater, it starts to feel like 1911 and not the 1870s. The streets are paved. You take a ride in (and make fun of) a car, which, of course, breaks down at a critical moment. You’re able to purchase a pretty sweet full-automatic German Mauser pistol, and you finally get to work face-to-face with the corrupt federal agent who&#8217;s been pulling your strings. (He’s been hovering in the background during the early portions of the game.) But most importantly, after all this, you do actually get your family back. <em>And that’s not where the game ends.</em> </p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_346" style="width: 276px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-346" data-attachment-id="346" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/08/339/palerider6/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/palerider6.jpg" data-orig-size="266,200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PaleRider6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/palerider6.jpg?w=266" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/palerider6.jpg?w=266" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/palerider6.jpg?w=640" alt="Pale Rider" title="PaleRider6"   class="size-full wp-image-346" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/palerider6.jpg 266w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/palerider6.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px" /><p id="caption-attachment-346" class="wp-caption-text">He'll take your confession, and offer the absolution of cold steel</p></div>My fondness for the last portion of the game can be at least partially explained by the fact that my favorite Western of all time is <em>Pale Rider</em>, and not the Clint Eastwood part of the film (which is, admittedly, pretty awesome), but the Michael Moriarty part of the film. The Clint Eastwood part of the film is about a guy who is probably dead and come back as an angel of death to take retribution on the bad men who killed him and are now hurting other people. Clint puts on a priest’s collar at one point, but he deals out far more ass-kicking than spiritual guidance. Michael Moriarty, on the other hand, is a prospector who is trying to pull his fellow prospectors into some sort of community and build a family with a woman who starts lusting hard after Clint as soon as he rides into town (her daughter too. Lusts after Clint, that is). Moriarty has a nice moment with a shotgun at the end of the film, but mostly he’s the quiet guy with the resolve to pull everyone together. (Did I mention that film is about mining instead of ranching? Not a cow in sight. Brilliant.)</p>
<p>After riding all over the West, killing and being shot at, John Marston gets to go home to his own property and try to reconnect with his family. Even though I knew it was coming, John’s reunion with his wife, Abigail was surprisingly affecting. Abigail, when you meet her, is a great character. She loves John, but she won&#8217;t take any shit from anyone, especially him. She has as much of a past as John does&mdash;she was a &#8220;working girl&#8221; who ran with old gang John has just killed off, and she has mixed feelings about that. In short, she&#8217;s a character worth all of the trouble you&#8217;ve just gone through. (Compare, say, to <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, in its various incarnations. What did Toadstool or Peach ever do for you?) The scene where Abigail meets Bonnie McFarlane, the rancher who saved John’s life and is more than a little sweet on him, is perfectly played. The two women have a lot in common, and like each other. The only sign of Bonnie’s feelings is the way the camera (can we call it the camera?&mdash;the game’s view) lingers on Bonnie as she watches John and Abigail drive away. It’s heartbreaking.</p>

Sandbox games like <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> constantly have to balance the creation of a dynamic where the user can do whatever he wants with the constraints necessary to maintain some semblance of narrative and character consistency. While <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> offers the player a great deal of flexibility as to how violent or how law-abiding John Marston is going to be, the character is written as unwaveringly faithful to his wife. New Austin is full of &#8220;working women,&#8221; but John constantly reaffirms that he&#8217;s a married man. He does not and cannot flirt with Bonnie Marston.  Marston may not exactly be Michael Moriarty in <em>Pale Rider</em>, but he wants to be. Once he goes home and puts on his rancher&#8217;s clothes, he never wears anything else. (The player literally loses the ability to change Marston into different outfits at that point of the game.) He herds cattle. He teaches his son to hunt. He shoots wolves and crows instead of people. He finds a different life, for just a little while.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite <em>Unforgiven</em>, but it&#8217;s worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence.</p>
<p>If I had one complaint (other than Mexico), it’s that I’d like to be able to bump into the characters from the main storyline again in the game’s coda. (You are given brief updates on what happens to most of them in a newspaper you can purchase. Do.) I’d like to know what happens to McFarlane and her ranch. I’d like to get to see her meet Marston’s son. I’ve made an emotional connection with these characters, and that’s an extraordinary thing to be able to say about a game.</p>
