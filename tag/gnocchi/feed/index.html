										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like to think I can work hard on some things, but for the most part, I’ll take the lazy route if you let me. So lately my cooking has consisted of an arsenal of 10 dinners or so and just cycling through them, week after week. Finding a new recipe takes <em>time</em> and then having to go find and buy new ingredients takes even more time, not to mention disproportionate anxiety. Instead I could keep rewatching <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> or read one of the seven books I just bought. Cooking is work.</p>
<p>But I started to get sick of those recipes. We always keep a few packages of shelf-stable gnocchi in the cupboard to make <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/06/06/vegetable-challenge-what-the-h-is-chard/">gnocchi with chard and white beans</a>, but when I went to make it last week, I realized I was groaning about the idea of eating it <em>again.</em> That recipe makes a TON of leftovers that don’t taste as good as the fresh stuff, and I just did not want to be eating that shit for the next week. Not to mention the sort of middle-aged sadness of doing the same thing over and over again and aren’t I supposed to be young and doing new things and OMG WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. Eventually the fear of monotony won out over my lazy ass, and I decided to break out of the rut and find something new.</p>
<p>None of that changes the fact that I already had gnocchi in my cupboard and that gnocchi is delicious. Lately I’ve been sidelined from working out by a fucking TOE injury, so I’ve been trying to eat more vegetables to keep myself from losing all the health. I normally sauté some zucchini in olive oil when I make <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/28/broiler-alert-salmon/" target="_blank">honey-soy broiled salmon</a>, but otherwise I have no idea what to do with it. I found <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/gnocchi_with_zucchini_ribbons_parsley_brown_butter.html" target="_blank">this recipe</a> for gnocchi with zucchini ribbons (?) and parley brown butter from eatingwell.com. I had no idea what zucchini ribbons were or how butter got brown, but it sounded pretty so I went with it.</p>
<p>I wanted to get out of the rut but I’m still lazy, so I also chose this recipe because it doesn’t have a lot of ingredients: zucchini, tomatoes, gnocchi, parsley, butter, parmesan cheese, some spices, and I swapped out the shallots for garlic because ew shallots. To make the zucchini ribbony, the recipe said to use a mandoline slicer. I have no idea what that is, so I just used a potato peeler. I sliced off the ends of the zucchini first so I could stand it up, and cut thin slices downward until I got to the seeds. I didn’t expect mine to look as good as the picture, but they did look pretty cute, if sort of unsettlingly fish-like.  I chopped everything else up while I boiled the gnocchi.</p>

<p>Next, I had to brown the butter. The recipe said to cook it for about two minutes until it starts to brown. That sounded straightforward until I actually started doing it, and then I got worried that “brown” was too close to burn and that I wouldn’t know the difference and then EVERYTHING would be RUINED. While the butter started to melt, I furiously started googling “what does browned butter look like please help” and found something of Alton Brown’s. Most people on the internet, including Alton, seemed to be browning huge pots of butter for some nefarious purpose, whereas I was only doing a tiny slice.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of running between my computer and the stove, I decided to wing it. I waited until after the butter was foamy, when it looked maybe a little bit golden, and decided that was good enough for me. Anything cooked in butter is going to taste fine, anyhow. I added in the cute zucchini:</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_9804" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9804" data-attachment-id="9804" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/21/butter-browned/100_2074/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg" data-orig-size="3648,2736" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE Z1012 IS Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1335775807&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.85&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="100_2074" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=640" class="size-full wp-image-9804" title="100_2074" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=960 1280w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/100_2074.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9804" class="wp-caption-text">Aw.</p></div>
<p>From then on, the rest of the recipe moved super quickly, only cooking each ingredient for a minute or two before adding the next. The strangest thing about this recipe was that it wanted me to add nutmeg. NUTMEG. Isn’t that like, for coffee and hot cider and desserts? But I figured the people at Eating Well probably know what they’re doing, so I stirred it in along with a few red pepper flakes, like some of the commenters suggested.</p>

<p>LADIES AND GENTS &#8212; I cannot tell you how effing tasty this is. I don’t know whether it was the nutmeg or if browning the butter makes it extra delicious, but it was so good I made it again the next night. The recipe is supposed to be 4 servings but Charlie and I ate the entire panful in one sitting. The zucchini hardly tastes like a vegetable at all; it was almost like a sort of noodle. Even the picky 8-year-old version of me could probably have been tricked into eating this. I might use a little bit less parsley next time, but even that is barely worth mentioning. Instead of being my usual modest self I could not shut up about how good this was and how awesome I am. I was happy to be out of my rut, but I’ll gladly climb into a new, butter-filled one.</p>

<p>I tidied the kitchen in a five-second whirlwind, as if that would help, and moved my liquored-up coffee mug from one place to another to keep my grandparents from smelling it. I went forward to hug them, glancing over my shoulder at the spread of ingredients not even close to being in the pan. “You’re so early!” I babbled. My grandmother shrugged. “Why?” she joked, “is that a problem?” “No, no, of course not!” I squealed. “It’s great to see you even earlier than we expected.” My grandma patted me on the shoulder and said, “Well, good, dear.”</p>
<p>Even though it was my mom’s kitchen, my grandmother somehow ended up standing at the sink, rinsing fruit and taking down serving platters for her desserts. Because my mother’s mother died before I was born, I sometimes forget that my grandma is actually her stepmom. My mother and grandma love each other, get along well, and have been a family for years, but there is always the fact that my grandma is not the mother my mom lost to cancer when she was my age. She’s always been my grandmother, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve started noticing when everything isn’t all Easter egg hunts and harmonious cooking side by side and unicorns and rainbows. Instead of wondering if my grandma stepping right into my mom’s kitchen would be tense, I took a big swig out of my mug, and started cooking.</p>
<p>The recipe was moving along despite the lack of fresh garlic. While my mom showed my grandparents her garden, I rinsed and hid the diced tomato cans, hoping my grandma would go ahead and assume I’d used fresh ones. They came back in and loitered around, chatting behind me, while I sweated over the stove. While I wilted the chard, I was mostly conscious of my coffee mug. I’d never drank so much as a glass of wine in front of my grandparents before. We never drink at all on holidays, but here it was 12:30 on a Friday afternoon, and I was having some drank before a luncheon. Perfect.</p>
<p>I’m sure they asked me some questions about my move and I think my grandpa was trying to figure out what in the hell gnocchi actually is, but my brain chose to focus on the Irish coffee in my hand, rather than the food. It was easier to imagine my grandparents scolding me for the drink than for the food. I tossed back the last of the coffee, mopped up my sweaty forehead, and announced lunch.</p>
<p>We all sat down, passed around bread and salad and fruit, and waited. I waited and waited in agony for someone to dip the ladle into the mess of cheese and pasta. Finally my grandpa served himself, then my grandma. Everyone ate, and no one said anything. I’m not above asking if it’s good, knowing that people will say what I want to hear, but I wanted honesty. So I waited.</p>
<p>We talked about my move to California, and my grandpa told stories. He told us about the time he and my mother’s mother were trying to sell their house, and they’d secured a buyer. The man had paid $500, and my grandpa had gone to Tucscon for a medical treatment. While he was gone, the man returned to my grandparents’ house. He wanted the money back. When my mother’s mom refused, he threatened to punch her in the mouth, and left. She called my grandpa crying, and he drove in a rage all the way from Tucscon back to Michigan in 36 hours, directly to the man’s house. When he answered the door, my grandpa confirmed that it was the right man, then punched him so hard that he went flying off the porch. My grandpa left him in the dirt and went home to his wife. My grandpa brandished his fist in the air, and my mother laughed. “He has plenty more stories like that,” she said. “You don’t disrespect dad’s.” My grandma laughed, too. “Oh, I’m not afraid of you,” she said. He winked and put his hand on her thigh. She looked at him and smiled.</p>
<p>Then my grandpa took another spoonful of the gnocchi. Then my grandma took another spoonful. I missed the handle of my coffee cup. The food hadn’t tasted all that great to me, but food never does when you cook it for yourself. I wanted the food to mean more than it possibly could; I wanted it to say hello, I love you, be well, be filled, goodbye, but not forever. Even as I filled up my dessert plate, I thought that it might not be about the food at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The problem with trying to eat more vegetables is that vegetables are pretty gross. Once I went public with my non-vegetable ways, I received lots and lots of recipes suggesting I drown the veggies in cheese or butter and <em>voila! </em>now I’d have eaten some veggies. But kids, you <em>know</em> that that doesn’t count. If I’m going to drench something in butter I’d rather make some cookies. There <em>have</em> to be recipes for cooking with vegetables that keep their nutritional benefits without making me feel like I’m punishing myself for something.</p>
<p>But after much searching and too many soups, I think I may have found one. I was poking around on <em>Eating Well</em>’s website and stumbled across this recipe for <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/skillet_gnocchi_with_chard_white_beans.html">skillet gnocchi with chard and white beans</a>. Gnocchi was invented because god loves us and wants us to be happy. It’s pasta made from potatoes. I’ve been trying to eat more non-dairy protein, so the white beans were an added bonus. The rest was negligible. Nothing could ruin gnocchi.</p>
<p>The next step was to figure out what the hell chard was. To me it sounded like something tasteless that you chew like gum. From the picture on the recipe, I guessed that it was some sort of leafy vegetable. At the grocery store, I stood in the produce section and stared at all the leafy bundles. I tried to read all the names of what was what without touching every single bunch, but it was impossible. I picked each one up and peered at its name, trying to find the mysterious chard and trying not to think about how many other people had probably touched it before me.</p>
<p>There it was! Red chard, looking rather like spinach but with longer stalks and a radish hue. The recipe said I needed a “small bunch,” but all the bunches looked insanely large. If I ever write my own recipe, I’m going to be more specific. “A bunch the size of a purse-sized Chihuahua.” “ A bunch the length of your arm.” I picked the smallest I could find and got two steps away before I started doubting my purchase. The recipe had said nothing about <em>red</em> chard. As noted, I am nothing if not specific. I went back and located regular swiss chard.</p>

<p>Next was the gnocchi. The recipe called for “shelf-stable gnocchi,” which, according to the helpful tip, I could find in the pasta section of my grocery store. I walked up and down the pasta aisle, but there was no gnocchi to be found. I went more slowly to make sure that I wasn’t being an idiot. It didn’t help that I didn’t quite know what kind of package I was looking for. The same Shaw’s employee came back a second time to ask me if I needed help. I did, but I’m bad at asking for it. So I fled to the refrigerated section, where I knew the tortellini lived. I found a package of gnocchi, and stood for ten minutes, reading the label and contemplating. I didn’t think this was the shelf-safe gnocchi, even though it was, misleadingly, on the shelf. Did it matter? I think the point was that, in my recipe, the gnocchi was to be cooked in a pan, while the refrigerated gnocchi wanted me to boil it. Instead of making a decision like a grownup, I harrumphed my way out of the store. I’d have to go to Trader Joe’s.</p>
<p>I generally avoid specialty grocery stores, mainly because I don’t think I have the right piercing/tattoo/shoe combination to fit in, but also because I know I’ll be tempted to buy things I can’t afford. But I already had the chard and I’m unable to quit things once I’ve started them, so I put on my best hipster face and made my way over there.</p>
<p>As usual, I shouldn’t have worried. There it was, a shrink-wrapped package, labeled “Shelf-Safe Gnocchi,” a beacon of hope for all confused cooks. And it was only $1.50. I bought the multigrain kind, smiling at all the hipsters like I was one of them, and almost skipped home.</p>
<p>I chopped up what I guessed was a “small bunch” of the chard, remembering how spinach likes to shrink up in the face of heat and assuming that chard would do the same. I thought the better of this plan right away, since I didn’t want to end up with Chard and a Little Gnocchi. I divided the huge pile in half and planned to add half and gauge from there. After all, I really didn’t want to be <em>too</em> healthy. I heated up some olive oil in my nonstick skillet, and put the gnocchi in. They immediately began to stick. I took the spatula and angrily scraped the pasta bits from the pan. It was too soon to be failing already.</p>

<p>I poured the gnocchi into a separate bowl to wait while I prepared the rest of the dish, and tried one. Despite their slightly smoked flavor, the gnocchi were effing delicious. Because they’d stuck to the pan, they’d gotten slightly crispy. I considered quitting and just snacking on the gnocchi like potato chips. But I’m no quitter.</p>
<p>I added the garlic, water, the can of tomatoes, the can of beans, and the chard, and things started to go right.</p>

<p>The chard shrunk down just like I thought and I added the rest, then added the gnocchi. Cooking garlic always makes me feel professional as hell because the kitchen smelled amazing. I expected strangers on the street to come in and high five me at any moment. Lastly, I added the cheese and let it melt for a few minutes.</p>

<p>There’s going to be no more craving the cheap, delicious Olive Garden Italian when I can make this for myself. It tasted like I was eating something very, very bad for me, but there’s not nearly enough cheese to feel guilty. It’s very filling, and I’m happy to report that the chard tastes like nothing. The fact that I didn’t wash it very well added a little crunch of dirt that I’m sure just adds fiber. This is a new favorite—a way to feel a little bad while being a very good girl.</p>
