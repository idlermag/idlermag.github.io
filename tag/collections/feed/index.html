										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago our power went out. It had been happening during bad weather all winter, usually for just a few minutes. This time it lasted hours. Once it got down to 58 degrees we decided to head over to my brother-in-law’s for some heat and electricity. </p>
<p>After much fussing and crying I got the baby to sleep in their bed, which means I had thirty minutes of freedom on my hands. Yes, the baby only sleeps on his own for thirty minutes. Aren’t kids fun? I hadn’t thought to bring a book with me and my phone was in with the baby playing white noise. I was almost frantic to do something without a baby in my arms. After looking through the books in the living room and not finding anything that grabbed my attention I started snooping around in my niece’s room. She’s twenty and has a mix of young adult titles and classics. I chose <em>Ethan Frome</em> and had twenty-five blissful minutes reading about a winter much colder and snowier than ours.</p>
<p>Perusing the family books and my niece’s personal collection made me think about my collection. My collection of book is about half science fiction/fantasy. There are equal parts mystery and young adult. My only horror is Stephen King. If you were to judge me by my books you would think I’m well-read and intelligent. This is because I also own a couple dozen classics and a handful of nonfiction science books.  Working at a bookstore opened me up to owning more books than your average person. Because I was surrounded by such tempting titles I bought a lot. But, as you know from my New Year’s Resolutions, I haven’t read a lot of them.</p>
<p>I tend to buy books for a far more sophisticated and intellectual person than I really am. I have Flannery O’Connor’s <em>The Complete Stories</em>, <em>United States Essays 1952-1992</em> by Gore Vidal, <em>Catch-22</em> by Joseph Heller, and <em>DNA</em> by James Watson (of Watson and Crick). The O’Connor I bought because a coworker recommended it and I wanted to look smart; I use the Vidal book to press flowers. <em>Catch-22</em> was a book club book I never finished (aka barely started) and <em>DNA</em> makes me feel like I’m still a little bit of a scientist.</p>
<p>I buy books for the person I want to be.</p>
<p>Given a chance to read a book while my husband bought groceries with the baby, I sat down in our grocery superstore’s book section and read the first few chapters of the new Janet Evanovich book, <em>Notorious Nineteen</em>. Spoiler alert: Stephanie’s car explodes in the first few pages. Talk about lowbrow. At home I’m reading <em>Xenocide</em> by Orson Scott Card, a book I practically have memorized, part of the Ender saga. I borrowed <em>Ethan Frome</em> from my niece but I haven’t touched it since. I liked it. I find it very interesting, well written, and captivating. I have a strong feeling that I will be returning it unfinished.</p>
<p>My niece has read it. She even recommended the follow up, written by another author, about Ethan Frome’s wife, aptly titled Zeena. She has read most of the books on her shelves. They aren’t too wide in range, like mine are. They look like they all belong to the same person. Her books show where she came from, literarily, and where she is going. My books might tell where I’m going, if only I made the move to read them and actually head there.</p>
<p>All of these unread intellectual books do look very nice on my bookshelves. They grace my piano and line the mantle of our fireplace. I organize them a little by genre. Mostly how they look the prettiest. There are vases, candles, and other knick-knacks thrown in to decorate. I dust them and shift them around, but I don’t read them.</p>
<p>My husband’s books are more honest than mine, as well. He has books on brewing beer, installing car stereos, Windows servers, and whatever CCENT/CCNA ICND1 is. He had a copy of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> that he read in high school. These are his true interests. He uses the nerd books regularly and plans to brew beer this summer. While I on the other hand will probably not ever delve into the world of DNA structure analysis. </p>
<p>When I was working at the bookstore, I definitely judged customers by the books they bought. Most memorable was the woman who bought <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> and an Amish inspirational fiction book. Those did not belong in the same bag. But then again, neither do <em>The Canon</em> by Natalie Angier and <em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em>, which I have stacked on top of each other. I should probably judge people less harshly. Something about glass houses and throwing stones comes to mind. </p>
<p>Perhaps I should also judge myself less harshly. My books show that I am trying to grow as a person, as a reader. I want to read all the classics. I want to read histories and memoirs. I like to read mysteries and horror. I don’t feel like I properly enjoy short stories, which is why my coworker recommended Flannery O’Connor in the first place. Maybe it’s admirable that I’m trying to grow. Maybe I just like the look of books and the potential that they hold. My niece and my husband can have the monopoly on honest book collections. I’ll take my pretty, well organized lies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I turned 38 this year, and I’ve been thinking about life and everything that comes with age. I have also been looking up the definitions of the words malaise, ennui, bilabial fricative, and dysthymia. I’ve also been obsessed with the word albatross. “Why do you keep saying that?” my wife asks me. It would be easy, and it would fit into this and all my narratives to simply confirm that I am referring to the peaceful instrumental from the original (and truest) Fleetwood Mac. Or that I am referring to the skit from Monty Python’s <em>Live at the Hollywood Bowl</em>, which in turn nods in some form to Coleridge&#8217;s poem <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>. No, when she brings it up I launch into a rant about MY albatross, the thing around my neck that is either holding me down or holding me back. My albatross, in every definition of the word, is my record collection.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Viqr6KHwJjc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>This is not a rant about getting rid of physical records to make way for digital music. It is a straight up and simple fact that as I&#8217;ve reach my current age I feel increasingly disconnected from music in my ability to find anything new and interesting and even in my ability to enjoy what I&#8217;m listening to. I begin to question whether or not I ever did enjoy music or if it was simply a venue to pour my addictive personality traits into. Before music, it was baseball cards. Before baseball cards, it was comic books. Music has lasted the longest, for sure, but it hasn’t really been the same since I left my music store job. And when I consider that statement I realize that it actually hasn’t been the same since I achieved my own goal of running my own music department in 2001. Somewhere, the responsibility and the increasing loss of leisure time robbed a certain fundamental enjoyment of music in my life. That is a hard thing to realize. Having kids and work and such just also reduces the amount of time one has and then reduces the amount of enjoyment one can find in the music. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrqW_BZu5Xk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>And what really has this wall of sound done for me in the past 20 years of accumulation? What? Twenty years of buying music has gotten me what? Nothing. The content knowledge accumulated got me two jobs and nothing more. The knowledge collecting dust in my head has no purpose, no real world application. This is a stinging realization, even if it&#8217;s not a sudden thing, that this area of my life has resulted in a gigantic emptiness. At a point music became a commodity to me, a unit of measurement lacking any emotional center. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EpuaCaPML8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I used to be proud of my record collection. Now it is a giant black hole. Something no longer relevant to me. “Well what about playing the music for your kids?” I&#8217;ve asked myself. Why? I want my children, even now, to be independent of me. I want them to like what they like because they like it, not because I like it. A former co-worker (the one who I wrote about in <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/05/the-language-of-letting-go/">&#8220;The language of letting go&#8221;</a>) posted recently that he was listening to <em>Axis: Bold As Love</em> at age 13 and that everyone else are busters with no taste. Something charming like that. And I got to thinking: Who cares? Who cares what you listened to at 13? Who cares what you listen to at 37? Pride is a sin (if you believe in sin), and is that not a prideful statement?</p>
<p>In my first <em>Idler</em> column <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/04/234/">I wrote about Neal Pollack</a>, a writer I feel less than charitable about (even tho he is more famous than I, a better writer and probably facing less financial calamity) and his music time with his child. I recall finding the music he would play a typical, holier-than-thou hipster collection of drivel. I flashed back to this thought while looking at pictures from an in-store at Amoeba Records in Hollywood. Smack dab in the middle of the photos one literally burned my eyes and into my brain. There was this shaggy guy in a checkered shirt, looking to be in his mid 20s. Black hair, shaggy beard. Holding in his arms a CHILD. What was the in-store? Jomo Podmore and Irmin Schmidt. I realized I reached a new point in the circle of hipster garbage. Like Miles Davis I started at zero and have reached zero again. Only the zero is me. </p>
<p>All I know is I can’t even stand to look at my CD collection right now. I used to think it was bad when both racks were in the master bedroom in my house. Then I would wake up and see it and hate it and wish it was gone but never could bring myself to do anything about it. Then I noticed that the light from yonder window was bleaching the color from my beloved little investments and so I moved both racks across the house. And now I see the entirety of my life spread out on one wall. Not only that, but my bookshelves are in that same room, four IKEA bookshelves of wasted money and unread texts. I&#8217;ve spent too much time thinking about these items, too much money purchasing them. Just too much.</p>
<p>Our slogan at this site is &#8220;Refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy.&#8221; I fully support that slogan and the idea behind it. But neither can I apologize for what I do not enjoy and I no longer enjoy music. Hate might be a strong word but I sure am over it right now. And that void, that abyss, is scary. </p>
<p>Maybe this will change, maybe it won’t. Maybe I will be back. Maybe this is it. In the event of my non-return let me thank the editor and founder of the site who asked me out of the blue if I wanted to write about music. Thanks man. (QUITTER!-ed.) And finally thanks to you, the readers. I thank both of you for reading these bemused and reflective ramblings of a man slowly wondering about life itself. I’m going to sign off with the last song I played on WNMC in 2009. I’ve been back on-air since, but not in a regular capacity. It seems fitting now.</p>
