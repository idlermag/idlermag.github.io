										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While summer reading lists tend to put one in mind of trashy paperbacks stashed away in canvas bags for beach reading, not many of us will spend the entire summer in a folding chair. Thus, a good set of summer reading suggestions will include options suitable for a variety of situations and pursuits. Whether you&#8217;re soaking up summer rays, trapped inside by a sudden summer storm, or looking for a different kind of summer getaway, this list should have you covered. (You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>
<p><strong>For those hot summer days:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10109" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/heat/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg" data-orig-size="271,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="heat" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=203" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=271" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&#038;h=150" alt="Heat" title="heat" width="101" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10109" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=202&amp;h=298 202w" sizes="(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px" /> Other than <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/18/quit-cooking-start-reading/">Jill&#8217;s Kolongowski&#8217;s recommendation</a> of Julia Child&#8217;s <em>My Life in Paris</em> (which is both an amazing book and actually about a lot more than just Child&#8217;s life in Paris), the most enjoyable food book you can add to your summer reading list is Bill Buford&#8217;s <em><strong>Heat: An Amateur&#8217;s Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany</strong></em>. Formerly Fiction Editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>, Buford leaves his magazine job to learn about cooking in Mario Batali&#8217;s restaurant Babbo shortly before the release of <em>The Babbo Cookbook</em>. It&#8217;s a time when the restaurant is both preparing for fresh critical scrutiny and tweaking the menu to move beyond the soon-to-be-published set of recipes. No one in the kitchen has the time or patience for a rank amateur in their midst, and Buford has to make the most of it &#8212; which he does with humor, humility, and aplomb. <em>Heat</em> is a welcome counterpoint for those of us put off a bit by the overwhelming bravado of Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s <em>Kitchen Confidential</em>, and things just get better when Buford heads off to Italy to study with some of Batali&#8217;s mentors.</p>
<p><strong>For those stormy summer nights:</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s actually some really amazing stuff in even the biggest mainstream comic books right now. Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo&#8217;s work on <em>Batman</em> is unbelievable (and in a different venue, I&#8217;d have written that word in all-caps AND bold AND italics), Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang&#8217;s work on <em>Wonder Woman</em> is everything the New 52 promised to do, a magnificent re-imagining of a classic (but too-often underutilized) character &#8212; the character designs alone are worth cover price &#8212; and Gail Simone&#8217;s <em>Batgirl</em> is a remarkable and psychologically gripping take on Barbara Gordon that manages to preserve most of what was wonderful about Simone&#8217;s time writing the character as Oracle. (This is high praise coming from me. I was really disappointed that <a href="http://gavinjcraig.com/2011/08/21/goodbye-batgirl-hello-batgirl/" target="_blank">DC was abandoning</a> <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2009/08/quick-break.html" target="_blank">Stephanie Brown</a> in order to bring back the Barbara Gordon Batgirl, although, in fairness, I might just be the only person in the world who feels that way.)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10116" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/batman-and-son/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg" data-orig-size="419,644" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Batman-and-Son" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=195" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=419" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&#038;h=150" alt="Batman and Son" title="Batman-and-Son" width="97" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10116" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&amp;h=150 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=194&amp;h=298 194w" sizes="(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px" /> But, assuming that you might not be the sort of person who visits a comic shop every month, let me recommend Grant Morrison&#8217;s current run on <em>Batman, Inc.</em> as the culmination of a story he&#8217;s been telling since 2006. Morrison is a writer whose work actually often reads better when it&#8217;s been collected into a trade volume where the reader can pick up all the visual and story clues he weaves together from month to month (which can often seem a bit obscure when you&#8217;re only getting 20ish pages at a time, with 30 or more days between installments). Morrison&#8217;s saga starts with <em><strong>Batman and Son</strong></em> (with a jaw-dropping first issue where Batman fights ninja man-bats in a Roy-Lichtenstein-inspired pop art exhibition), and continues in <em><strong>The Black Glove</strong></em> (with art by the no-less-than-absolutely-brilliant J. H. Williams III), <strong>Batman R.I.P.</strong>, <em><strong>Batman &amp; Robin Vol. 1: Batman Reborn</strong></em> (where Dick Grayson steps into the cape and cowl), <em><strong>Vol. 2: Batman vs. Robin</strong></em>, <em><strong>Vol. 3: Batman &amp; Robin Must Die</strong></em>, and finally, the pre-New 52 <strong><em>Batman, Incorporated</em></strong>. (Completists will include <em>Final Crisis</em> and <em>The Return of Bruce Wayne</em>, but you can get away without reading those two. Just know that Bruce Wayne dies, sort of, and then comes back.)</p>
<p>Like many &#8220;difficult&#8221; writers, the trick to reading Morrison is to just keep going. With Morrison in particular, you&#8217;ll get totally lost if you worry about making sense of everything. I think the big secret is that Morrison spends a lot less time worrying about whether he makes sense than building and keeping up a sort of narrative cadence and momentum. When you really get into him, you don&#8217;t so much read as excavate, digging up all the things that you didn&#8217;t realize were there at first, and finding yourself pulled into the most neglected and maligned corners of a character&#8217;s history, suddenly shown (well, skillfully retconned) to have been the most interesting and important thing all along.</p>
<p>But, having said that, you don&#8217;t need to know anything about Grant Morrison or even Batman to pick up <em>Batman and Son</em>. (Although, good luck putting it down once you&#8217;ve started.)</p>
<p><strong>For getting away from it all:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10122" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/journeycollectorsed/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg" data-orig-size="277,350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="journeycollectorsed" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=237" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=277" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=118&#038;h=150" alt="Journey Collector&#039;s Edition" title="journeycollectorsed" width="118" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10122" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=118&amp;h=150 118w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=236&amp;h=298 236w" sizes="(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px" /> Being the sort of person who tends to talk about narrative video games, I&#8217;m going to recommend a game rather than a book on games. (If you&#8217;re looking for a fun AND smart book on video games, there&#8217;s always Tom Bissell&#8217;s <strong><em>Extra Lives</em></strong>, which <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2010/06/diary-of-casual-gamer-2-confessions-and.html" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>, or you can do what I do and crib from <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/" target="_blank">The Brainy Gamer</a>&#8216;s bookshelf.)</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t played it yet, go download Thatgamecompany&#8217;s <em><strong><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/18/three-meditations-on-journey/">Journey</a></strong></em> right now. There&#8217;s a collector&#8217;s edition disc coming out at the end of August (which will also include <em>Flower</em> and <em>Flow</em>), but don&#8217;t wait. Hell, download it now AND buy the disc in August. Anything to encourage people to make more games like this.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, <em>Journey</em> will only be available for the Playstation 3, so my apologies if you don&#8217;t own one. For everyone else, we can count <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect-3/Extended_Cut_Endings">the new <em>Mass Effect 3</em> endings</a> as narrative, right? Just for the summer?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that scientists recently calculated how much we actually read in our work and personal lives? It seems a typical person today consumes the equivalent of 174 full newspapers a day in information &#8212; nearly <em>five times</em> as much as 25 years ago. Between email, print material, internet browsing, and advertising, we are literally inundated with text from wake to sleep. Frankly, it’s a miracle that anyone can read for pleasure anymore. Who has the time?</p>
<p>Add to this little factoid the reality of being a comic book collector. One of the things I love most about comic books is that, barring some sort of natural disaster, they show up every Wednesday at your local shop. Every week there’s a new crop of books, and I can’t remember the last time I didn’t have at least one waiting for me. Keeping up isn’t always a chore, but it certainly can become one. God forbid you fall a week behind, because that story you haven’t found the time to read yet is about to get spoiled the second you turn on your computer. Twitter becomes a minefield more stressful than jumping around Gotham City wearing a yellow cape, bright red tunic and little green booties.</p>
<p>So with all this energy I’m putting into reading my weekly comic books, email, research for work, internet browsing, and being sold a new cable provider for the 95th time in a day (in order of obvious importance), what about everything else I want to read? Well, it’s quickly become a stack on my dresser, sitting patiently next to my keys and any number of adorable trinkets that don’t have a permanent home. Most of these books are in some state of consumption, half read and then put down &#8212; not because they aren’t amazing, but because life unfortunately gets in the way.</p>
<p>Well, life is just going to have to take a backseat for the next few months, because I now vow publicly to upend this stack by the time the first orange leaf hits the sidewalk this fall. Want a summer full of awesomeness, too? Read along!</p>
<p><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="10014" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/21/my-summer-stack-of-comics/alpha-cover-2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg" data-orig-size="250,380" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Alpha-cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg?w=197" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg?w=250" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg?w=197&#038;h=300" alt="Alpha" title="Alpha-cover" width="197" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10014" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg?w=197&amp;h=300 197w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/alpha-cover1.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px" /></a> <strong><em>Alpha</em> by Greg Rucka</strong><br />
Described by the author as “Die Hard in Disneyland,” <em>Alpha</em> is the first book in a new series for Rucka, who not only wrote <em>Gotham Central</em> and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/06/super-heroines-stains-and-all/">Batwoman&#8217;s run in <em>Detective Comics</em></a>, but also my favorite novel series of all-time starring Atticus Kodiak (<em>Keeper</em>, <em>Finder</em>, <em>Smoker</em>, etc.). Undercover Delta Force operator, Master Sergeant Jad Bell has been assigned to the Wilsonville amusement park as an undercover security officer. The action begins with the detection of a hidden dirty bomb and escalates from there. No one writes an action hero’s inner monologue better than Rucka, so this one tops my list.</p>
<p><strong><em>Avengers West Coast</em> and <em>Alpha Flight Classic</em> by John Byrne</strong><br />
Each of these books are over 20 years old at this point, but still have ramifications for Marvel Comics to this day. Both volumes of <em>Avengers West Coast</em> that Byrne wrote and drew (<em>Vision Quest</em> and <em>Darker Than Scarlet</em>) focus heavily on the Scarlet Witch and her synthezoid husband The Vision. In fact, the former’s path to madness begins in these stories and carries through to this summer’s blockbuster comic crossover. Likewise, the first two volumes of <em>Alpha Flight Classic</em> introduce the first and best Canadian super-team in their own series, with the ever-acerbic Northstar front and center. Northstar is currently set to marry his longtime boyfriend in this month’s <em>Astonishing X-Men</em>, so it’s nice to see where it all began for this preeminent gay super-hero.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10016" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/21/my-summer-stack-of-comics/firearm/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/firearm.jpg" data-orig-size="250,378" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Firearm" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/firearm.jpg?w=198" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/firearm.jpg?w=250" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/firearm.jpg?w=198&#038;h=300" alt="Firearm" title="Firearm" width="198" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10016" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/firearm.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300 198w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/firearm.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/firearm.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /> <strong><em>Firearm</em> by James Robinson and Cully Hamner</strong><br />
This one came out of the way-back machine after I listened to an interview with the owners of now-defunct Malibu Comics &#8212; a thriving comic book publisher in the early 1990s who spun off their own super-hero universe, the Ultraverse. The series centers on private investigator Alec Swan, who gets dragged into cases involving the strange and ultra-human, much to his chagrin. Lasting only 18 issues, <em>Firearm</em> was one of James Robinson’s earliest ongoing series and if <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/26/recreating-the-golden-age/"><em>Starman</em></a> and the recently released <em>Earth 2</em> are any indication, I’m going to love this one too.</p>
<p><em><strong>Chicks Dig Comics</strong></em><br />
A collection of essays about comics by and for the women who love them, Chicks Dig Comics features a litany of writers that I have grown fond of year after year &#8212; Gail Simone, Amanda Conner, Jill Pantozzi, Jen Van Meter, Jill Thompson, and many more. Published this spring by Mad Norwegian Press, this is the book to read if you know (or are) someone who thinks comics are just for the boys. The commentaries are simultaneously thought provoking, entertaining, and certainly a source of aspiration for my own writing on comics.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Quality Companion</em></strong><br />
Published by TwoMorrows, one of the comic industry’s most prestigious sources for historical analysis, <em>The Quality Companion</em> is a look at the now largely forgotten comic company that debuted Plastic Man and the Spirit, among other 1940s luminaries. Quality was later purchased by DC Comics and had its characters absorbed &#8212; in one form or another &#8212; into the main DC Universe where I would encounter them years later. Some of these characters are once again being reintroduced in a big way with sexy good girl <em>Phantom Lady</em> striking out in her own mini-series this summer, co-starring the diminutive Doll Man. Everything from bios on the original creators to synopses of the heroes’ books themselves are well documented here both for posterity and your enjoyment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Finn and Charlie are Hitched</em> by Tony Breed</strong><br />
A weekly webcomic by writer/artist Tony Breed, <em>Finn and Charlie</em> is a cute little slice of life for two men who are married and approaching middle age. Although I can read it anytime at <a href="http://hitchedcomic.com" target="_blank">hitchedcomic.com</a>, I do like to double dip and pick up the collections. The first two, <em>Can We Skip to the Part of the Conversation Where I Get My Way?</em> (a phrase I have thought in my head many times while talking to my husband) and <em>I Love You, You Big Weirdo</em> (which I say some form of every night before bed) are now joined by <em>How Would I Know If You’re Dreaming?</em> The new book also features a delightfully naked Finn on its cover with a well-placed penguin to maintain the character’s modesty. Drat!</p>
<p><strong><em>Supergods</em> by Grant Morrison</strong><br />
Last on my list is a book that’s one part history, one part autobiography, and about three parts diary of a big comic book geek (who just happens to be a little off his rocker). Grant Morrison has written some of my favorite titles over the years and the chance to peek into his brain is too good to pass up. Subtitled <em>What Masked Vigilantes, Miraculous Mutants, and a Sun God from Smallville Can Teach Us About Being Human</em>, <em>Supergods</em> is a wild ride through the legacy of super-hero comics that makes it crystal clear these characters are truly our modern myths. Agree or disagree with his observations about Superman, Batman or the like, but you know this is going to be a fascinating read one way or the other.</p>
<p>Now, how much vacation time do I have saved up?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Matt Santori-Griffith</strong> owns one business suit, three pairs of shoes, and over 15,000 comic books. He works a day job as an art director for several non-profit organizations, but spends his dark nights and weekends fighting the good fight on Twitter.com in the guise of <a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/#!/FotoCub">@FotoCub</a>. He has not yet saved the world, but isn’t giving up quite yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as a nonfiction writer, I’ve already managed to lie to you before I even start. Quit cooking, start reading is not quite true &#8212; I pretty much never stop reading. Not to eat, brush my teeth, not even when cleaning the kitchen or taking a walk. I read my way through the winter hibernation and through the summer vacations. Whenever I fly, I carry 2-3 books on the plane with me because I’m too cheap for an e-reader and because I’m likely to get through at least two. The back problems are totally worth it.</p>
<p>One of my professors sent me the reading list for my fall literature class ahead of time so that we can go ahead and get started. A cooler person than me might have been dismayed, but it made me thrilled to start school. Partly, I was psyched because I’d already read some of the things on the list, which made me feel educated as hell. And that meant I could reread them, actually remember them, and maybe think of some smart shit to say ahead of time in class. (But not too many smart things &#8212; no one wants to be THAT girl, and I don’t want to be shunned at the after-class happy hour.) I’ve already started rereading Nabokov’s <em>Lolita</em>, and have been keeping a list of the beautiful and inventive language he uses so that I can try to learn something while I limp along in my novicehood.</p>
<p>For example: “. . . a poplar playing its liquid shadows all over the local Honor Roll” (p. 137); the backyard with “apple-green light” (p. 31); Lolita with “all four limbs starfished” across the chair (p. 174). Oh dear, I got too Englishy. But if you can’t appreciate the gorgeous prose, then I probably can’t appreciate you. I’m also excited to reread Raymond Carver’s short stories “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” and “Beginners.”</p>
<p>I expect to probably be cooking much less when I’m in school, and writing to you about the best ways to jazz up rice and beans, writing a treatise on the various forms of caffeine, or on the best way to discreetly drink wine during workshop. But before I do all of that, I’m headed back to Michigan with my dad’s side of the family and Charlie to go up north to one of my most favorite places.</p>

<p>We all spend a ton of time reading up there, moving from the hammock to the dock, to the pontoon, to a lawn chair, and back to the hammock again. My dad reads exactly one book a year. He always reads it up north, and it’s always about music. Last year I let him borrow my copy of Steve Almond’s book <em>Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life</em>, with its companion playlist. The year before that, he read Keith Richards’s <em>Life</em>, and read aloud anecdotes about prostitutes and drug cocktails. The year before that, it was Alice Cooper’s book <em>Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roller&#8217;s 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict</em> (which is actually pretty hilarious).</p>
<p>For me, I found a used book at the lovely <a href="http://www.greenapplebooks.com/" target="_blank">Green Apple Books</a> called <em>Not for Bread Alone: Writers on Food, Wine, and the Art of Eating</em>, edited by Daniel Halpern. It’s a collection of food writing from well-known writers, including Wendell Berry, Charles Simic, Joyce Carol Oates, and Francine Prose, among others. Before I get started with classes and get buried under class readings, I’m bringing that one up north, along with Julia Child’s <em>My Life in France</em>, which was given to me as a gift and I MUST READ before I lose all steam.</p>
<p>Reading while lying in the sun and/or eating is one of the things I enjoy most. I wish you all a happy summer, and happy reading!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t know grief until you experience grief.  Its pain is ineffable. It socks your body and mind and ruins all sense of reason, meaning. Anything you’ve believed or held true becomes subject to question when someone you care for passes away because something impossibly ridiculous has happened &#8212; a living breathing someone gives up the spark of life and enters a world of objects. Voice, heart, soul, mind, touch. . . all removed from personhood.  Unmagicked into a thing, a someone becomes corpse, becomes ash, becomes not. As death and grief are universals that rip at the fabric of human understanding, of course this subject matter has inspired much in the way of the arts. Though I’ve been moved by many a film and story, I reserve this space to discuss a text that maybe you won’t happen upon on the bestsellers case at your bookstore, or hear about from a friend. Anne Carson’s book/assemblage <em>Nox</em> (2010) has affected me deeply as it so closely and strangely performs and researches the reaches of grief through its remarkable structure, art, truth and tone.  This odd text is worth seeking, finding, discovering and revisiting again and again.</p>
<p>Carson lost her brother twice. A kind of shade in life, he lived apart from his family. Estranged for long periods of time, he kept little contact with his sister. He’d pass along snippets of information by post &#8212; his envelopes acting as clues to his whereabouts overseas. He was a brother, blood, but he existed and didn’t.  His death gave his absence a new permanence and the author was left with the odd practice of learning to grieve for a shade &#8212; giving up he who was already a ghost.  <em>Nox</em> could be interpreted as her attempt of reconfiguring him, erecting a monument, seeking her brother, seeking peace. In making her piece, Carson creates a solid, material presence in the face of loss. It commemorates, elegizes, and yearns for him. Both heartrending and comforting, the text exposes her wounds, but also creates a space for commiseration through the making-public, the opening out of her pain to a world of others floating in the same limbo of emotions.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9953" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/06/unpacking-loss-unpacking-nox/nox1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg" data-orig-size="610,406" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Nox1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=610" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=640" alt="Nox" title="Nox1"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9953" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg 610w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>Paradoxically apt then, <em>Nox</em> is a book that is not one.  A grey hardcover case, something like a pencil or cigar box, houses one long folded sheet, an accordion of pictures, pasted-in letters, hand-scribbled and typewritten text. This unexpected book-form embodies a different kind of connectivity between the reader and what is written. With its layered folds the construction of the accordion suggests a different relationship between story and its experienced temporality. Before we’ve even read the first line, Carson forces us to sensually read and feel the text, to understand with fingers and eyes &#8212; we read without words.  We must open the box, find its secret. Lift the heft of the zigzagging page, careful not to spill it.  We do not merely start reading, but are offered an encounter. Photocopied pages from books and articles, well-worn and folded notes, dog-eared photographs and the visual echoes of writing (a pencil pressed into a page too hard) all lend themselves to the creation of authenticity, the personal, while also expressing the lack that inevitably surrounds these traces—these things only lead back, but do not (re)capture.</p>
<p>An academic and poet, Carson leans on poetry, history, and etymology to answer her questions and fill grief’s emptiness.  Her questions range from the intimately personal (Who was my brother? To me?) to the generalizable or philosophical (How have people written of loss historically? How do the words and practices of the past shape who we are? How we grieve and how we feel?).  She covers the gamut examining historical texts from the ancient Greeks to historical texts from her family’s archive.  Placing these works side by side suggests their similarity as practices of collection, keeping, and knowing, that ultimately cannot offer <em>enough</em> truth or consolation in the face of a death’s void.  Carson records her brother’s life (or more his death?) like a history or legend.  She makes it akin to her precious academic artifacts perhaps hoping to rub more epic meaning on the ordinariness of her loss. Or, perhaps in this move, she stresses the power of context &#8212; the intimate experiences of “my life” are felt as mythic in proportion. She then invites us into this scrapbook of her personal tragedy &#8212; asks us to place it beside Oedipus and Antigone, Romeo, Hamlet.</p>
<p>Carson reminds us that our lives &#8212; even as we live them daily, solidly, in what we deem “reality” &#8212; are made up of things that are only close to us, or pretend to be us. We compose ourselves through the stories we remember, the stories we choose to tell and not tell, archives we endorse or simply leave behind.  Carson tries to re-member her brother through or as an object &#8212; the writing, the book.  He is brought together in pieces like Osiris, reformed, but the product is never satisfactory. Always product, never brother. A collection of scraps and fragments, this text, and perhaps all our histories, form poetic statements that yearn for context, detail and connection, but they also stand alone as particularly resonant poetic moments of open-endedness &#8212; fragments that can only create the feelings/meanings they create because of their inherent disconnection.</p>
<p>I can’t say that writing/building/making this text was a salve of some kind to its maker. I don’t know if it brought relief or consolation or even if consolation is at all ever possible. I can say however that the reading and experiencing of Carson’s <em>Nox</em> is the closest thing I’ve found to someone saying “I know how you feel. I’ve been there. I am there,” while also being the closest I’ve felt to actually believing that statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was growing up, my dad spoke fondly about the time in his life when he reread his favorite book, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, once a year. “On an exceptionally hot evening in July,” he would quote in a funny voice, imitating a friend who didn&#8217;t get his love for the book, “a young man came out of his garret on S Place and walked slowly toward K Bridge&#8211;what is this stuff?” But during the 1970s, he made a point of reading the book every year.</p>

It&#8217;s <em>Little, Big</em>, by John Crowley, a sprawling fantasy family saga. Sometime during the summer, some hot and languorous week, I have a strong sense that it&#8217;s time. I drop the five other books I&#8217;m in the middle of, find a place to read and a bowl of apples, and return to the story. I haven&#8217;t memorized the first line like my dad did with his book, but <em>Little, Big</em> starts with Smoky Barnable walking from the City to the house called Edgewood to get married. Alice (called Daily Alice) Drinkwater is waiting. She takes a bath in Edgewood&#8217;s Gothic Bathroom, with stained glass and a stone tub (this is an indelible image for me). And the story goes inward and outward.</p>
<p><em>Little, Big</em> is subtitled, in the style of Victorian novels, <em>The Fairies&#8217; Parliament, </em>and it is indeed an exploration of the sympathetic magic between world and person, Word and utterance, wood and bird. The family story of the Drinkwaters is implicated in a magico-political rebuilding of America. A heartbroken young man builds a memory palace. Alice&#8217;s great-uncle photographs fairies in the bottom of the garden. Edgewood&#8217;s rusty orrery grinds back to orbit. The title reminds you to be attentive to the echoes of “as above, so below” throughout Smoky and Alice&#8217;s family story.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised, really, that I can&#8217;t recite the first line, because while the book&#8217;s language is beautiful, lyrical, and deliberate, I experience it after so many rereads as a sequence of dream images. When I reread <em>Little, Big</em> I fall back into them. I read for the images I can&#8217;t forget &#8212; and for unremembered images so vivid I&#8217;m amazed I could forget them. Every time I reread I&#8217;m struck by an incident involving a changeling that I find so terrifying that I block it out, just like the characters do. The structure is cyclical, too, so that I know that the story will turn back, like the paths in the private walled garden in the novel. I haven&#8217;t reread <em>Little, Big </em>yet this summer, but soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a certain day in June, 19&#8211;, a young man was making his way on foot northward from the great City to a town or place called Edgewood, that he had been told of but had never visited. His name was Smoky Barnable, and he was going to Edgewood to get married; the fact that he walked but did not ride was one of the conditions placed on his coming there at all.</p></blockquote>
