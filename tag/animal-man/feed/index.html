										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession to make; I don’t understand some of Grant Morrison’s stories. What I mean to say is that I usually can follow the plot and generally comprehend the basic narrative but I feel like I’m missing important things within the tales. It seems as if I am only reading the surface and there is so much more below. My geek resume is strong &#8212; I read my first comic book when I was ten years old and I think I have a fairly decent comprehension of the how comic book stories generally work. I understand panel layouts, reoccurring themes and ideas, and have a working knowledge of comic book continuity and history. In other words, I’m a fanboy (albeit a middle-aged one). This means that I&#8217;m generally able to relatively easily process and understand the comic books I read each week. Frankly, many of them are reheating older ideas that I have encountered at least once and probably several times before. Superman loses his powers and has to prove it’s not only his super-abilities that make him a hero. (I’ve read it before.) Spider-Man has to protect the very society that fears and persecutes him. (I’ve seen it many times.) A comic book publisher creates a company-wide crossover that promises to change everything; I’ve invested more money than I can count into these tales and have the issues of <i>Invasion</i>, <i>Zero Hour</i>, and <i>House of M</i> to prove it.</p>
<p>Since I believe I know most, if not all, of the comic book tropes, it bothers me when I find something that I can’t completely wrap my head around. Some of Grant Morrison’s stories do this to me. <i>The Invisibles</i> &#8212; I’m still trying to grasp many of the stories’ imbedded concepts. <i>Arkham Asylum</i> &#8212; I think I understand it but then I wonder if I’m missing something. <i>Final Crisis</i> &#8212; don’t even get me started on this one. This confounds me because <i>All-Star Superman</i> and Morrison’s <i>Doom Patrol</i> are two of my favorite comic book runs ever. It irritates me that I can’t completely follow all of Morrison’s storytelling, especially since I agree with him that narrative is a powerful force that is widely underappreciated.</p>

<p>The other reason that I would like to better follow all of Morrison’s references and motivations is he wrote a comic book story that to this day still deeply resonates with me. It’s <i>Animal Man</i> #5, “The Coyote Gospel,&#8221; a heartbreaking tale of heroism and loss, the like of which rarely finds its way into superhero comics. The story features a Wile E. Coyote stand-in named Crafty (get it?) who serves as the story’s messianic figure. If you start with the elevator pitch of “Wile E. Coyote is Christ” you’ve already got a bizarre and amazing idea but Morrison adds heroism and sorrow to the mix. He somehow makes the reader care about the coyote savior while at the same time making us question ourselves and the world around us. A pretty mean feat for a “funny book” about a guy who received animal powers from aliens.</p>
<p>In “The Coyote Gospel,” Crafty comes from a Warner Brothers-like cartoon world where life is poor, nasty, brutish, and long. The land’s animated denizens are continually battling each other with Acme-type weapons and cartoonish methods. This causes only pain and strife though none of the cartoons question their lives. One day Crafty rebels against this system of violence and appears before his god. Appropriately, Crafty’s god is the artist who created him and presumably writes and draws the coyote’s adventures. The creator sends Crafty into the comic book version of the reader’s world and declares that the cartoon coyote has been sentenced to Hell. As long as Crafty suffers in this other existence the creator promises to allow peace to flourish in the cartoon world. Crafty is given a new body and suffers pain and humiliation again and again but he seemingly cannot die. The former cartoon coyote agonizes so his people (read animals) will not. He bears his world’s pain and sacrifices himself in order to fight misery and injustice. In the end, a conservative Christian, who believes that he is slaying the devil, kills Crafty. The coyote cries as he holds a crucifixion pose and dies in the middle of a four-way intersection, which looks suspiciously like a cross. The story ends with a giant hand using a huge paintbrush to fill in the artistic details. The artist god has killed Crafty and the pact that kept the animal’s world safe is now broken.</p>

<p>I read this story about once a year and it always manages to touch me and force me to ponder life, death, selflessness, and the nature of God. Not bad for a comic book tale featuring a Wile E. Coyote look-alike and a yellow and orange clad superhero. Maybe I want too much but I wonder if more of Morrison’s stories could touch me this way if I better understood them. <i>All-Star Superman </i>did. I reveled in connecting the dots between <i>DC One Million </i>and the twelve issue series. I loved the numerous winks to Silver Age stories and issue number six broke my heart. This makes me ponder if I should work harder to understand Morrison’s writing and do the necessary research to better connect with the author. Something about that idea leaves me cold though. If I have to studying in order to understanding Morrison’s work, will the benefit be the same? Will I feel it as deeply as I do with <i>Animal Man</i> #5? Maybe sometimes our histories and interests coincide with an author’s imagination and we cannot force this connection. Perhaps, it is something unique when a writer and a reader share a narrative bond and these moments should be treasured for their rarity. I probably will never completely understand Grant Morrison’s stories but maybe that’s a good thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d like to clear up a bit of a myth &#8212; you can actually follow either <em>Animal Man</em> or <em>Swamp Thing</em> without reading the other. Writers Jeff Lemire and Scott Snyder have clearly spent the first year of the two titles building a common world with a number of common elements and themes, but they each have their own plan. Together, the two titles considered together form a dark, rich tapestry, but they&#8217;re each outstanding titles on their own. You don&#8217;t have to read both <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em>, although I can&#8217;t imagine why you wouldn&#8217;t want to.</p>

<p>At first glance, Buddy Baker and Alec Holland don&#8217;t have much in common. Baker is a sometime actor and stuntman who has embraced his public role as Animal Man not just to fight crime, but to be an advocate for animal issues. He&#8217;s married with a son and a daughter, and while his acting career has never really taken off, he&#8217;s just starred in a little indie film which is garnering a some attention and even a hint of Oscar buzz. In the pages of <em>Animal Man</em>, there&#8217;s an ongoing contrast between the humble, salt-of-the-earth (I&#8217;m trying to avoid the phrase white trash) nature of the Baker family, and the way modern media occasionally intrudes on the story &#8212; the first page of the first issue of <em>Animal Man</em> is a faux interview with Buddy Baker from the deeply hip magazine <em>The Believer</em>, and most of the sixth issue consists of scenes from Baker&#8217;s indie film <em>Tights</em>, as viewed on Baker&#8217;s son&#8217;s smartphone while the family is on the run in their RV.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10625" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/28/521-the-varieties-of-horror/hollandconstruction/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg" data-orig-size="640,394" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hollandconstruction" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=640&#038;h=394" alt="Alec Holland, contractor" title="hollandconstruction" width="640" height="394" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10625" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=300&amp;h=185 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Alec Holland, on the other hand, is a renowned plant biologist who in the first issue of <em>Swamp Thing</em> is working in construction. He&#8217;s recently returned to life after a lab explosion years ago to find not only that his wife wasn&#8217;t so lucky, but that he shares memories with a monstrous superhero animated by a force known as the Parliament of Trees using what they were able to salvage of Holland&#8217;s personality after his death. The Parliament now wants Holland to become their champion himself as they had always intended, and he feels the unwanted pull of that destiny in both his waking hours and in his dreams.</p>
<p>But for all their differences, Baker and Holland have one thing in common. Their lives have been shaped and directed by forces that are beyond anything they had ever imagined, and the first year of each of their titles can be read as an extended cinematic pull back shot. In every issue, the frame expands a little, revealing a world bigger, deeper, stranger, and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In the New 52, Animal Man and Swamp Thing are revealed to be champions (&#8220;avatars&#8221;) for the constantly battling forces of animal and plant life, known as The Red and The Green, both of which oppose the embodied force of death known as The Rot. In times of balance, each of the three forces keeps the others in check. If things were in balance, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have much of a story, and both titles at the inception find themselves in a place where the way things are is far from the way things should be.</p>
<p>In <em>Animal Man</em>, artist Travel Foreman evokes this dislocation by creating a world of open, realistic but flattened spaces with bizarre, hyper-detailed intruders. (Steve Pugh largely takes over by issue #7, but maintains Foreman&#8217;s overall stylistic deisgn.) Buddy Baker and his family are pursued by a grotesque, distended group calling themselves The Hunters Three who can consume living beings and wear their skins. The Hunters are portrayed as occasionally struggling to fit within their assumed shapes, which become cartoonishly distorted when a hunter is distracted or fatigued. Nothing about the process is pleasant or pretty. &#8220;This will hurt very badly,&#8221; one of the hunters tells a victim as he is being eaten, &#8220;but I need your sssskin. . .&#8221;</p>

<p>The flatness of Buddy Baker&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; world is a vivid illustration of the new series&#8217; central revelation. While Baker has been empowered by the Red as the <em>de facto</em> champion of the animal world, he is only a placeholder. The untimely death of the Red&#8217;s previous avatar left them in need of a temporary replacement, so they granted some of the next avatar&#8217;s abilities to her father. Maxine Baker&#8217;s connection to the Red far exceeds anything Buddy Baker has ever experienced, and her nacent powers already far exceed his own. Maxine is also just four years old, and for all her power, far from able to protect herself from the Lovecraftian figures pursing her.</p>
<p>While Buddy Baker finds himself a smaller figure in a bigger world, a custodian more than a champion, then Alec Holland is precisely the opposite, the champion who was taken from the Green and has now returned. Holland, however, wants nothing to do with the destiny the Green so fervently desires that he embrace, and he finds himself trying to prune back the tendrils the Parliament of Trees have wrapped around his soul. Fittingly, Yanick Paquette&#8217;s art is lush, flowing, and sometimes oppressively detailed. In the second and third issues, Holland meets a kindred spirit in Abigail Arcane, a woman whose family has a deep connection to the Rot, and who has a history with the Alec Holland simulacrum that was the previous Swamp Thing. Holland finds himself irresistibly drawn to Abigail, defending her life against both the Rot seeking to reclaim her, and the Green&#8217;s demands that he destroy her. </p>

<p>In different hands, we might have had two strong but unrelated titles, the interim hero and the reluctant champion with their very different stories in their own separate worlds. Linking the two together is a brilliant idea which has been executed with what I&#8217;m certain was no little effort and a great deal of skill. The star-crossed lovers and the father defending his progeny are both classic, even primal stories, but together they form a rich and unexpected epic about blood and family, and creating a future beyond what is encoded within history and genetics.</p>
<p>Because of this, <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em> are comics about heroism and not just superheroes. Both titles have seen, groundbreaking work in the past (as written by Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, respectively), but they existed for all practical purposes in their own pocket narrative universes. With their New 52 incarnations, Snyder and Lemire have been able to bring themes (and a level of quality) more often found in indie comics or imprints like Vertigo to the mainstream DC universe. It&#8217;s an effort whose first fruits are just beginning to mature, but the ground is rich, and there&#8217;s the promise of even better to come.</p>
