										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. Post fewer pictures of my dogs online or post less about my life in general.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe not everyone thinks it’s hilarious when my wiener dog is sleep-farting on the couch.  Dachshunds in various states of repose and/or sporting the latest in blanket burrito fashion may only be of interest to other grad school shut-ins.  Not everyone’s a crazy dog lady—I get it.  But people must at least care about the jerkholes I run into at Starbucks on a daily basis. . . right?!  No.  In fact, since I go to the jerkhole Starbucks I should probably assume that I, too, am one of the jerks in this jerkstore.</p>
<p>Wait, is that a photo of your newborn baby covered in birthing goo bungee jumping out of your wife’s womb sullying my Facebook feed? Yeah. Forget everything I was just resolving.</p>
<p><strong>2. Speaking of feeds, I vow to be less jealous of those people who post about the amazing seven course dinners (juicy photos included) that they “just threw together” while doing a load of laundry, ironing out a pesky chapter in their latest novel, and de-lousing the friendly neighbor child they babysit (free of charge) in the afternoons.</strong></p>
<p>No, I will not be jealous as I eat canned bean surprise (straight from the can &#8212; that’s the surprise!) in my yoga pants that have yet to see the pure and healing stretchy joys of yoga.  Om to you my friends.  Eat heartily!  Think not of me in my bean-stained yoga pants yelling sage advice to Snooki on the TV.  We’re cool.  I swear.</p>
<p><strong>3. This year I will not watch <em>Jersey Shore</em> or any permutation of <em>The Kardashians</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Not even <em>Kim and Khloe: Two Hos in Hoboken</em>?  No, I will be strong.  What if J-Woww brings her cute dogs back to the shore? No.  I have my own dogs to look at.  What if Kourtney goes all weird Mama Zen again and delivers the next kid just like she pulled out Mason?  Well, I already established that I don’t need a peek into anyone’s delivery room (except I already watched one Kardash birth, so the second one is probably okay to watch for the sake of consistency).  And that Lifetime movie where Rob Lowe plays Drew Peterson &#8212; I get to watch that televisual travesty, right?!  Yeah, that’s fine.  And what if <em>The Shore</em> and <em>Kardash</em> are in marathon mode on a Saturday and I’m doing laundry?  Then I can watch them all I want because that doesn’t even count.  *Self high-five*</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a person with general anxiety disorder, one of my not-so-favorite pastimes includes imagining the death of my pets.  Don’t worry, it’s not an all-the-time thing, it’s a worrying process smooshed in there with contemplating my failures, considering the nasty thoughts my colleagues and superiors are harboring toward me and imagining my own (surely imminent) death in a fiery car or airplane crash.  But, out of all these anxieties, the pet ones have the most emotional hold on me.  Where the others remain a constant buzzing of the brain, an endlessly critical and overly careful set of voices in my head, the pet worries actually bring tears to my eyes and an ache to my heart.</p>
<p>I love both of my dachshund boys.  Rupert is all stubborn personality and ass (he’s got a big one). To Rupert, everything is about Rupert &#8212; feeding Rupert, letting Rupert sleep and sometimes, when he feels like it, carrying Rupert like a baby.  Add burrowing under blankets and searching for floor foods and you’ve got a good chunk of his autobiography.  My husband and I have had Rup since he was a grumpy puppy who couldn’t believe the kind of miseries we subjected him to.  “Grass?!  You expect me to walk in this stuff?  Ohmygod, is that a BEE?!”</p>
<p>I adopted Enzo after we’d had Rupert for a few years.  I say “I” because my husband, Matt, wasn’t so sure about him.  A half wiener dog with behavioral issues due to previous abuse with a side of deep seated man-fear?  What’s not to love?  His first day with us he clung to me for dear life and we cried &#8212; he for being left in a new place with a jerky big butt dachshund, and me for adopting him a.k.a. tearing him away from his “proper” home and the caretaker he loved.  When Matt first approached him with the leash, Enzo bit him and ran away while pooping himself, but with time and many French fries, they became best buds.  I think Enzo and I have always been joined at the hip (or his nose to my ankle) because Enzo is an anxious and needy person’s dog dream come true.  He always comes when called (heck, he comes when any other dog is called) and he’s always down for a cuddle.  You want to hug Enzo like a teddy bear?  OK, he’ll do that.  You need someone who understands that things like cars and bikes, men and loud little children can be mean and dangerous?  Enzo’s your guy!  We may live in fear, but we do so together.</p>

<p>But what do you do when your fuzzy friend in fear succumbs to your worst fears?  </p>
<p>A few weeks ago Enzo was diagnosed with degenerative disc disorder.  All of those flashes of him on the vet table, Matt and I comforting him, holding him, his little eyes confused then closing as he’s put to sleep in our hands, these flashes became so much realer and too terrifyingly true.  I cry like a fool when this worrying is completely unwarranted &#8212; with a real illness to deal with, you can imagine I was a total mess.  Because a disc had slipped out of his spinal cord, Enzo lost feeling in his rear half.  No tail stub tic-tocking his emotions, no bladder control.  His walking became a pathetic tugging of his splayed hind legs across the carpet.   The Anxiety Girl’s dream dog was fulfilling her worst nightmares.  </p>
<p>We immediately put the dog on crate rest so as not to further disturb his back.  We took him to our vet and got him pain pills, we drove him to Ann Arbor to see a neurologist, but that’s all we could do.  An MRI priced at $2000 could tell us if the exploded disc was disappearing on its own or required surgery.  A $6000 surgery could then either 1.) get the pup on the road to rehab and recovery or 2.) at least insure he wouldn’t be in pain.  With the second possibility Enzo would remain paralyzed but could become a candidate for little doggie back wheels.  </p>
<p>Well, we had already spent $500 on the appointments and meds and we didn’t have any more to give financially.  We had tons more to give in terms of care and love.  Worst feeling ever.  As a family we were pretty much at rock bottom. . . until we got word that Rupert, who was vacationing with Matt’s family, had eaten some rat poison he found in his cabin getaway.  Okay, thanks, Rup *THAT* was rock bottom.   He’s fine.  He apparently has an iron stomach and is some kind of doggie freak show wonder according the vet.  Anyway, this is finally when things started changing.</p>

<p>The Ann Arbor vet, Dr. Issacs, and his team at the Dogwood Veterinary Referral Center (at the pleading of Andrea Conklin, a neuro vet tech and Enzo’s saintly “dog mom” from above) decided that they could give us everything, the MRI and the surgery at cost.  Andrea set up a Chip-In site where people could donate money towards Enzo’s now $2000 care plan and boom, our fate wasn’t quite as sealed as it had seemed.   </p>
<p>Old friends, new friends, Facebook acquaintances, the moms and grandpas of people we’d met 5 years ago, people we’ve never heard of before &#8212; everyone started sending us money.  And Enzo got what he needed.  It happened too fast to understand fully but it’s kind of miraculous.  My dog, my baby boy, our Colonel Peebody, our little buddy is alive and working on getting better.  All my worrying and anxiety came to fruition in Enzo’s broken little body.  We’ve had to carry his limp behind and express his bladder and see pain in his confused stare and send playful dorky Rupert away, but the people around us keep giving and helping. </p>
<p>That’s the part that my sick premonitions forgot to mention.  When the body gives out and the money runs out, your people will be there.  People will care for a creature in need out of sympathy or empathy or because they love his old man eyebrows and bushy mustache, or simply because they love you enough to keep the nightmares at bay for a little while longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s best, when trying to be a crazy dog lady, to start with a stacked deck.  If possible, get born into a family that considers the dachshund of the house to be your equal and sibling.  My only sister, for example, was a dachshund-beagle mix named Panfila (may she rest in peace), and residing below her in the hierarchy of my family has taught me much about proper human-pet relations.  As the eldest child, she reserved the right to sit in the front passenger seat on all car rides and she was allowed to sleep in my parents’ room whether her nights were fraught with bad dreams or not.  I learned quickly that I was part of Panfi’s pack, she was part of our family and that, as they say, was that.  This kind of familial environment creates a nice sturdy base for all your future craziness.  </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3632" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/09/how-to-be-a-crazy-wiener-dog-lady/dog/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dog.jpg" data-orig-size="120,166" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dog" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dog.jpg?w=120" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dog.jpg?w=120" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dog.jpg?w=640" alt="portrait" title="dog"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-3632" /> Remember to do as my family did and make sure the dog eats exactly what you eat.  A little bit of egg with breakfast kibble, perhaps some cereal, and so on throughout the day.  A fat dog is a happy dog.  Or a Mexican dog.  I forget which.  Also, make sure to hang a picture of her on the Wall of Fame with all the other family photos.  She should look as elegant and glorious as a dachshund-beagle posing in a 70s yellow town car can look.</p>
<p>Beyond the excellent and already cray-cray upbringing, the young dog-lady-in-training should dedicate herself to a multifaceted general canine education.  The desire to obsess over doxies and doxies alone is powerful, I know, but push yourself to understand other breeds&mdash;you never know if your future dachshund son is going to bring home a bulldog girlfriend.  It’s best to be prepared.  Dedicating oneself to such studies early in life will be to your advantage; becoming literate in all things dog-related will be accepted as cute or lauded as a precocious interest in learning.  The dorkiness of your pursuits may easily go unseen.  Take advantage of this for as long as possible as you may someday wish to go on dates or become a respectable member of the community.  But I digress.</p>
<p>On library days at school the young doggie lover should peruse periodicals like <em>Dog Fancy</em> (or <em>Cat Fancy</em> if that’s all that is in at that time&mdash;it doesn’t hurt to know the enemy).  Introduce yourself to the genre of pet apotheosis in its many forms and varieties.  Do your research.  Watch episodes of <em>Lassie</em>&mdash;if you’re saddened by the black-and-white tones, the plaintive call for the old girl, the paw outstretched to you the viewer at once breaking the 4th wall and your heart, then you are well on your way!

Select your dachshund puppies when they are teeny and at their peak helplessness and/or adopt a wiener mutt with a very sad history.  Their desperate, needy nature will help bond you to your new kin.  We all know that you can’t spell “smother” without “mother,” right?!  Now, metaphorically take a string and tie a little knot around your happiness.  Got it?  Good.  Proceed by tying the other end of that string to your dog children.  Now you’re getting somewhere.  Signs of crazy wiener dog lady success? Your Facebook is dominated by photos and stories about your dogs’ daily adventures, you religiously check in with <a href="http://dachshundlove.blogspot.com/">The Long and the Short of it: A Dachshund Dog News Magazine</a> to feel plugged into your dachshund community, all birthdays and holidays are commemorated with dachshund paraphernalia and myriad wiener punning Hallmark cards.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you know what your dog would say in any given situation (or you’re sure that he’s actually saying it) and you live each day with the crippling fear that your four-legged friend might leave you (or you’re completely in denial that death is even a viable doggie option), well then, you’re doing it right.<br />
Welcome to the club!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, it’s me, Ana Holguin.  You might remember me from such <em>Idler</em> posts as <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/27/on-how-she-slays-me-halloween-and-every-day/">“Why you should watch <em>Buffy</em>”</a> and <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/13/1142/">“Why I love <em>My So-Called Life</em>”</a> and <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/15/mad-childhood/">“Musings about the children in <em>Mad Men</em>.”</a>  And yes, here I am once again bringing you good tidings of a televisual persuasion.</p>
<p>I know, I know, you’re thinking, “but, Ana, TV is not your beat!  It’s your duty to guide us through the many facets of the pop-cultural universe with a feminist sensibility and a dash of wit.  Why this hang up on the boob tube, that mind-deadening never-blinking eye of doom?!”</p>
<p>Dear Reader, to you I respectfully say “calm thyself.”  There is plenty of time for all that is pop.  This week I must champion yet another television program as we are facing a cable emergency&mdash;<em>Terriers</em>, my favorite new show of the season, could get canceled! </p>
<p>Clearly, you do not know a lot about <em>Terriers</em>, otherwise you’d be watching it every Wednesday night at 10 pm on F/X and it wouldn’t be suffering in the ratings.  Don’t worry, I’m here to help.</p>

As a crazy dog lady myself, I can tell you that if you’re tuning in for cute doggage alone, you’ll be pretty disappointed.  However, if you like a good private detective drama and just happen to be a crazy dog person, you will be rewarded with regular guest appearances by a dapper young bulldog named “Winston.”  So there’s that.  From what I can gather, I believe the show bears its title as a way of alluding to the plucky mettle of its main characters&mdash;a couple of dudes whose bite is worse than their bark, so to speak.  Tenacious and clever they are; muscle-bound, fanged and frightening they are not.</p>
<p>The show follows these two “terrier” guys, Hank Dolworth (Donal Logue) and Britt Pollack (Michael Raymond-James), who work as private investigators unburdened by the intricacies of things like say, following the letter of the law.  Hank, a former police detective, has been kicked off the squad and moves “down” to his current occupation.  Britt moves “up” from life as a petty criminal to become Hank’s partner/sidekick.  The two meet in the middle and carry on from there solving cases for clients and righting wrongs as they see fit along the way.</p>

I wasn’t blown away at first, I’ll admit it.  But this is just the outer shell of the story and the program has quite a bit more to offer.  Stick with <em>Terriers</em> beyond the first few episodes and you’ll find that the quirky private eye adventures served up each week actually are the secondary focus of the show while character relationships compose the true heart.  Each episode explores how these two men negotiate and re-negotiate their contract with one another as colleagues, partners and best friends.  Beyond this, Hank’s personal history slowly unfurls episode by episode as Britt’s shiny future with his live-in girlfriend Katie (Laura Allen) speeds forward.  Hank’s past issues with alcoholism, a painful divorce and a brilliant mentally ill sister all tangle into his present in a way that fleshes out his character to both his partner and the audience at once.  The show is constantly moving, turning and incorporating more character threads in such a way that the flashy Private Dick premise dims in the presence of the devastatingly simple human question of “how do we best live with and love other people?”</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you like seeing men in roles that complicate and break free from the norms of masculinity, give <em>Terriers</em> a try.  Hank and Britt are smart, savvy, playful, funny, loving, caring, romantic, dorky, etc. and satisfyingly so.  And they’ll still punch a jerk in the face and drive fast and all that action jazz.</li>
<li>If you like cop shows/detective dramas, give <em>Terriers</em> a chance.  It gives you the weekly adrenaline rush and puzzle-solving while maintaining a cool and sometimes silly comic tone and a dramatic/meaningful core.  Think <em>Oceans Eleven</em>&mdash;it’s produced by the guy who re-wrote <em>Oceans</em> for the neo-Rat Pack of Clooney, Pitt, Damon, et al.</li>
<li>Lastly, to me, <em>Terriers</em> is basically a mature, man version of <em>Veronica Mars</em> (a program that left us much too early due to lack of ratings) and even though I’m wary of seeing the world through the male point of view yet a-freaking-gain, I still endorse this show whole-heartedly.  If you haven’t seen <em>Veronica Mars</em> and you have no idea what I’m talking about, well then, I urge you to investigate that case yourself, Reader darling, because that is a blog for another day.</li>
</ol>
