										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At last. This experiment is finally at an end.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>By sort of, I mean I defeated the game&mdash;specifically Sephiroth in all of his forms&mdash;and watched the end movies.</p>
<p>But am I finished? Hardly. There is a lot of game left. Sigh.</p>
<p>I saved in the North Crater just before the final battles, which allows me to go back and fill in the gaps in the game later.</p>
<p>Will I go back and try to beat Ruby and Emerald weapon? Maybe. It will be difficult to find motivation now that I am finished with the main storyline.</p>
<p>The final leg of the game was very frustrating&mdash;not in regards to its difficulty, but in structure. I just wanted to fight the final bosses, and not have to spend time dividing up my party and deciding which character gets which materia.</p>
<p>I had my main party of Cloud, Cid, and Yuffie loaded for bear&mdash;but the game made me split up my party on two occasions, and anyone who was not in my main party had their materia stripped. I tried to “share the wealth” when it came to my higher-level characters, as I was not sure what kind of fights the other parties, if any, they would get into.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to one of my main complaints about <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>: <strong>the materia system</strong>.</p>
<p>While it can make for some fun and unique gameplay, it really took a lot of the enjoyment out of the game. There were more than a few times where I considered playing, but did not because I did not want to spend 20 minutes re-equipping my party’s materia.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: I still loved playing through the game. Its story and characters hold up very well. But I’m tired of equipping materia. I’m tired of mastering materia. I’m tired of even looking at materia.</p>
<p>Upon beating the game Monday evening, my first revelation was: “Now I’ll have more time for other things.”</p>
<p>I hate confessing to such a statement, as I enjoyed the game, but let’s face facts: that’s 70+ hours of my life I’ll never get back. I try not to think about what else I could do during that time.</p>
<p>This was a fun experiment, but it did remind me why I enjoy portable gaming much more these days. It is difficult for me to schedule out an hour or so to sit down in front of my PlayStation. It is much easier to play a game here and there on my Nintendo DSi, thanks to the quick-save option of most games.</p>
<p>How did the final battles go? It wasn’t even close. Cloud was at level 81; he was equipped with Slash-All and Ultima Weapon. The first boss fight with Jenova lasted all of two or three minutes.</p>
<p>Boss battles are easier when your main fighter can routinely dish out 9999 points of damage. Boom.</p>
<p>Bizarro-Sephiroth took a little time, only due to his many parts and having to switch between three parties. If I go back and try to beat the game again after finishing all the side quests, I may see if I can just take BS on with my main party of Cloud, Cid, and Yuffie.</p>
<p>Safer-Sephiroth was also fairly easy, and had Cid still been in my party (I replaced him with Tifa when splitting folks up), it would have gone even faster. Big Guard and Regen did save my bacon when Sephiroth used his two minute long (ugh) summon on the party though.</p>
<p>And yes, I had a moment of geeky nostalgia when “One-Winged Angel” began playing.</p>
<p>The end video was enjoyable, although I think I like the second ending after the last of the credits a bit more. The visuals are a bit more striking.</p>
<p>To get to the point, if there even is one, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> holds up and while parts of it can be annoying (read: materia), it is still a landmark game.</p>
<p>I think I’m gonna go read a book now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised last week, it’s done. Sephiroth has gone down.</p>
<p><strong>The logistics:</strong> I’ve been playing with the final battle party, and while my last go-round might have worked if the game hadn’t frozen up on me, I did things a bit differently this time. Before making my way into the Northern Crater, I stocked up on HP Plus materia. None of the materia could measure up to the near-mastered one Cloud is carrying around, but even an extra 10% makes a difference. Last time I gave each character fighting Bizzaro Sephiroth at least one orb, but this time I maxed out Cloud, Vincent, and Cid, who would go on to battle Safer Sephiroth by themselves.</p>
<p>Also, I didn’t really go overboard on materia. At this point in the game, you don’t have to fill every slot, and you have to balance each material against the HP and strength penalties that most of them inflict. I have mastered fire, ice, lightning, and poison material, and they all stayed on the side, since none of them can really do enough damage to be worth including. The Cloud, Vincent, and Cid party roughly line up with <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/10/ffvii-character-and-materia-management/">Andrew’s optimum party</a>, with Vincent filling the Yuffie/Tifa role of primary healer, Cloud using haste and double cut (I love that materia), and Cid using barrier and summons. I’m actually pretty light on backup material, but my #2 party were set with Tifa using a second mastered restore materia (absolutely necessary, and somehow I’d forgotten I had one during my first attempt to beat the game), Red XIII using my best enemy skill materia for big guard (haste and wall all at once) and my second best summons, and Barret acting mostly as a big gun.</p>
<p>Even with a moderately-leveled party (Cloud: 61, Vincent: 56, Cid: 60, Barret: 54, Tifa: 56, Red XIII: 52), Jenova SYNTHESIS and Bizarro Sephiroth are really no trouble. I cast the defensive haste/wall/regen combo for both, but Jenova went down using only standard attacks before she even got to the ultima countdown.</p>
<p>Bizzaro Sephiroth has multiple components which can be beaten separately, but defeating the torso defeats the whole thing. Last time through I took down the right and left magics, but I didn’t beat the left core with my secondary party, so the right core wasn’t vulnerable, and I defeated the torso without defeating the core. This time I was more thorough, and defeated each of the individual pieces, making sure to let the head regenerate so that I could kill it as often as possible.</p>
<p>Because according to the Final Fantasy Wiki, <a target="new" href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Safer%E2%88%99Sephiroth">each time you kill Bizzaro Sephiroth’s head, Safer Sephiroth’s max HP is reduced by 100</a>. Last time, as I mentioned, the game froze up during Safer Sephiroth’s Super Nova summon. This time, he didn’t even get the chance to cast it.</p>
<p>Even better, I met my <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Safer%E2%88%99Sephiroth">week 9</a> goal, finishing the game with the timer at 42:40, which of course doesn&#8217;t count the time involved in the final battles, much less the two failed attempts, but still feels pretty close to the 40 hours I budgeted for the game.</p>
<p><strong>The story:</strong> Might I say, holy crap?</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSNPiJ8fUe4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>As with Aeris’s untimely departure, I was already aware of the broad strokes. Sephiroth’s death releases Holy, but Meteor is already hovering over Midgar, destroying the city. Cait Sith states that he’s had as many people as possible take cover in the slums under the city, but there doesn’t seem to be any way to stop Meteor.</p>
<p>And then the planet itself comes to life, green filaments of the Lifestream covering the entire planet and taking Meteor apart.</p>
<p>And that’s where the game ends.</p>
<p>Ignoring the increasingly numerous sequels, this is a rather striking finale. A number of characters state during the game that if the planet decides to save itself, it isn’t clear that saving humans will be part of the deal&mdash;the various Weapons, which attack human cities when they’re roused by the approach of Meteor, are an embodiment of this possibility.</p>
<p>Which is all to say that at the end of the game, the planet, assisted by Holy, defeats Meteor, <em>but the game doesn’t reveal whether this action leaves a single human survivor</em>. A coda after the credits shows Red XIII and two cubs looking out over the overgrown ruins of Midgar, so it’s clear that life continues, but not necessarily human life.</p>
<p>In fact, I initially forgot all about the mind-bending as to who Cloud is or isn’t, and I’m inclined to ignore sequels like <em>Advent Children</em> and <em>Dirge of Cerebus</em>, which establish that, yes, everyone survives, and Cloud keeps sulking. In all honesty, it feels like a bit of a cop out.</p>
<p>So that’s it. Only 13 years late, I can finally say that I’ve finished <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. Up until the end it was a solid but not extraordinary entry in the series, but the ending might have pushed it right up close to the top for me. I’ve still spent more time (80+ hours) loving <em>X</em>, which has a somewhat dark ending itself, but it still can&#8217;t compare to the possible extinction of humanity. As a happy ending.</p>

<p>Well, sort of. Real men, as a friend quipped, kill Emerald Weapon, not Sephiroth, for old time’s sake. And, I suppose, he’s right, considering how easy it is to bear Sephiroth, but it doesn’t make me any less happy to be done with the game. Don’t here what I am not saying, I love <em>FFVII</em> but years later the flaws it has (and there are many) are more glaring at the age of thirty-one. I’ve complained a bit about <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/17/cid/">the puerility of some of the characters</a>, so I’ll spare you this time around (and it was written for teenagers, to be fair). There are a few of us, understandably who find <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/27/ffvii-swap-meet/">the materia and character management cumbersome</a>, but that is sort of a JRPG thing to do. Also, the last cutscenes don’t have any voice acting which, considering the grandness of them (for the time), seems off-putting. It’s almost as if they ran out of budget or were just in a rush. Then again, maybe modern games just have me spoiled.</p>
<p>Lastly, and I don’t think anybody has mentioned this, it doesn’t pass the beer and pizza test. Simply put, YOU HAVE TO PRESS A BUTTON TO RUN.  The moment I take one hand off the controller progress is slowed. That quick bite to eat or pull from a beer bottle interrupts the flow of the game. This, honestly, was the single most frustrating aspect of the RPG. Obviously, there are game genres, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idZ9C0Qtj2A">the classic platformer</a> is certainly one of them, where your only recourse is to pause to nibble and quaff, but any game that requires extensive walking, to help suggest the largeness of world, shouldn’t make use more than the controller&#8217;s left keypad to move. That’s just simply bad user experience. Period.</p>
<p>All that said, they didn’t cheat us by putting hours of required grinding like so many games do to extend the time of gameplay*. I blazed through the game in about nineteen hours with Cloud at level 68 (and I could have done it faster), using <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/10/ffvii-character-and-materia-management/">a pretty standard materia layout</a>. With such an easy last boss, the only real cookie they give you is the cut scene and glorious beatdown of Sephiroth at the end.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4CNM89W9k0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>All the good stuff is really after you’ve completed the game, another whole twenty hours of content (level grinding, chocobo breeding and racing, Weapon killing, Knights-of-the-Round-getting) that was optional. And all of it takes time, effort, and skill which, I suppose, means I may never be a real man.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>*<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aip2aIt0ROM&amp;feature=channel_video_title">This</a> is a NSFW video that illustrates perfectly the cheats developers use to extend gameplay.</p>

<p>I put in a decent amount of time over the weekend. But, I probably only progressed in the story about maybe an hour.</p>
<p>You’re thinking, “huh?” or more likely, &#8220;Cripes, when is this blog series going to <em>end?</em>&#8221; Well. I spent too much time mastering materia and trying out some side-quests. <span id="more-4424"></span></p>
<p>First, I mastered my Long Range materia, so it would create a new one, and gave it to Cid.</p>
<p>Now, Cloud, Yuffie, and Cid can all attack from the back row without penalty. And to bring the non-geeks up to speed, placing a character in the back row means they take less damage&#8211;but, unless they have a long range weapon (or the materia in question), they deal less damage.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>. That is something I&#8217;m way more aware of at 29 versus 16.</p>
<p>Then, I decided to master Cloud’s Counter Attack materia to also generate a new one. Here was my plan: I would give Cloud both Counter Attacks, meaning he would attack twice for each hit he took.</p>
<p>Combine these with Cloud’s mastered Cover materia, and he’s blocking a lot of hits, thus leading to multiple counter attacks. Cloud can slaughter most random foes within a turn or two, all while leaving Cid and Yuffie for support.</p>
<p>Not a bad plan. It just took some time (even with it placed on Cid’s triple growth weapon).</p>
<p>After I got the sub in the main storyline, I decided to go for the Gelnika side-quest. This is a crashed airship filled with some helpful materia and weapons.</p>
<p>It is also where you can Morph a bunch of enemies into stat-boosting Source items. I probably spent an hour or so just Morphing critters to boost my characters stats. Having Yuffie’s Conformer weapon helped considerably.</p>
<p><strong>A side note:</strong> I had to fight Reno and Rude in the airship, and I finally got to use Cloud’s Omnislash limit break.</p>
<p>Oh. My. <em>Goodness</em>.</p>
<p>Buying Omnislash was worth all the work in the Battle Arena. It took Reno and Rude out on the first turn. Granted, it helps that Cloud is near to level 70 and has a +30 strength bonus (thanks to my other Battle Arena buy, the Championship Belt), but still—it was a sight to witness.</p>
<p><strong>End side note</strong></p>
<p>After realizing <a href="http://idler-mag.com/author/andrewsim0ne/">Andrew</a> and <a href="http://idler-mag.com/author/craiggav/">Gavin</a>, my fellow players at <em>The Idler</em>, were ready to finish the game at any moment, I figured I should stop wasting time.</p>
<p>While arranging materia to fight Diamond Weapon, I realized I somehow got Cloud’s max HP to 7777.</p>
<p>Again, let’s back up for the non-geeks: In <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, if a character’s HP gets to 7777, that character gets a serious attack bonus, called Lucky 7’s. The character in question keeps attacking, with each hit doing 7777 points of damage.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing—usually, your character has to have more than 7777 max hit points, and then be injured to reach the magic number. In my case, Cloud was already at the number—for every battle.</p>
<p>On a whim, I maxed his HP and went into a random battle. Cloud got the bonus and destroyed a cluster of small enemies.</p>
<p>Then, I had a thought: could I use this advantage to take on Emerald Weapon? It is an underwater creature and one of the strongest in the game (rumored to have 1 million HP). Defeating it would give a bunch of killer items.</p>
<p>I’ll cut to the chase and say that even with the Lucky 7 bonus, and Cloud’s near-never ending hits of 7777, I still couldn’t kill the dang thing. I did the math too—if Cloud actually attacked the rumored 64 times granted by the bonus, I&#8217;d barely cut Emerald Weapon’s HP in half.</p>
<p>And sadly, once Cloud leveled up after my fight with Diamond Weapon, he no longer had the automatic bonus.</p>
<p>Enough wasting time: I gotta finish this dang game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many people, I&#8217;ve played more <em>Final Fantasy</em> games than I&#8217;ve finished. I&#8217;ve spent significant time playing <em>Final Fantasies I</em>, <em>III</em>, <em>IV</em>, <em>VII</em>, <em>X</em>, <em>X-2</em>, and <em>XIII</em>, but I&#8217;ve only beaten <em>I</em>, <em>IV</em>, <em>X</em>, and <em>X-2</em>. Some of the titles, like <em>XII</em> and <em>XIII</em>, it&#8217;s really a matter of time&mdash;that is, I just haven&#8217;t spent enough time playing the game to get anywhere near far enough to finish the storyline. (This was also the case with <em>I</em> when I was a kid. It&#8217;s hard to devote that much time to a game when you can only play it at your baby-sitter&#8217;s house. I finally took care of the problem a couple of years ago playing the GBA version on my DS.)</p>
<p>However, with <em>Final Fantasy III</em>, it&#8217;s something different. I&#8217;ve played though nearly all of the storyline (and that early in the series, there really aren&#8217;t all that many side quests). I&#8217;ve reached the final battle. But I lost. More than once.</p>
<p>In most games, I just get up and try again, but the final battle in an RPG like a <em>Final Fantasy</em> game is a grand extended affair. At the very least, you normally have to beat the final enemy at least twice&mdash;after you beat him/her/it once, he/she/it changes form, takes on some new powers, and comes at you harder than the first time. (Which is counterintuitive, if you think about it. Wouldn&#8217;t you bring the big guns the first time, and be <em>weaker</em> after you&#8217;ve had the crap kicked out of you once? Oh well. Such is the genre.) In <em>Final Fantasy III</em> you actually have to fight four bosses before the final enemy. Which isn&#8217;t so bad.</p>
<p>Except that it takes time.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4459" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4459" data-attachment-id="4459" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/17/ffvii-so-close/darkcloud3d/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/darkcloud3d.jpg" data-orig-size="267,257" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="DarkCloud3D" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/darkcloud3d.jpg?w=267" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/darkcloud3d.jpg?w=267" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/darkcloud3d.jpg?w=640" alt="Cloud of Darkness" title="DarkCloud3D"   class="size-full wp-image-4459" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/darkcloud3d.jpg 267w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/darkcloud3d.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4459" class="wp-caption-text">FFIII&#039;s Cloud of Darkness</p></div> In <em>Final Fantasy III</em>, there&#8217;s at least a half hour of walking around and fighting between the last save point and Cloud of Darkness (the final enemy). When you lose the fight, you get dumped back at the save point and have to do it all over again. The technical term for this, I believe is getting <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/06/housed/">housed</a>, and I would describe the final battle of any RPG as a structural housing&mdash;a housing built into the nature of the game itself.</p>
<p>To make things worse, the final tower in <em>Final Fantasy III</em> is surround by a huge maze, which takes 30-40 minutes to walk/fight through. So even leaving the area is a huge investment. And you&#8217;ve going to have to walk back through the maze to get back to the tower to fight the final set of battles again.</p>
<p>So after a few failed attempts, I gave up. Being an older game, <em>FFIII</em> doesn&#8217;t have much in the way of a story to justify the effort if beating the game wasn&#8217;t proving to be worthwhile on its own.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about this, you ask? Because I tried to beat <em>FFVII</em> this week and failed. Twice.</p>
<p>The first time was my own fault. The final battle against Sephiroth splits you your group into one, two, or three different battle parties (I seem to get two pretty consistently), and I set things up all wrong. I somehow forgot that I had two mastered restore materia, and set up my primary group with materia that topped out at Cure 2. That didn&#8217;t go over well against Safer Sephiroth. The second time was even worse.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ye0dJhSH_LU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I beat Bizzaro Sephiroth pretty handily (Jenova Synthesis has never given me much trouble), and the final group was set up as it should be. (Somehow Vincent has made his way into my primary battle party. I&#8217;m not sure how that happened, but I&#8217;m going with it. He fills the Yuffie/Tifa role in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/10/ffvii-character-and-materia-management/">Andrew&#8217;s optimal battle party</a>.) I was holding my own, and Sephiroth pulled out his Super Nova summon, which at nearly two full minutes to watch, is about a minute-and-a-half too long. I was a bit worried because the attack is capable of inflicting more damage than Vincent&#8217;s current max HP, and as my primary healer, it would take me a few turns to get everyone back in shape again, but my entire team was at full health, so I was hoping, just hoping that I could get past the attack and beat Sephiroth before he got a chance to do it again.</p>
<p>And then the game froze. Right after Jupiter explodes.</p>
<p>There was nothing I could do but turn off my PS3 and try again.</p>
<p>Next week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#8217;s been apparent to anyone reading my posts over the past few weeks that I felt like I&#8217;d hit a wall in Final Fantasy VII.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think it&#8217;s been apparent to anyone reading my posts over the past few weeks that I felt like I&#8217;d hit a wall in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. I&#8217;d been playing the game for more than two months, and it felt like I wasn&#8217;t getting anywhere. I was getting antsy. Last week, happily, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/03/ffvii-2/">I finally made it to disc 2</a>.</p>
<p>And this week I&#8217;m on disc 3.</p>
<p>Before I talk about the last week&#8217;s gameplay, let me say that this is a fairly common phenomenon for me with RPGs. There&#8217;s a lot of time in the initial investment, and then there&#8217;s a point where suddenly the end is in sight and getting there becomes an all-consuming drive. I&#8217;d like to say that it&#8217;s a nod to the quality of the experience, but it really more likely has something to do with my own somewhat compulsive nature. Suddenly, everything is within reach. If I want a legendary weapon, I just have to go get it. (Even if that means dodging a lightning bolt 200 times. Small price to pay for break damage limit and 1-MP.)</p>
<p>So this week was that week for me. As promised, I ignored the side quests almost entirely and blazed through the story. And <em>FFVII</em> pulls out the big guns on disc 2. (Almost like they&#8217;re making up for something. . .) The 3D world map finally takes on its full awesomeness as you fly over it. And you have to stop a runaway train! Fight an army! (Actually not as cool as it could be. A big &#8220;meh&#8221; for Fort Condor.) Oh, and you get on a rocket and fly. Into. Space.</p>
<p>Sure, you fly into space in <em>FFIV</em>, or at least the game tells you that&#8217;s what happens, but really it&#8217;s just that one minute you&#8217;re on the planet and the next you&#8217;re on the moon. The rocket launch in <em>FFVII</em> is a fairly genuine holy crap moment. Or probably was in 1997, and could be again in high-def. (You hear me, SquareEnix? Soon!)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lB6vl2ejqTw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>But more importantly, to me, we finally get a bit more on Cloud and Tifa. In fact, at this point in the game, Cloud is basically the Joker. No so much perhaps in his random bloodthirstiness (although we&#8217;ve killed many monsters and not a few soldiers) as in the fact that he has two competing and entirely incompatible origin narratives going on. <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/03/ffvii-disc-two/">As Daniel noted</a>, at the end of disc 1, Sephiroth claims that Cloud is a failed clone, and only a few years old. Cloud&#8217;s memories of himself before then are actually the memories of a man named Zack who was in SOLDIER, had spiky hair, and was Aerith&#8217;s first love. Sephiroth manipulates Cloud into giving him the black materia, and Cloud goes into a coma.</p>
<p>When the team finds Cloud in disc 2, Tifa stays with him while the team goes off to do some other stuff, not important. (Fort Condor. Ugh.) When the team comes back to visit, the damaged planet breaks open and swallows an entire town, including Cloud and Tifa. Inside the lifestream, the pair examine Cloud&#8217;s memories and discover that Cloud was actually present in Nibelheim when Sephiroth discovered Jenova, but as a faceless soldier, not as a proud member of SOLDIER. (It all makes sense in the game, really.) Cloud kills Sephiroth, rescues Zack and Tifa, and is experimented on by Shinra. So he really is the person Tifa knew as a child, altered by Shinra, but not created as a failed clone.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll find out at the end.</p>
<p>Which, by the way, I&#8217;m going to try to do this week. I feel a bit underpowered, but I always feel underpowered at the end. More than anything, after going through the whole game with a three-member combat party, it feels a bit weird to have to equip everyone for the final fight. I&#8217;m going to have some pretty low-level materia in a few people&#8217;s hands. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no greater boon for gaming than two days of moderate sickness.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.andrewsimone.com/clusterflock/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Greenshot_2011-03-09_18-48-03.png" title="battle arena" class="alignnone" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>As I am sure you recall, the last week or two I’ve been avoiding the game out of my contempt for <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/03/ffvii-golden-chocobo/">battle arena and chocobo grinding</a>. This weekend, however, I took stock of the situation and decided that pushing forward to disk 3, skipping the chocobo breeding and the battle arena, would yield rewards that would help me achieve all the goodies I desired more efficiently. (That’s the official story anyway, but I suspect Daniel and Gavin understand I didn’t want them to progress further than me.)</p>
<p>The strategy for the battle arena is exceedingly unsophisticated once you hit disk 3: mastered HP Plus, Mega All, ultimate weapon, Mystile Armor,  Enemy Skill, and hold down ‘O’. Restore is almost totally unnecessary since White Wind can serve in a pinch (e.g., when armor is broken). Counter Attack and Added Effect plus Contain are useful, but generally the monster die too quickly. And <a target="new" href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Shield_(Status)">Shield</a> is perfect ace in the hole for that eighth battle. The only real difficulty involves a first round accessory break.</p>
<p>So, battle arena is done, I just need to get my Golden Chocobo. This means  next week will be this little fella, so I can skip the breeding process entirely.</p>

<p>The <a target="new" href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Ruby_Weapon">Ruby Weapon</a> is probably the hardest fight in the game. The strategy guides all give advice much like <a target="new" href="http://faqs.ign.com/articles/394/394873p1.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kill off two of your characters prior to the battle<br />
Give the remaining character a Mystile armor<br />
Pair Knights of the Round material (preferably with 2 stars) with HP absorb<br />
Pair Command Counter material (mastered) with Mime<br />
Pair Master Summon with MP Turbo (optional)<br />
Equip the W-Summon materia (optional)<br />
Have around 7000-8000 HP</p></blockquote>
<p>All I have, at the moment, is the Mystile armor and the WP-Summon, so it’s going to be more than a little tricky.</p>
<p><strong>Where you at?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disc:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Cloud’s Level:</strong> 66</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> The Northern Crater (I can beat the game at any time.)</p>
<p><strong>Timer:</strong> 18:33</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1031" title="Battle Square Arena" src="https://i2.wp.com/gingerandthegeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Battle_Square_Arena.jpg" alt="Battle Square Arena" width="449" height="330" /></p>
<p>After some crazy twists and turns in the plot, and after Cloud returned to the party, I decided to kill some time in the Battle Square at the Gold Saucer. My brain needed a break. The story is not getting any easier to follow. I feel like I need a flow chart or something.</p>
<p>And kill time at the Battle Square I did. The Battle Square is a mini-game of sorts where you face a series of battles in a row. Why? Good question. Wait, I mean “to win Battle Points.”</p>
<p>Yes. That’s it.</p>
<p>Said Battle Points are traded in for items, ranging from useless to game-breakingly awesome.</p>
<p>I had a few items in my sights: the Speed Plus materia and Cloud’s Omnislash limit break.</p>
<p>Let’s back up for the non-geeks: limit breaks are special attacks your characters can use after taking enough damage.</p>
<p>I suppose the name implies the character has reached his or her “limit” and unleashes a desperation attack.</p>
<p>Y’know, like Popeye not “stands”-ing no more, Michael Douglas freaking out over a can of over priced Coke in <em>Falling Down</em>, or Kat Cooper finding out she just missed a shoe sale.</p>
<p>The limit break in question, Omnislash, is Cloud’s final limit break, and therefore his strongest attack. This was something I never had when I first beat the game, so I wanted to make the effort to grab it.</p>
<p>Easier said than done.</p>
<p>Omnislash costs a hefty 32,000 (yes, <em>thousand</em>) Battle Points. The effort took a decent chunk of time, summed up brilliantly by my girlfriend as “this game seems to be a lot of you doing nothing.”</p>
<p>Well put.</p>
<p>There are a few snags to spending a lot of time in the Battle Square.</p>
<p><strong>1. It costs 10 GP to enter.</strong> GP is the currency only used at the Gold Saucer. You can win GP by playing mini-games, or by waiting for the Gil exchange man to appear randomly in the Ropeway Station.</p>
<p>I don’t have the patience for the mini-games, so I opted for the easier route: the Gil exchange man. This meant a lot of exiting and entering the station until he appeared. And then, he trades you 1 GP per 100 Gil. I maxed out what I could get, 100 GP, it cost me 10,000 Gil.</p>
<p>Good thing I sold a mastered All materia back on Disc 1 for 1.5 million Gil.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you leave the Battle Square area, your Battle Points drop to zero.</strong> Yes. You read that correctly. You could have 20,000 BP, accidentally exit and BOOM—you’re back to zilch.</p>
<p>This happened to me after my first go through. I survived my first time all the way to the end and had a bit over 10,000 BP. I left to save, and whoops—back to zero.</p>
<p>Sounds like my 401K a couple years ago. And speaking of saving&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>3. You have to leave the Battle Square to save</strong>, and it costs 5 GP to save at the Gold Saucer—and if you leave the Saucer, any GP you have goes away. And remember, if you leave to save, you lose all your BP.</p>
<p><strong>4. You’re subjected to a status affecting slot machine after each battle. </strong>Yep. After each win, you can stop or continue. If you keep going, a slots reel pops up and your status is messed with.</p>
<p>If you have the Ribbon equipped, like I did, you won’t get hit with Poison, Toad, or Mini if it pops up. But, there is not stopping the 1/2 HP or Broken [fill in the blank] slots. This is where the challenge comes from. You can go from having 8000 max HP, down to 2000 just like that.</p>
<p>One highlight was a final battle where my sword was broken (mainly less attack power), I couldn’t use items and I was out of MP.</p>
<p>I beat the final guy with Goblin Punch. No lie. It was silly.</p>
<p>Was getting Omnislash worth all the hassle? Man, I hope so.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll go back to get the w-Summon materia. It costs 64,000 BP.</p>

<p>As I said last week, the plot takes a turn toward the crazy once you pop in Disc 2.</p>
<p>But first, I should probably mention who has been in my team as of late, now that I have all of the playable characters.</p>
<p>I used Cloud, Yuffie and Cid to beat the end of Disc 1, but in the early stages of Disc 2, I have been using Cloud, Yuffie and Tifa.</p>
<p>I have made Yuffie my go-to spell caster, since she can be placed in the back row and not suffer any negative attack stats. I got back and forth about using Tifa over Cid—she’s fast and her Strength stat seems to climb more than Cid’s—but I dislike how her Limit Break is a slot machine. It is all up to chance.</p>
<p>The Great Glacier portion of the game nearly drove me insane. No amount of level grinding can help you navigate that maze—and if you are stuck out in the cold for too long, you pass out and have to start over, which was the case with me. <span id="more-4226"></span></p>
<p>But dang it, I was gonna find the Snow Witch and fight her for that Alexander materia, by hook or by crook (which I will probably end up never using that much). The benefit of this silly task was finding the Added Cut materia, which I use all the time (paired with Death Blow).</p>
<p>The point of this section is to get to a massive, ancient crater at the North Pole of Final Fantasy VII’s world.</p>
<p>Why? Because that’s where Sephiroth is gathering his followers and will try to summon Meteor (that’s bad), which will destroy the world (also bad).</p>
<p>Once you get to the crater, that’s when things get super-nutty.</p>
<p><strong>SPOILER ALERT!</strong></p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p>To make a long story short, you find out that Cloud is merely a pieced together (and failed) Sephiroth clone made by Shinra, and was injected with false memories and Jenova cells (the big baddy from outer space).</p>
<p><em>What-the-what?</em></p>
<p>Cloud is a puppet of Sephiroth—the Jenova cells in Cloud’s body allow Sephiroth to control him. The cells, I believe, also made Tifa think she knew Cloud from her past, when in fact she never did (at least not this Cloud. Oy).</p>
<p>Got all that?</p>
<p><strong>Here is my theory:</strong> Sephiroth is not really Sephiroth. The famous Sephiroth has been dead for a few years, and was absorbed into the Life Stream, to some extent, which allowed Jenova to begin to regrow itself.</p>
<p>The Sephiroth Cloud has been following is actually Jenova, taking Sephiroth’s form.</p>
<p>Jenova is attempting to “reassemble” itself—meaning, it is gathering all of the clones injected with its cells and such (which includes Cloud). Jenova wants to harm the planet again, and it needs all of its pieces to do so. Cloud was made in hopes he would lead Shinra to Sephiroth and the Promised Land (which he sort of did).</p>
<p>I <em>think</em>.</p>
<p>Like most <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, the plot has several villains, and usually there are villains behind the scenes that we do not see until we’re much deeper into the game (the “puppet master” if you will). In the first half of Disc 1, it was Shinra. Then it was Sephiroth. Now, it is Jenova and Meteor.</p>
<p>After the events at the crater, the whole world goes to hell. Giant, powerful monsters, the guardians of the planet, are awoken. Cloud is missing. And Tifa was about to be executed in a gas chamber, but escapes.</p>
<p>Oh, and you finally get the Highwind airship.</p>
<p>To me, this is where the game <em>really</em> starts. Buckle up.</p>
<p><strong>Where you at?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disc:</strong> 2</p>
<p><strong>Cloud’s Level:</strong> 57 (but he is missing!)</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> Junon area</p>
<p><strong>Timer:</strong> 52:24</p>
