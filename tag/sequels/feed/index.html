					<description><![CDATA[Playing a new game is like a first date. You're interested but tentative. Something about the game is attractive, and you want to get to know it better. Most of the time, you've even shelled out a dinner-worthy $20-60, but you're still figuring out whether the game is worth a more substantial, long-term relationship.

And sometimes you go on a lot of first dates before you get a second date.

Are there articles in gaming magazines about the dullness, the lethargy, the lack of will to explore a new virtual world that follows a particularly intense gaming experience? If not, then let me be the first unhappy volunteer. <a target="new" href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/08/339/">Last week</a> I wrote about the joy of finishing a great video game. This week every pixel seems less intense, every storyline dull. I no longer care if the character I&#8217;m guiding falls endlessly, screen after screen to his death. I&#8217;m more aggravated by difficult or unresponsive control schemes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really excited to pick up a controller right now.</p>
<p>This will change, of course. It&#8217;s actually a side effect of the depth of immersion possible with some video games today. Part of the pleasure of a game like a good <em>Final Fantasy</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> is becoming invested in an entire world, getting to know the characters, overcoming challenges, and taking part in an experience that builds as it goes along. I&#8217;ve written in the past about the substantial learning curve of contemporary games, where much of the early portions of the game are devoted to tutorials, but there&#8217;s a learning curve involved in an immersive story as well. It takes time, in effect, for a game to earn its player&#8217;s trust and build a relationship.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why sequels are pervasive in the video game world. It&#8217;s smart business for a developer to make the most of an audience that a game has already built, but the economics make sense on the player&#8217;s side as well. You&#8217;re already invested in the game&#8217;s world, and you have a pretty good idea what you&#8217;re going to get out of the experience. Playing a new game is like a first date. You&#8217;re interested but tentative. Something about the game is attractive, and you want to get to know it better. Most of the time, you&#8217;ve even shelled out a dinner-worthy $20-60, but you&#8217;re still figuring out whether the game is worth a more substantial, long-term relationship.</p>
<p>And sometimes you go on a lot of first dates before you get a second date.</p>
<p>(You may laugh, but I played <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> for four months. I&#8217;ve only dated two people longer than that, and I married one of them.)</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going on first dates right now. I&#8217;m taking the opportunity to get better acquainted with some exciting, attractive games that I couldn&#8217;t pursue because I was spending time with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. I&#8217;m taking a new look at some old friends to see if there&#8217;s the possibility of discovering something more. It&#8217;s fun, but it takes a lot of energy. There are disappointments. Sometimes it&#8217;s the game. Sometimes it&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get there. And I&#8217;ll let you know when I do.</p>
