										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Winter of 2004, at the behest of our store’s promotions coordinator I participated in my first radio show. In Lansing there is a local city newspaper named <a href="http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/" target="_blank">City Pulse</a>, founded and edited by a fellow named Berl Schwartz. I was asked to call in on a Saturday morning to comment on something, in fact, one of my employees was also asked to participate in the show. I will always remember him calling his Mom to tell her. I can’t remember what the topic was now all these years later. I called in, lying in bed at my apartment on Lake Lansing Road. It felt natural,(the talking, not the lying in bed) talking about this and that. He asked me a question about music, I responded. We jawed a bit and when asked about one more thing, I brought up the new CD of music by local actor Jeff Daniels. My ease contrasted nicely with my employee, who was stilted and frankly bricked when asked about a certain film. Hey, maybe he was nervous. With the show over I was told the next Tuesday that I had impressed Berl and found myself invited onto the City Pulse’s hourly slot on WDBM 88.9, the monolithic MSU campus radio station. I jumped at the chance but bricked myself by bringing in Christmas music as opposed to music for the busy Christmas season. No matter. I remember having fun and feeling natural, feelings that were lacking on my next appearance on the show in Spring 2005.</p>
<p>Summer of 2005 showed up and I moved north, returning to the city I had called home from 1978-1984 while returning to the life of college, heading towards the degree that I now have in a cardboard sleeve under my desk. As I signed up and started taking classes one thought stayed first in my mind: How was I going to be able to keep getting free CDs? One of the true treats of working in a music store is the promotional disc, essentially a free copy of a commercially released CD that you as employees would play in the store to drum up interest. The promo is the true lost commodity in the digital world we inhabit now. You can’t sell your MP3s when you are starving and need money for food or if you need to clean out your shelves and realize that since you spent nothing on the promo it is essentially free money. Hell, I used to tip the pizza guy with 3 promos figuring he could get anywhere from 9-5 dollars by selling the discs. My one insider connection, at EMI, had already sent me a final thank you package of Rudy Van Gelder promos, 12 total. I scrambled my brain thinking of ways to get more, or at least keep it coming. I found a way: WNMC 90.7 FM.</p>
<p>Before I moved to Traverse City, my girlfriend would often tell me of a local station pointed out to her by a former co-worker who had moved north to be with her wine-making husband. Whenever I drive north on a Sunday, the first things I will always remember are arriving at her door, opening it and walking up the stairs to the top half of the house she lived on. I would smell incense, smell the apartment, and hear WNMC on the dial. I have strong memories of visiting and listening to the station upon arriving in TC on a Sunday. I’ll write about the shows on the station in the coming weeks, for now I’ll focus on the fact that there was a radio station on campus. I hopped onto their website and found the form for volunteering. My plan was to offer to write reviews for the website, thus keeping my connections fresh and creating a need for me to ask for promos. Can’t review what you can’t hear, after all! What happened instead caught me off guard, I was called and asked about DJ-ing a show. I scheduled my first training and nervously wandered into West Hall on a Thursday to sit and watch a DJ handle the board and deliver his show. I’ll never forget it. Second training was spent talking with Blind Dog Sandy, a heckuva fellow. Great times just jawing. Third training I hosted the show for an hour, live. I was scared in my boots during that hour, but I did it. And within a few weeks I was on the air, live, three hours a week, every other Tuesday. I hosted the Afternoon Jazz block on the station and I would go on to host the show in one form or fashion on one day or another for the next four years. I didn’t let my presence on the air stop simply with Jazz, no, I would host anything, any opportunity to get on the air and spin tunes and have fun. I hosted the Afternoon Jazz show and, for a time, the Morning Show that broadcast from 6am-8am. I would occasionally host the free-form Friday night show, playing three hours of nothing but the music I brought from home, an ultimate mix tape for the town. When our son was born, the GM allowed me to bring him into the studio. </p>
<p>Every Wednesday around 1pm I would bundle Jack up, snap him into the giant blue stroller I called the Blue Meanie, and walk the half a mile to the station. Once there I would DJ, interact with my son while he was awake, and spin tunes. Generally he would nap when I was on the air but I always noted his presence in the show. One time a gentleman caller phoned me to complain about me talking about or to Jack. I almost quit. I remember Eric, the GM, calling me up out of the blue the day after Thanksgiving to see how I was doing &#8212; I was that upset about the caller. Bob, our esteemed folk director and program director at the station was the next caller that day and when I told him that someone had complained he was succinct, “Aww the hell with him!” This was the sense of comraderie that made the station so much fun for me and such a valuable asset in my transition in life.</p>
<p>When Jack got too big to bring in, I jiggled my schedule and started hosting the Mid-Day Jazz show from 11-2pm on Mondays. This was the last consistent show that I hosted on WNMC and while my shows were different after Jack left my side in the booth, I still enjoyed it. </p>
<p>More than anything what I loved about the station, and what I continue to miss, was the sense of community. I’ve always had work friends, they can be easier to pick up and forget than real friends. Work friends have always fulfilled that part of me that needs to be social, a part of me that needs to interact, the part of me that people like.  What made this better was I felt as if the audience I drew were all my work friends. I was, basically, talking. Into the void if you will. I knew the radio waves were sending the signal out as far south at Cadillac and as far north as Petosky. I knew there were ears out there, invisible, listening to me yap. If you have the misfortune of knowing me you know that I am longwinded. Not ready to call myself a blowhard, nor a raconteur. I talk. And I can talk quite a bit. My shows were three hours long and I didn’t talk for three hours, but I had the information in my head ready at a moment’s notice to talk about the artists I was playing. I spent 30 minutes on Sunday playing and talking about Hank Mobley, the legendary tenor.  All the retail learning, all the selling, allowed me to talk about this music in a very natural manner. Sure I tried to be funny, to make jokes, sometimes I cracked myself up. But I always felt completely comfortable talking about any music we were playing. Some Jazz artists, some artists I love and cherish, I could talk and talk about. Others made me draw comparisons. No matter I was ready to talk and all these facts in my head, all this useless shit I remember and never forget, was at the tip of my tongue and ready to roll.</p>
<p>Being a fan is essential in any aspect of music, but especially if you are a DJ. The one critical thing I would teach trainees when it was their third hour on training, when the manned the board for an hour, was start with something you know and love. Take that music, play it, maybe play two songs, and when it comes time for that first break when your heart is pounding and all you hear on the cans is the spit in your dry mouth and how high your voice sounds, simply talk about what you played and what it means to you. This familiarity breeds the comfort you need to not think about speaking in front of a large audience of undetermined size. A local jazz singer did a third traning, she was off to study at Berklee in Boston that fall. You could hear the nerves in her voice. And this was a performer! And also a feature I loved about the station was the quality of off-air converstarion. The GM is one of the smartest dudes I’ve met, able to talk about anything in an interesting, cogent manner. Normally this is what killed the second hour of my Monday shows: Eric would be sitting in the booth doing something and a question would pop into my head and I would bring it up.</p>
<p>“When was the biggest West Indian/Jamaican emigration to London/England? Was it the 50s?”</p>
<p>“My sister loves Russian History. She has the Gulag Arpiellego but is looking for post-Czarist Russian stuff”</p>
<p>“What was Ethel Merman’s biggest hit?” (This one I actually posed on air and got some pretty interesting comments.)</p>
<p>My last show actually took place on a Friday, hosting Eric’s 11am-2pm slot. I played favorites and reminisced about my time on the station. As 2pm drew near I wasn’t emotional but caught up in the silliness around me. I joked with people off-air, I made fun of myself, and I told the listeners that I always planned on leaving in one of two ways. </p>
<p>The first was to just FREAK OUT on air! Figuring I do live in town and need to work here I chose the second, playing the song &#8220;Farwell&#8221; by Lawrence Welk. I thought it summed me up.  The following Monday I was going to start student teaching, a five day a week commitment. I couldn’t host a regular show anymore. Not only that but the addition of my daughter, not even two months old when I left the station, made any daytime shifts nigh on impossible to host. </p>
<p>This is not to say that I’ve vanished from the station. Every April 29th (or thereabouts) I have been allowed to host a three hour long tribute show to the music of Duke Ellington in the honor of his birthday and, as it happens, my son’s birthday. And from time to time the great Ben Hamper calls me and I pinch-hit on Soul Possession, the funkiest show in Northern Michigan. I still feel a part of the WNMC family, I still jaw jack with the crew that I really like whenever I stop by the station. And I still help out during the fundraisers, lending my tones to the airwaves in an attempt to get people to PAY to stop me from talking. </p>
<p>Terrestrial radio as we know it is dying, like so many other mediums that gave so many of us color and imagination. I’ve worked in record stores, bookstores, and radio stations. Now they feel obsolete. But these places are only as obsolete as we make them. WNMC is a quality station, run by people who volunteer to discuss their passion. A friend of mine called DJing making your advocation your vocation. I think that is true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first round of the State Farm Home Run Derby lasted two hours. Despite running 3 miles in the gross humidity just before it started, I decided to tweet it &#8212; I toweled off first.</p>
<p>Between my own disgusting scent and the presence of the vile Chris Berman (on television &#8212; not in my home), I was a little cranky. Not Joe Buck is on cranky, but close.</p>
<p>A selection of tweets, below. You can go check <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/motheroflight" target="_blank">my Twitter feed</a> for everything &#8212; including the duds I edited out to make it appear that I am a 1.000 hitter when it comes to the funny. Instead of, you know, .500.</p>

Husband wants to see a pitcher&#8217;s home run derby. I bet Cliff Lee would win that, too, unless Mike Hampton un-retired.  </p>

Ok, it&#8217;s a plaid jacket, striped shirt and candy cane tie. If Berman&#8217;s personality matched his clothing&#8230;I would still wanna hit him.</p>

Do you think Cano&#8217;s dad is really giving Papi good stuff to hit? Gotta be honest &#8212; if my kid was in it, too, I&#8217;d throw junk.  </p>

<p>And, yeah, we get that far less than zero percent of all advertising or promotional marketing is aimed at us. </p>
<p>Which is fine. I don&#8217;t need a pink Detroit Tigers cap, or a pink baseball shaped keychain, or a pink whatever &#8212; even though I really do like the color pink and its various incarnations. </p>

The hero, a football-loving man (the audience is always assumed to be male), is so oppressed by his wife&#8217;s relentless nagging that we (more men) are meant to empathize with him and root for him when he, say, leaves his wife off the guest list for the party in their home.</p>
<p>Oh, and the home is now full of hot bitches drinking some frosty beer, natch. </p>
<p>Fine. Maybe most male sports fans aren&#8217;t &#8220;fan&#8221; enough to watch an entire telecast without the requisite tit shots to hold their attention. Or perhaps Coors really does get a huge bump in sales from men watching these games and living under such horrific matriarchal regimes &#8212; who knows.</p>
<p>What I do know is that, when my friends (ladies) and I watch sports, we somehow manage to make it through the entire event without some scrotal cleavage being dangled along the sidelines to keep us too transfixed to turn away. </p>
<p>Yet I cannot attend or watch any major sporting event (save international soccer) without having some half-naked woman tossed out and bobbed along the sidelines like a lure on a fishing line. The USC sweater girls? The endless NCAA tourney upskirts? The barely-contained silicon juggernauts of Tampa Bay and Dallas, ass hanging out from booty shorts? Even hockey has them &#8212; the ladies in (what else?) booty shorts and midriff-baring mini-team-tanks scooping up piles of ice shavings.</p>

<p>And what do we get? Well, we get no reprieve. We get the same sweaty ass of the nose tackle, his jock strap clearly visible through his soaked white pants. We get David Beckham puking. We get men at their sweatiest, and most disgusting. Sometimes, if we&#8217;re lucky, they&#8217;ll have interesting facial hair or spectacular muscles.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be honest here: women do not watch sports for the eye candy. Perhaps men don&#8217;t, either, but they get the eye candy as a bizarre reward for watching something they should be fan enough to watch anyway. </p>
<p>My point being: it was bad enough before.</p>
<p>Now, we have this. </p>

<p>Now, every broadcast of Tigers games on Fox Sports Detroit &#8212; which otherwise does a fair job of avoiding the &#8220;now watch this jiggle&#8221; sports marketing trend &#8212; features these women, either in the stands or in some thirty-second vignette delivering a stilted, generic monologue about baseball. &#8220;I still remember my first game.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. I exaggerate, but you get the point. If the essay question were, tell me about a cherished memory, and that were your answer, you&#8217;d fail. And that&#8217;s what this whole bullshit campaign is: a fail.</p>
<p>First, it completely insults any fan &#8212; male, female, gay or straight &#8212; who watches baseball just because they like baseball. It&#8217;s the equivalent of your boss giving you a gold star for showing up to work and speaking to you like a kindergartner. It&#8217;s like being spoken to as if you were a puppy: &#8220;Aw, there&#8217;s a good boy! You stayed with us after the commercial break. Now watch me smile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, it adds nothing to the game. There&#8217;s a big difference between Erin Andrews &#8212; who is insanely hot but also a fucking good journalist with stellar credentials who actually worked her way up &#8212; and these two, &#8220;Lauren&#8221; and &#8220;Allison,&#8221; whose only qualifications for the &#8220;job&#8221; seem to be being attractive, photogenic, and craving attention from somewhat famous dudes. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re worse than cheerleaders, who have athletic talent and are victims of creepy cameramen and gross color commentators. They&#8217;re worse than the hockey girls, who, scantily clad and overly made-up though they are, still perform the valuable service of cleaning the ice. </p>
<p>This? This is pandering. This is insulting. It&#8217;s John McCain choosing Sarah Palin. It&#8217;s the slow-motion running sequences of Pam Anderson on Baywatch. It&#8217;s the worst of every other sport, made more ludicrous. </p>
<p>This is baseball, assholes. And I prefer mine without the barely-concealed message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Texieria is a good defensive third basemen. He has won a gold glove. . . mainly because of his offense.<br />
&mdash;Rod Allen, Tigers color commentator</p></blockquote>
<p>You know how I feel about sub-par broadcasters like <a href="http://storify.com/motheroflight/a-night-without-winning">Joe Buck</a>. </p>
<p>But perhaps my harsh review of Buck&#8217;s lack-of-excitement cliché-ridden brand of sport-calling is partly due to having had a fairly good run of it so far.</p>
<p>I mean, I grew up listening to Ernie Harwell. Now I can tune in a game on the radio and hear Dan Dickerson and Jim Price, Dickerson always taking the time to sketch in the crosshatchings of details fans like me love: the posture of a player at the plate, where he holds his hands, what he does between pitches. </p>
<p>Sometimes, while I&#8217;m listening to the game and digging vaguely carrot-scented, insidious and impossible to fully eradicate tuberous tendrils from what will become my moonflower beds out back, I practice my own play-by-play. I think of Alex Avila coming to the plate, his front shoulder turned toward the catcher, the way he begins his stance already coiled, as though he&#8217;s trying to get a head start, adopting a hunch to his back that&#8217;s a bit like the big Turkish boxer on <em>Mike Tyson&#8217;s Punch-Out</em>.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be real. I&#8217;m less the serene, jovial Dan Dickerson than the bizarre, hilarious and downright individual Rod Allen. Allen&#8217;s claim to fame involves playing 15 games for the 1984 Tigers and irately chasing another player around the field in an attempt to consummate a fight&mdash;I&#8217;ll pause while you watch the video on YouTube. (Try to find <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MLkIwnQIw4">the version with the circus music soundtrack</a>. It really ties the room together.)</p>
<p>To put it simply, Rod Allen has fun watching the game and passes that on the viewer&mdash;he almost bursts through the screen to nudge you there on the couch and giggle at the sight of Magglio Ordonoz rounding first wearing what Rod calls his &#8220;Mr. T starter kit,&#8221; a clutch of chains and oversized pendants.</p>
<p>That usually gets a chuckle from Mario Impemba, the homegrown play-by-play announcer who remembers Chet Lemon as Chet The Jet because he grew up loving the Bless You Boys, too. Rod&#8217;s rapport with Mario, and his talent for bringing that same <em>joie de baseball</em> out in Impemba, is just one of his incredible qualities.</p>
<p>Instead of adopting the stuffy, pedantic and condescending carriage of a Joe Morgan or the cliché-ridden idiocy of so many former players who mistake repeating the same small point <em>ad infinitum</em> for actual insight into the game, Rod Allen reduces the game down to all the components that made many of us fall in love with baseball.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s just as awed by powerful, epic-seeming players like Miguel Cabrera as I am. I was so struck by his call of a 2009 Cabrera homerun&mdash;&#8221;Big Daddy just leaned on one!&#8221;&mdash;that I wrote it into a poem for my husband at our wedding. (I should note that he nixed my first idea, which was to write our vows in a sort of Rod – Mario banter.)</p>
<p>As a poet, I am taken by his reworking and reinvention of language. Allen&#8217;s pitchers don&#8217;t throw change-ups or sliders, they hurl a slide piece or a change piece. </p>
<p>When the Tigers are staring down a hefty deficit or a daunting schedule, it&#8217;s &#8220;tough sledding,&#8221; which is such an unexpected linguistic turn because it&#8217;s both out of season and entirely removed from the traditional catalogue of sports metaphors. </p>
<p>And unlike the aforementioned Buck (ugggh), Rod is not afraid to be a fan. My husband and I happened to be at Armando Galaragga&#8217;s perfect game, and the moment that lingers in my mind is now overwritten with Allen&#8217;s call: rookie Austin Jackson making an insane running catch in the ninth to preserve perfection. I watched the replay so many times that even now, recalling it from our seats along the third baseline and standing on my toes to see what I was sure would be a drop, I can hear Allen&#8217;s triumphant, <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I57qFzaJGgc">&#8220;OH, JACKSON!&#8221;</a> as Austin hauls the ball in.</p>
<p>As though I heard the call during the live game, which was, of course, impossible. </p>
<p>For as much as Allen celebrates the game, he&#8217;s not at all afraid to poke at some of the less venerable aspects of the sport, such as the charade of awards like the Gold Glove (see his sly takedown of Texieria&#8217;s award).   </p>
<p>But for all of it, Rod Allen is a silly fan like the rest of us. Like my brother and I inventing nicknames for our favorite players, like my brother and his best friend always commenting on Brandon Inge&#8217;s perplexing facial hair or remarking on the lack of speed of certain base runners. </p>
<p>Really, the unbridled joy of Rod Allen is he could just as easily be the guy next to you at the bar with the running commentary of the game&mdash;a guy you want to sit next to all summer long because he&#8217;s not Joe Morgan.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a guy who calls Brennan Boesch &#8220;country strong&#8221; and Verlander &#8220;filthy.&#8221; He&#8217;s the anti-Joe Buck, and that&#8217;s just my kind of pal.</p>
