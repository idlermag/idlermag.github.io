										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You had to know it was coming. Jimmy Fallon hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em> the WEEK before Christmas? You had to know that the show, at some point, would feature the wacky little ditty &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas.&#8221; Many years ago the number, written by Fallon and Horatio Sanz, was premiered before the 30 Rock crowd. The original has become a classic in the realm of silly little <em>SNL</em> memories. <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/18/i-wish-it-was-christmas/">The version we linked to on this site last year</a> was NOT <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/HORATIOS-CHRISTMAS-TREAT/1185577" target="_blank">the original</a> but a different version. I remember seeing one in a warm month, or at least a spring month, clamoring for the season to arrive.  And so as I watched <em>Saturday Night Live</em> I waited and was rewarded with the 2011 version of that very first sketch. All four players were there from the original: Sanz, Fallon, Chris Kattan (looking waxy), and Tracy Morgan. They played the song, Morgan did his dance, Kattan whipped his head and almost dropped the keyboard, the audience reacted to the sketch as a classic. And it is, the song is a classic, but the version from last week was not THE version. No, there is another version, a version that I have written about before, a version that rests on top of the mountain of Christmas music.</p>
<div class="embed-hulu"><iframe width="640" height="370" src="http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=ur_W8VQ7xcVmtgY0BBJX9A" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen> </iframe></div>
<p>Ever since taking over the slot vacated by Conan O’Brien, Fallon has been creating a fun, funny, and crafty late night show. His show feels young and fun, something that always seem to brew at 12:30 at night on NBC. The irreverence is grounded by a likeability that you really sense when you see him on TV or on these commercials. The show is fun and he seems dedicated to Christmas and the season. Surf over to Hulu and keyword search Fallon and Christmas. 12 Days of Christmas Sweaters, Drunk for Christmas, etc. The man loves the season. Two year ago I happened upon the show and hear the sound of Don Pardo (or a sound alike) introducing a gift from Late Night. Out came Fallon and Horatio Sanz, in matching sweaters, and began to play the song. One minute in the song builds, the band takes off and Julian Casablancas takes over, all the elements creating an environment of pure enthusiasm and pure happy energy. The song, in reality, isn’t much lyrically, but it magically transforms into something greater in this setting. Casablancas had released a recorded version of the song in conjunction with his solo debut, this version kills his first version.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wS-k66MKgs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Last year I wrote about the song, about the way it makes me feel and the way it makes me feel whenever I hear this version with Fallon &amp; Sanz &amp; Casablancas. It combines the gentle majesty of the season with the enthusiasm of the participants and the absolute enjoyment of the crowd. As the time has passed since last year I think this song, this version, is the greatest Christmas song of all time. Why? It is the most modern, for one. Sure everyone puts out a disc of Holiday tunes for the season, these are more likely than not a collection of classics with a new spin. The majority of traditional Christmas songs were modern in the 40s and 50s, when the season was probably incredibly magical and paced well. Think of Michael Corleone shopping and finding out about his father in the first Godfather film. To me, that is the feeling of Christmas that those songs reflect. The rush that captivates and motivates us all nowadays ruins what should be a nice, reflective time of year. Some Christmas music is timeless, the <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/25/1-christmas-music/">Charlie Brown Christmas LP</a> is one of the greatest complete set of Christmas music you could ever hope to have. Soft, brilliant, cheerful, devotional, yet completely engaging. That disc sounds like snow on the ground, the first snow you see, no footprints, not even from squirrels or other animals. Pure, white fields of joy under a beautiful cold blue sky.</p>
<p>The Fallon song is modern and yet it says nothing of the modern lives we lead and the crush of desire many feel at the holidays. It alerts that the season is simple and joyous and within reach whenever we need to feel simple and joyous. It is not materialistic it is excited and eager and within those emotions we too can remember those feeling and emotions.</p>
<p>I am a parent now; I have two small (in terms of age) children. I want their memories to Christmas to be driven by snow, stars, lights, and a rush of good cheer that will last until the kids are the age I find myself. The holiday season is brief, it can be rough, and events that transpire at this time of year, good or bad, will remain with you for your remaining days.  Remember that life, while bleak in points, is beautiful. Really it is. You don’t know how many more sunrises you will see, nor how many more Christmastimes. Allow yourself the chance to slow down and appreciate what makes the Holiday season magical for you now and for you when. And never forget those feelings.</p>
<p>Here is my War Against Chrismas Music mix for 2011. It ends, as last year’s ended, on Jimmy Fallon’s &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas Today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="new" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/117205/saturday-night-live-i-wish-it-was-christmas-today">The original clip</a> is slightly hard to miss&mdash;four men dressed in matching sweaters, singing and playing a little ditty about Christmas. It was on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in the 90s. The actors were Jimmy Fallon, Horatio Sanz, Tracy Morgan, and Chris Kattan. The song was titled &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas Today.&#8221; You sorta can’t miss it anymore during the season, what with the themed holiday recaps of <em>SNL</em>.  I think they even dropped it in the late spring once, just out of the blue. It was strange and silly and it worked.</p>
<p>In 2009 four days before Christmas I saw a clip from Jimmy Fallon’s <em>Late Night</em> show.  I find Fallon funny. I enjoy his energy and his humor. So when I heard that the sketch was <a target="new" href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/julian-casablancas-i-wish-it-was-christmas-today-122109/1187848/">“a holiday message from <em>Late Night</em>”</a> I sorta knew where it was going. At least I thought I did.</p>
<p>There was Horatio Sanz, sans a hundred pounds, singing the song with Fallon in matching red sweaters. It was a nice update. Then the something happened. The camera panned to the right and there was the lead singer of The Strokes, Julian Casablancas, singing the song! A few things happened next.</p>
<ol>
<li>I remembered how GREAT the Strokes debut was and how much I hated it when I first got it.</li>
<li>I fell head over heels in love with the song and its energy, particularly near the end when Fallon and Sanz joined Casablancas to finish the track.</li>

The sounds of the end of the song match the looks on the faces of Fallon, Sanz, and Casablancas. They’re having fun. They’re laughing. They’re happy. The joy and energy on their faces, in the music, it is the sound of youth, the sound of the happiness and excitement present in the holiday season when you are a child. I can’t tell you how often I listened to the version from the show over the next four days.</p>
<p>I kept coming back to the emotions, the happiness in the sounds and in the look (download the MP3 from the show, it is much more alive than the studio version: you hear the crowd, you hear The Roots, and you hear those smiles and the energy they bring) from the show. You almost have to see the clip to really have it burn into your brain. When Sanz and Fallon are sharing the mic with Casablancas and the way they are into the music, the moment and the performance are great. They way they ape Casblancas’ singing style is also super great. But you have to SEE the looks on their faces as their excitement in the performance really made me think of the excitement and energy that you have as a child in the lead up to Christmas and in the ultimate arrival of the day itself.</p>
<p>I remember the magic of going to bed and then waking up, stone cold awake in bed at 4am on Christmas morning. Creeping downstairs and flipping on the light switch that always triggered the tree lights. Where there were empty spaces in the morning now were full of gifts, And then you just had to wait for your parents to wake up so you could tear the wrapping off the boxes. The anticipation grew until one of your parents finally felt the energy in the house and go up to oversee the scrum. It was great, it was one of the best moments of the year.</p>
<p>I hear those emotions in the song, in the performance from the show with the whole band and with the principal writers of the song. You feel that excitement and it brings you back to being a kid, to those feeling and smiles. It is happiness in song form.  I cannot listen to the song without breaking into a smile, and when by chance the song pops up in my iTunes throughout the year it conjures the same emotions. Rather than flip right through the track I stop and listen to it. And goddamn if I don’t get excited for Christmas in doing so.</p>
