										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wonder what is like being from another country. This sounds sort of stupid, but Americans often have a strange, warped view of the music of other countries. It is not unexpected to have a country-specific oritentation towards your own pop culture. We are the center of our experience and of our own perspective. In music, we are aware of the music originating in other countries, but it ebbs and flows. In the 90s the pendulum was the alt.rock movement coming from Seattle and other spots. Then the pendulum swung towards the UK with Oasis and Britpop. But what would the 90s have been like in other countries? Just how dominant is the American music scene in other countries? How did the music coming from the USA play in these countries during musical boom times and musical bust times? What happens when the pendulum swings in the opposite direction?</p>
<p>England may not the best example, since the UK has produced so much of our popular music in the past 50 years. Let’s think about other English-speaking countries like Canada and Australia. Have you ever tried to watch the Juno awards on CBC and felt that even without a language barrier that you may as well have been watching a program on how to learn Morse code? A quick trawl through the record books shows an unmatched FIVE YEAR WINNING STREAK FOR BRYAN ADAMS. On the female side, Anne Murray and Celine Dion have four-year streaks. The Tragically Hip, a quintessentially Canadian band, have won multiple Juno awards. </p>
<p>The Aria awards, from Australia, can feel equally as disjointed. The Hall of Fame class of 2011 consisted of Kylie Minogue and the Wiggles. Yes. The Wiggles, torturers of parents for over a decade. Yet a swirl through the award winners does not always yield a wacky result. For in 1998 the Aria Album of the Year was <em>Unit</em> by the Brisbane band, Regurgitator. Never heard of them? Of course not! But I have, and let me tell you, they’re great.</p>
<p>In 1998 I spent some time participating in an overseas study program through Michigan State University. I spent time in Australia, folks, Sydney and Canberra to be more precise. Now you would not know this from looking at me but I LOVE Australia and have for thirty years. (Is that possible? When did I first learn of Australia? Let’s see. . . Superman 2 on HBO, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor wanting beachfront property, globe spins to. . . Australi. New Year&#8217;s Day 1982. Yep, thirty years) Once I got over my initial cowardice and signed up for the program, I departed from Detroit in early January of 1998.</p>

The HMV store I lived at in Sydney had the CD on display, a silver cover with a great yellow circle on the front. Yet I didn’t buy it. When our group arrived in Canberra I remember talking with an Australian girl about the band, “the Gurge” she called them. I was really trying to chat her up when my attention was distracted by a ditz with big brown eyes (look it up) and when I turned around the Aussie was gone. But her words on the band stuck with me. I bought a Rolling Stone with the band on the cover and read up on them before really digging into their catalog. It took my return to the states before I got a chance to buy <em>Unit</em>. Actually, I came into work one day and there was in my locker. I had no idea my manager ordered it for me from the import sheets, and it was such a wonderful shock. I bought the disc and took it home to listen to it.</p>
<p>The disc opens with the song, “I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff.” You need to know the first LP, <em>Tu Plang</em>, to understand that opening song. On their first CD the band is very rockish, muscular and melodic, with lots of crash and <em>sturm und drang</em>. The humor is evident (&#8220;I Sucked A Lot of Cock To Get Where I Am&#8221;) as are the band’s interest in different sounds (&#8220;G7 Dick Electric Boogie&#8221;). Hearing those songs and then this first song, you come to an understanding that the band is branching into a new direction, one that may not be well received. But then on &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; the band is just a ripping motor of super fast, super fun music. Two songs in and <em>Unit</em> is only about 6 minutes long and just tons of fun. Then you get to the third song, called “! (The Song Formerly Known As)&#8221; which is a killer. Sort of like a hybrid Prince song, catchy and rocking and vibrant. In these songs you hear the sounds that were being planted on that first disc and watching them bloom is very exciting. The disc was strong in 1998 and while it isn’t quite as strong in 2012, the tracks that stood out still stand out. &#8220;Bubble Boy&#8221; is the second greatest song about an inflatable sex doll, only trailing Roxy Music’s &#8220;In Every Dream Home A Heartache&#8221; on that sparsely inhabited trail.</p>
<p>The not-yet-extinct music video helped the band with their image and the videos from the <em>Unit</em> LP are as strong as the songs. &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; acts out the plot to <em>Tron</em>, while “!” shows the band standing around in Japanese crowds.  Other videos are computer animated and silly and disposable but somehow entertaining and engaging as well.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9270" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/23/regurgitated/art1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Art1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=640" alt=". . . Art" title="Art1"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-9270" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> There are a few themes that pop up on <em>Unit</em> that make their way into Regurgitator’s follow-up CD, <em>. . . Art</em>, most notably a sense of disconnection from humanity and the embrace of technology as a substitute for traditional human interaction. These themes are sometimes subtle, sometimes not. Even on their poppiest of songs, and man oh man does <em>. . . Art</em> have some poppy songs, there is a bittersweet underpinning to every lyric. On &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; from <em>Unit</em>, Quan Yeomans sings “everyday I talk to my machines/more sense than talking with human beings.” This disconnect, the withdrawal into the virtual doesn’t sound too far-fetched today but in 1998 could it have seemed real? The last song on <em>. . . Art</em> is titled &#8220;Virtual Life&#8221; and the words are about needing everything from the TV screen and needing nothing else from a regular life. As a man who spends too much time on Facebook, this song feels prophetic. We surrender so much of ourselves to exist online.</p>
<p>When I was in Australia I noticed a sign in the classrooms on my second day in the country: a sign beckoning students to turn off their cell phones. Back home, cell phones were car phones and were the size of a foot. They weren’t everywhere and they certainly weren’t “your phone.” In some ways it feels strange that one of the most removed continents, hell, THE most removed continent on the globe would be so quick to adapt to new technology. At the same time, with that early adaption, perhaps that is where the burnout so aptly described on these songs originates. In the late 90s there was so much of an undercurrent of chatter speaking to “pre-millennium tension” but without any substance or understanding of where that tension originated from. Here, in Australia, was a band that was singing out about a different type of tension between technology and human connection, which has grown and overgrown the globe in the 14 years since the words were put to tape.</p>
<p>When I listen to <em>Unit</em> and <em>. . . Art</em>, I am magically whisked away from here to another land and another time. As with any nostalgia, some of the memories hold up, some don’t. The tracks on these two LPs, however, hold up in all their poppy greatness. I see that the band continues to record and release music. I’m glad for that as we are all better off with a band like Regurgitator in the world. Humor, discontent, observation and melody. What more do you need?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 370px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="David Gulpilil" src="https://i2.wp.com/img.yaboon.com/person/frame/43142/2.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="253" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Watch out, he'll track yo' ass</p></div>
<p>Australia is not really known as a hub of great film, for the most part. There have been some great ones, though, like <em>Rabbit Proof Fence </em>(2002), in which three aboriginal sisters escape a school training them as domestic staff, intending to return to their mother. They are tracked by another aboriginal named Moodoo, played by David Gulpilil, who also appears as a tracker in another great Aussie film, <em>The Proposition</em> (2005), a film I have <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/16/what-fresh-hell-is-this/">mentioned before</a>. He plays a tracker again in the aptly titled, <em>The Tracker</em> (2002), in which he helps some white men locate a native Australian accused of murdering a white woman.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Before you start to think that David Gulpilil plays a tracker in <em>every</em> Australian film, I will move on to the two Aussie films that recently caught my attention: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1530983/"><em>Red Hill</em> </a>(2010) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1085507/"><em>The Square</em> </a>(2008), not so much for their quality (both films are good, one a bit better than the other), but for their respective approaches to their genres.</p>
<p><em>Red Hill</em> sounded like the kind of film I am intrinsically drawn to. It is a western, first and foremost, but critics had boasted noir, surreal and even horror film influences as well. Quality genre-mashing is a weakness of mine. Its story involves Officer Shane Cooper (Ryan Kwanten) being assigned to the small town of Red Hill after being shot on duty. The local police department reacts to his presence with equal parts disdain and disinterest. The Sheriff’s name is Old Bill (Steve Bisley), and that tells you as much as you need to know about him.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Red Hill poster" src="https://mygeekblasphemy.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/red-hill-movie-2010.jpg?w=221&#038;h=318" alt="" width="221" height="318" />At the beginning of the film there is a shot of a herd of horses grazing. Their ears perk up at sound of an explosion far off in the distance. It is the sound of murderer Jimmy Conway (Tommy Lewis) escaping the prison Old Bill had put him in years ago. Now, he’s returning to his hometown looking to serve up a dish best served cold.</p>
<p>In traditional, neo-noir fashion we have a small town cop in over his head, working within a system that appears to be corrupt (neither Old Bill nor Jimmy Conway are what they seem) and a mysterious, almost otherworldly villain. The horror element, I suppose, comes from Jimmy’s systematic dispatching of his enemies and seeming invulnerability. If these all sound like fine ideas, it is because they are. The problem is the execution.</p>
<p><em>Red Hill</em> never really goes all-in with its ideas. It never establishes a consistent tone or mood. It felt like a story crying out for more shadow play and more grit, but it’s just too timid. It even fails its primary villain. Jimmy is introduced as an unstoppable, unflinching force of nature, not unlike <em>No Country for Old Men’s</em> Anton Chigurh. But the more we learn of his motives and the more we see him accidentally being bad-ass (Tommy Lewis essentially sleepwalks through the movie, more due to the nature of the role than his acting ability), the less interesting he becomes.  When we finally get down to the nitty-gritty,Conway’s resolution is a bit over-the-top and his final line is absolutely cringe-worthy, evoking a laugh at a moment where empathy is most crucial.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignright" title="The Square poster" src="https://i2.wp.com/twitchfilm.com/news/The%20SquarePoster.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="318" />The Square</em> is a less ambitious, but far more successful film. It doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel. Construction foreman Ray Yale (David Roberts) is having an affair with a younger woman who lives on the wrong side of the river that separates their properties. Her husband is a no good thug who has stowed away a fair amount of moolah in his attic and she reckons things might be better for her and Ray if they could get their hands on it. Now, I ain’t sayin’ she’s a gold digger, but you know the rest.</p>
<p>This film’s been made many times and often successfully. Why watch this when I can watch <em>Double Indemnity</em> (1944)? Or <em>Blood Simple</em> (1984)? Or <em>Out of the Past</em> (1947)? (Wow, femmes fatale have been leading men around by their you-know-what’s for generations, haven’t they?) No real reason, I suppose. Except that sometimes it’s nice to see some fresh faces in a well-executed film that reminds you of other well-executed films. <em>The Square</em> just gets the vibe right.</p>
<p>I admire <em>Red Hill</em> swinging for the fences, but I think I was just in need of a well placed grounder that night. Or maybe it was the fact that <em>The Square</em> featured absolutely zero trackers? Did I mention that Jimmy Conway’s character is a tracker as well? Or that Tommy Lewis also shows up in <em>The Proposition</em>? It seems as though Australia’s a pretty small place, eh? So what’s with all the trackers?</p>
<p>*Side note: In case you hadn’t noticed, <em>Insert sex joke here</em> is, in and of itself, a sex joke.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<em>The Proposition</em> begins with a shootout and it is the last one you’ll see. This is not your typical western and there are greater brutalities than gunplay here. When the shooting stops we are left with Captain Stanley (The great Ray Winstone, who also happens to appear in <em>Sexy Beast</em>, mentioned in my <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/10/the-cinephiles-september-10-2/" target="_blank">previous post</a>) seated at a table across from Charlie Burns (Guy Pierce) and his little brother Mikey, both of whom are members of a notorious Irish gang lead by their eldest brother, Arthur. The gang has been charged with the rape and murder of a young woman named Eliza Hopkins along with her entire family. Captain Stanley informs the brothers that Mrs. Hopkins was with child at the time.

It is Stanley’s belief that Arthur Burns was the real catalyst for this atrocity and so he offers Charlie a deal: Charlie must find and kill Arthur before Christmas Day or they will hang his little brother and then come after him. For Charlie, there is no choice.]]></description>

<p>It is Stanley’s belief that Arthur Burns was the real catalyst for this atrocity and so he offers Charlie a deal: Charlie must find and kill Arthur before Christmas Day or they will hang his little brother and then come after him. For Charlie, there is no choice.</p>

Inside, Martha maintains the home with the kind of meticulous attention produced by willfully ignoring something else. Eliza Hopkins was Martha&#8217;s good friend and, as a stranger in a strange land, perhaps her only one.</p>
<p>Captain Stanley must prove to her that he can make this right. That they can be happy here. That all is not lost.  Meanwhile, Charlie rides.</p>
<p>He visits the graves of the Hopkins family, lingering at Eliza&#8217;s tombstone. He comes across a drunk old man named Jellon Lamb (an excellent John Hurt), who eventually reveals himself to be a bounty hunter:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are white men, sir, not beasts. Oh, he sits up there in those melancholy hills; some say he sleeps in caves like a beast, slumbers deep like the Kraken. The Blacks say that he is a spirit. The Troopers will never catch him. Common force is meaningless, Mr. Murphy, as he squats up there on his impregnable perch. So I wait, Mr. Murphy. I wait.</p></blockquote>
<p>Charlie knows who Lamb is after.  It is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>The two men part. Charlie is attacked and wounded by Aborigines. When he awakes, he discovers that he&#8217;s been rescued by his former gang, including Arthur himself, who has taken to perching on cliff tops and watching the sun rise. Arthur is intelligent, which makes him all the more dangerous, and one gets the impression that his nearly legendary status in this region was probably carefully crafted by none other than himself.</p>
<p>The brothers reunite, and Arthur reveals his skills are not limited to violence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Love. Love is the key. Love and family. For what are night and day, the sun, the moon, the stars without love, and those you love around you? What could be more hollow than to die alone, unloved?</p></blockquote>
<p>Arthur regards Charlie (and the world) from a cold distance.  It is as though he is merely waiting for Charlie to do what he knows must be done.  There is a scene where Arthur has shot Jellon Lamb in the back to defend Charlie.  As Lamb sits dying, he mutters some words from author George Borrow, which Arthur acknowledges before stabbing him in the heart.  Then, he hears the click of Charlie&#8217;s gun.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why can&#8217;t you ever just&#8230; stop me, Charlie?</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in town Captain Stanley has lost his tenuous control.  An example will be made of Mikey Burns by flogging him in the middle of town. 100 lashes.  It will surely kill him. Street justice is better than no justice at all, but Captain Stanley knows what this means. His proposition is null and void, and Arthur will be coming for them.</p>
<p>Soon, the brutality that lies just beyond the Stanley&#8217;s makeshift fence is kicking in their front door. Arthur does not necessarily seek revenge.  He seeks an excuse to unleash his demons on others. And when Charlie finally shoots his brother neither of them is particularly surprised.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not the stomach, Charlie.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Like <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, <em>The Proposition</em> explores humanity in the face of unchecked violence.  No matter how hard Captain Stanley campaigns to &#8220;civilize this land,&#8221; his battle has already been lost. This is never more obvious than when he releases his Aboriginal servant, who says his goodbyes, strolls to the edge of their property and places his shoes by the fence before heading out into the wild.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;How?&#8221; said the sun that melted the ground</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said the river that refused to run</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Where?&#8221; said the thunder without a sound</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said the rider and took up his gun</em></p></blockquote>
