										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finished <em>Cave Story</em> just minutes before I sat down to write this, so the impressions I&#8217;ll be sharing are fresh, but not entirely settled.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I feel like I just blew up a lot of shit. At the end, you have to fight Misery, The Doctor, The Doctor after the red crystal takes over his body, and then the Core after the Doctor, um Red Crystal Doctor, um, a bunch of red bubbles possess the Core AND Misery AND Sue.</p>
<p>Basically, you just shoot a lot.</p>
<p>And, weirdly, it didn&#8217;t feel like the toughest fight of the game. I had a much harder time with the Dragon Sisters on my second trip through the Egg Corridor (after the big collapse). Of course, that&#8217;s not a complaint. I am, in all honesty, ready to be done. I&#8217;m happy with the game, and the experience as a whole, but I&#8217;m ready to move on to something else, too.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot new to say about the narrative &#8212; I think it&#8217;s a compliment to <em>Cave Story</em> that most of the narrative value is embedded throughout the game rather than coming in one big burst at the end. Destroying and escaping from the floating island felt like a culmination rather than a revelation, although there are a few good additional bits if you watch the credits. Sue, for example, gets turned back to a human, but it doesn&#8217;t stick.</p>
<p>The most powerful moment for me was actually the quick flash to <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/06/cave-story-small-but-not-simple/">Curly Brace</a>, still inactive and locked in the core.</p>
<p>In fact, saving Curly Brace is the one thing that could drag me through the game a second time, although I think there&#8217;s a good argument to be made for <em>not</em> going back to save her. While it&#8217;s almost assumed that a good game is one that&#8217;s designed for replay value &#8212; BioWare is famous for this, and actually puts messages on loading screens encouraging the player to start a second playthrough and make different choices &#8212; <em>Heavy Rain</em> director David Cage has stated in interviews that <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/698809/quantic-dreams-david-cage-play-heavy-rain-several-times-kill-the-magic-of-it/">he hopes that players make a single trip through his game</a>.</p>
<p>These competing desires are expressions of different theories of game narrative experience, both, interestingly, hinging on design architectures which attempt to make player choices matter. BioWare is, in effect, saying &#8220;we put a lot in this game, and you owe it to yourself to see the various outcomes your choices can lead to. See how characters react differently, find all the easter eggs, do everything.&#8221; The evidence, in this case, that choices matter comes from experiencing different outcomes, and the implied argument is that if a player is only going to play a game once, then they may as well go buy a game with a more linear, game-directed storyline. (Like maybe <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>. To which I say, &#8220;Touché, BioWare. Touché.&#8221;)</p>
<p><em>Heavy Rain</em>, while seeming to be similarly focused on crating meaningful player choices, actually takes an entirely different approach as to what it means for a choice to matter. Instead of encouraging the player to go back and find out what could have happened differently, the game instead focuses on creating a more seamless experience.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> In fact, without a second playthrough (or some digging online), it&#8217;s not entirely clear at the end of the game what exactly could or should have gone differently, and one of the things I admire about the game is the way that players who reach wildly different endings can leave the game with the impression that they achieved the &#8220;best&#8221; ending.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, while part of me wants to save Curly Brace, her loss was the most affecting narrative moment in <em>Cave Story</em> for me, and I&#8217;m not totally sure I want to defeat that.</p>
<p>So what do you say, Daniel and Kevin? Will you be playing again? Or was the first trip enough (or more than enough)?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a name="note1"></a>1. I use the phrase &#8220;more seamless&#8221; rather than &#8220;seamless&#8221; intentionally. There&#8217;s a whole column (at least) in <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s seams and joins, but I&#8217;m supposed to be talking about <em>Cave Story</em>, so I&#8217;ll leave it there for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a sojourner in a strange land. I started alone, climbing a sand dune to catch my first glimpse of a mountain with a brilliant light glowing at its peak. As I walked toward the mountain, I encountered a glowing mark which wrapped itself around my neck and gave me the ability to float through the air. I found living scraps of fabric which carried me to a platform where I closed my eyes and saw a figure in white.</p>
<p>That figure would return as I moved forward to show me the story of the world and the people who came before me.</p>
<p>There is a balance every narrative game has to find between what the game gives you, and what it leaves for you to find. My first trip through the game was carried almost entirely by what was given. There was the experience of the world as I traveled through it, and there was the story of the world as revealed in the visions/cutscenes between levels. Every vision showed a little bit of where I had been, a little bit of where I was to go next, and a little bit of what had happened. It&#8217;s brilliantly difficult to be more specific than that, as the visions are images entirely free of text.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on writing. The visions are iconographic &#8212; the graphemes it uses are representations of embodiment and embodied action, and like all representation, it operates by demanding interpretation. The revealed story &#8212; the story communicated through the visions &#8212; is perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous. Life, living cloth, both flora and fauna, emanate from the energy of the mountain. People begin to direct energy, first into greater cloths, and then into structures which use cloths as energy sources. The people attain great heights, and then the energy starts to flicker. There is a tearing of the cloth. New, terrible machines are built under storm and cloud. The world is covered in sand. A single traveler appears, and moves through the ruins of the world to the mountain.</p>
<p>All of this is recorded. All of this is shown. None of it is explained. None of it has meaning independent of the traveler and the player&#8217;s experience. The traveler reconstructs the story by moving to a place in the world where a new chapter can be told. While the story, like all stories, is dependent on an imagined past, the play itself re-creates the story from the very first play. Without the traveler, without the reader, without the player, the writing is just an encoded possibility, a hope for a story. Every book, every game, every story is a ghost, a trace, a breath waiting for a body to enliven.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a companion. I was initially indifferent to others. The game has a trophy given when the player encounters 10 other players within the game. I earned this trophy on my first playthrough, as I moved forward and left other players behind. The second time, however, I met a traveler in a white robe.</p>
<p>Unlike most games with online multiplayer functionality, <em>Journey</em> doesn&#8217;t give players a way to talk to each other using voice or text. Instead, you can press a button to make a noise (which varies in tune with the game&#8217;s soundtrack) and create a single luminescent glyph.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on language. Because you can &#8220;talk&#8221; quietly or loudly by tapping the button lightly or holding it down with greater pressure, the game&#8217;s single hailing action can be incredibly expressive. I soon realized that the other traveler was calling my attention to places in the world I should explore. I found new ruins, hidden flowers, and secret glyphs which added to the story told in the visions. We had a way to acknowledge each other, to keep track of each other, and, most interesting of all, to chatter. Sometimes our speech had a clear purpose &#8212; &#8220;Come over here!&#8221; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; &#8220;Can you see me?&#8221; &#8212; but sometimes it was more a way to share excitement, or nervousness, or wonder. That is, it was a conversation in which clear communication was taking place, but in which that communication was entirely indifferent to individual words. It was a striking reminder of how much of a conversation is carried by tone and context rather than grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>As we moved through the world, the traveler taught me, and I was able to say thank you. In the moments of greatest beauty, we sang to each other. We were not only acknowledging each other, but acknowledging the world, and participating in it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I returned to <em>Journey</em> after my two complete playthroughs for a number of smaller, partial attempts. After the game is completed, the end of the first, tutorial level becomes a gateway where the player can jump to any of the later levels, rather than having to play the whole game in order. I collected the glowing symbols I had missed. I found the final hidden glyphs. I earned a white robe of my own. I tried and failed to take on the role of teacher.</p>
<p>So the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I put the robe away. I gave up the external signs of experience, and simply entered the world again.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on humility. While the story is dependent upon the player as a reader, an actor, a participant, the world itself endures unchanged. In most games, replay value is measured by variability of outcome &#8212; different choices resulting in a different story, different actions leading to a higher score. <em>Journey</em> has no score, and the world, the symbols, the glyphs, the visions, and the outcome are the same every time. You may approach the mountain alone or with a companion, clothed in brown or white, with a long flowing scarf or with almost no scarf at all. The mountain always strips all of these things away. The end is always the same.</p>
<p>And yet <em>Journey</em> is the only video game I can think of which I&#8217;ve played from beginning to end three times.</p>
<p>And the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I met a traveler. Somehow, I was better as a guide in the brown robe instead of the white, and I showed my companion the better paths. As we approached the mountain, in the final wind and snow, we were separated, and I did something I had never done before. I waited. When my companion was blown from the path, I sat in one place so that she could climb back and we could finish the journey together. Even then, somehow, she got ahead of me without my having seen her, and I found myself rising to catch up. I&#8217;m still not sure if I was mistaken somehow about her having lost the path, or if I was inattentive, or if she found a new way. None of these things seems likely, but I know for certain that we were separated and found each other further ahead. My patience, apparently, was nothing compared to my companion&#8217;s, as she waited for me to finish waiting for her. We entered the mountain together, to begin again, alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I saw the world.</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I learned the language.</p>
<p>The third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was part of the world.</p>
<p>I may yet return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 50 very pleasant hours playing BioWare&#8217;s <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, I&#8217;m at something of a loss to make sense of what just happened. Perhaps it&#8217;s useful to begin with my description of those 50 hours as &#8220;pleasant,&#8221; which isn&#8217;t quite correct. There was a tremendous &#8212; and very interesting &#8212; tension at work during my gameplay. I was often in something of a hurry, as the are very specific constraints on my play time, and portions of the <em>Mass Effect 2</em> experience are supremely slow. I found myself cringing every time I needed to move beyond my immediate surroundings by taking a shuttle to a new landing site or docking at a city. Even taking the elevator between levels on Commander Shepard&#8217;s ship the Normandy meant an interminable wait staring at a loading screen. The <em>Mass Effect</em> universe is a place constantly tottering on the brink of total collapse, with each of the various societies Shepard encounters pleading for intervention in the final minutes of their darkest hour, but there&#8217;s no particular urgency. If Shepard receives a report of a ship in danger of falling into a planet&#8217;s atmosphere, the player can rely on the event to not actually occur until Shepard has leisure enough to make the trip.</p>
<p>In fact, the unintended implication of <em>Mass Effect</em>&#8216;s episodic but non-sequential narrative architecture may be that the truly moral choice would be for Shepard to fly from system to system but never actually land. Each of the distress calls would continue to beckon, preserved in a stasis where some existential danger has been comprehended, but eternally delayed. I like to imagine entire generations living their whole lives on that ship, passing the story of the hero who will come to save them to their children and their children&#8217;s children. It&#8217;s an appealing counternarrative to the adolescent fantasy of an individual hero whose labors succeed where armies, scientists, and politicians have failed. It would also save the player from having to wait for all of those loading screens.</p>
<p>Even so, while it may not be quite right to speak of my time playing the game as pleasant, I have to acknowledge that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> was a rich experience. Peter Brooks<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> argues that a great deal of the pleasure of narrative comes not just from knowing the ending, but in the postponement of the ending, and in that light, <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a masterpiece. The plot of <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is actually pretty thin &#8212; Shepard dies (why not?), is brought back to figure out who is kidnapping entire human colonies, a crew is recruited, some navigational information is recovered, and everyone flies to the center of the galaxy to save the world and learn a little something about themselves.</p>
<p>But while the main story itself doesn&#8217;t give the player that much to do, there are a million ways to put off doing that handful of things. Every character Shepard recruits wants something, and expects Shepard to get, save, and/or destroy it for them. While I think BioWare would argue that these errands constitute a major part of the main storyline &#8212; and they did indeed compose a significant fraction of my play time &#8212; they&#8217;re also entirely optional. More importantly, in terms of the narrative architecture, making the character loyalty missions optional means that they have to be entirely independent of each other. Nothing that you do on any one loyalty mission can directly affect any other because the game can&#8217;t assume that you&#8217;ve completed (or will ever complete) any specific mission before completing another. Without that necessary sequential relation, there is no room for causes and effects. Each mission is its own context, meaning, and self-contained consequence, and Shepard remains a blank state onto which entire civilizations can project their hopes and fears, a knight-errant.</p>
<p>While BioWare is famous for their choice-centered <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/04/22/mass-effect/">good or evil/light side vs. dark side/paragon vs. renegade</a> gameplay, and for creating game franchises where the choices made in earlier games carry over into sequels, these choices can necessarily have only marginal impacts. If the player makes a choice that results in a character&#8217;s death in an earlier game, then this character will not show up in the sequel, but since each game must be created to encompass both the possibility that character X is alive and dead, then characters from earlier games <em>must</em> be limited to secondary (or cameo) roles in later games. Commercial constraints mean that BioWare cannot create a <em>Mass Effect 3</em> which cannot be beaten (or is ultimately any less rich of an experience) if any single character is killed in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. (Imagine, for example, a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> where it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether Boromir or Aragorn dies. Tolkien would not have been able to make Aragorn so central to the plot of the second book, and so absolutely critical to the resolution of the war. Boromir&#8217;s death would be robbed of its classically tragic nobility.)</p>
<p>The result is that each game demands that you assemble a new cast of characters, and largely abandon your previous crew. Relationships still exist, sort of, but of necessity cannot be central to the action or narrative development of the new game. There are major choices in <em>Mass Effect 2</em> that promise to impact <em>Mass Effect 3</em> &#8212; you can strengthen or decimate the Geth, you can deliver the Collector base to Cerberus or destroy it &#8212; but these decisions cannot do much more than change a handful of cutscenes. (The outcome of the war does not really depend on whether you win the loyalty of Rohan or tell them off.)</p>
<p>None of which is to say that you shouldn&#8217;t play <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. It&#8217;s an extraordinary game in terms of visuals, setting, and characterization, but it&#8217;s a triumph of storytelling and not of story, of world building and not of narrative. Raph Koster has argued that <a href="http://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/20/narrative-is-not-a-game-mechanic/" target="_blank">&#8220;Narrative is not a game mechanic&#8221;</a> &#8212; that is that narrative in video games is not a central operation of the game itself but a way for the game to provide feedback to a player who is navigating the game&#8217;s essentially non-narrative problem set (mash button, kill monster, steer car, etc.). I&#8217;m not totally convinced by Koster&#8217;s argument, but <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a pretty strong example of what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a picaresque (and a good one) and not a novel. It&#8217;s a convincing illusion of a world in which the player has agency and choices have persistent effects, even though the overarching story does its best to undo those effects. None of these observations are meant to be criticisms of the quality of the game. In fact, most of them could be addressed if BioWare were designing individual, standalone games rather than franchises. It&#8217;s not the mechanic/narrative interface that defeats the possibility of player choices from having a significant and lasting impact on the narrative world, it&#8217;s the lack of a clear and specific endpoint.</p>
<p>The world doesn&#8217;t end, and because the world continues, the game has to account for all the choices the player <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make.</p>
<p>So do enjoy <em>Mass Effect 2</em> &#8212; I did &#8212; but don&#8217;t feel bad if you take your time about it. The world will wait for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong> Remember <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/16/a-day-in-the-life/">my <em>Octodad</em> review</a>? Well, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1432651738/octodad-2?at=1f33aab22cb79d0b&amp;response_id=450058" target="_blank">they are making a sequel</a> thanks to Kickstarter.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1432651738/octodad-2/posts" target="_blank">they’ve re-released <em>Octodad</em> in celebration</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to properly celebrate this occasion we’ve decided to release an updated version of Octodad 1 with <strong>TWO NEW LEVELS!</strong> Right now only the <strong>Windows v1.5</strong> is available due to some issues with Mac’s Lion OS, but Mac owners can expect their own v1.5 in <strong>September</strong>. Now these levels aren’t for the feint of heart and are a bit of a challenge, but they do bring a bit of closure to the first game’s story.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Gavin’s reflections about <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/08/06/let-me-tell-you-a-story/">narratives in video games</a> plays nicely with a Rock, Paper, Shotgun piece about why <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/01/look-single-player-people-are-just-better/" target="_blank">single player gamers are a better ilk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stress again, I would hate it if I appeared pompous at all when I suggest that single-player gaming, ever-more the forgotten gem of our hobby, is for the more sophisticated, intellectual individual. It takes something more, a different kind of mind, a more educated, refined view, to understand and value the art of the single-player. Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>The worth of single-player comes in the form of narrative. As with any good novel, or a finely crafted film. It is the equivalent to literature. While multiplayer is an ill-informed argument. It has no direction, no beginning nor end, no meaning.</p>
<p>Games are made with intent. Like books, films and television, the finest examples among them are those that both exist to say something, but allow the player to create his own interpretation. And while of course there are any number of poor or stupid single-player games, there is no multiplayer that evenly closely matches the finest RPG or adventure.</p>
<p>Like I say, I would be just mortified if anyone interpreted these words to be snooty or condescending. I’m just saying people who prefer single player games are a better class than people who mostly opt for multiplayer.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.roflgames.com/DPadWebsite/www/index.htm" target="_blank"><em>Owlboy</em> will be released this year.</a> It’s one of the few platformers I’ve actually gotten excited about since <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/" target="_blank"><em>Doukustu Monogatari</em></a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkwgJK88Ajs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The demo should be released on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The Independent Games Festival’s chairman, Brandon Boyer, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36571/GDC_Europe_We_Have_A_Responsibility_To_Support_Indies_Says_IGF_Chairman_Boyer.php#comment115948" target="_blank">calls for independent developers to push the limits of the game experience and for consumers to pay a fair wage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For too long we’ve been relying on this model that says that games are more or less interchangeable products, marketed and sold as products, and if they’re all just slight variations on the same theme, or if they do little more than give our thumbs something to do in idle time, of course we’re going to be wise shoppers and choose the cheapest among them.</p>
<p>An album purchased on iTunes can cost nearly ten times as much as most people are willing to spend on a game — even when that album itself is actually embedded in the game — [the slide here is of the $1.99 NOBY NOBY BOY app sitting right on top of the $11.99 NOBY NOBY BOY soundtrack] but by and large people don’t buy an album to listen to it once and complain it only took 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>People value music more because it adds an emotional pitch and rhythm and color to life, it speaks to something more essential, it reminds them of a place and time, it reminds them of where they were when they first experienced it and who they experienced it with.</p>
<p>And there’s no reason that we shouldn’t also be aspiring to that same exact sort of resonance in whatever small ways, crafting experiences that invite people to return to them, not because it extends a dollar value, but because it feels like a place they actually want to re-visit, or adds that same color and rhythm.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Lastly, here is a cinematic trailer for the <em>Guns of Icarus</em> MMO.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/27596349" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games are a troublesome medium. Rogert Ebert, famously, <a target="new" href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html">isn&#8217;t convinced that they&#8217;re art</a>. Even those of us who love video games are often apologetic. Yes, many video games are just terrible. Yes, it&#8217;s true that no video game can stand up to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or Beethoven&#8217;s Fifth Symphony, or <em>Ulysses</em>. (Or maybe <em>War &amp; Peace</em>, if you&#8217;re the sort of person who doesn&#8217;t like <em>Ulysses</em>. I happen to like <em>Ulysses</em>.)</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m primarily interested in video games as a medium for narrative and story, not despite but because I think it&#8217;s an open question whether video games are particularly well-suited to narrative.</p>
<p>In fact, depending on what and how you read, the idea of video games as a venue for narrative is in trouble right now. This week, IGN ran a piece on <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/118/1185726p1.html" target="_blank">the end of the $60 single-disc big-budget video game</a> in favor of less-expensive segmented downloads. (This business model is actually not all that far from a lot of &#8220;single-disc&#8221; games, which offer players the opportunity to purchase and download additional content &#8212; &#8220;DLC&#8221; &#8212; after the initial purchase of the physical disc. It just eliminates the requirement that the player buy the disc first.) <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6828237/beyond-angry-birds" target="_blank">Tom Bissell&#8217;s piece in Grantland</a> makes explicit the implied stakes of the low-cost, low-budget gaming world to come:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few months ago, a producer at a major video-game company startled me by admitting that the economic viability of the triple-A video-game production cycle — the expensive development process, in other words, by which games like Halo, Grand Theft Auto, Uncharted, and BioShock are unleashed upon the world — is in all likelihood doomed. Shortly after that, a developer told me he has a hard time imagining how single-player narrative video games are going to survive in the long run; such games, he believes, will eventually be seen as a historical anomaly. Neither man was particularly thrilled to imagine a future largely absent of the kinds of games he makes and most cares about, but current trends could not be ignored.</p>
<p>I told the developer that he sounded a bit like my fiction-writer friends going on about the inevitable death of the novel. &#8220;It takes one person to write a novel,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;To make the kinds of games we&#8217;re talking about, you need several dozen people — probably more like a hundred — with training across several fields. If the money&#8217;s not there, which is increasingly the case, the games can&#8217;t be made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that Bissell&#8217;s skepticism of the developer&#8217;s assertion is well-founded. The sky may well be falling, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that everything is coming to an end. Much like the death of the studio system that controlled prewar American filmmaking, the end of a particular business model will not mean the end of a medium.</p>
<p>While Bissell&#8217;s piece focuses on iPad games, including a number that tell stories surprisingly well, I&#8217;d like to try to shift the terms of the conversation a bit. (An ambitious goal, I know, but I&#8217;m going to take for granted that <em>Idler</em> readers will know from Andrew Simone&#8217;s writing that <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/02/essential-indie-games/" target="_blank">indie/web browser games can tell outstanding and challenging stories with incredibly limited resources</a>.)</p>
<p>First, there is a central mistake in considering whether video games as a medium are well-suited for narrative. The implied analogy is between video games and a genre like the novel or the fiction film, where narrative tools are built into the conceptual framework of the work itself. Video games, however, are a <em>medium</em> and not a <em>genre</em>. The more appropriate analogy would be between the video game and the book. Video games, like books, can be a productive venue for narrative, but like books, video games can be successful entirely independent of whether narrative exists within the individual work, and the success, failure, or indifference of the individual work is immaterial to the larger question as to whether narrative can work within a video game. A book of poetry may entirely ignore narrative, but it would be foolish to conclude from the fact that many great books exist which contain no narrative all that books are ill-suited to telling stories.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-media comparisons can be occasionally illuminating, but to judge video games by the narrative standards and conventions of the novel, opera, drama, or the fiction film is ultimately a mistake. Will video games ever produce a <em>Ulysses</em>? Clearly not. <em>Ulysses</em> already exists. Video games would (and do) do better to measure by and build on its own benchmarks.</p>
<p>And video games <em>do</em> tell some compelling stories, using their own tools, and with their own unique strengths and flaws. Rather than figuring out whether <em>Heavy Rain</em> is as good as your favorite novelist, however, let&#8217;s talk about what makes its story work, and try to imagine what stories video games could (and should) be telling, especially if the big-budget, risk-averse, &#8220;let&#8217;s-make-another-sequel&#8221; business model comes crashing down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my challenge to video game critics, players, and creators. I&#8217;ll do what I can to live up to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings faithful readers!</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> My gaming time this past week was comparatively light, because I spent the weekend at <a href="http://www.2011.greatlakesthatcamp.org/" target="_blank">The 2011 Great Lakes THAT Camp</a> talking about video games, rather than at home playing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is THAT Camp?&#8221; you say? Excellent question! THAT is short for &#8220;The Humanities and Technology, and THAT Camp bills itself as an academic &#8220;un-conference,&#8221; where archivists, librarians, academics, and tech people (collectively, some of my favorite people in the world) get together to talk and work, rather than to present and listen.</p>
<p>As a pseudo-academic myself, it was wonderful. I was (not surprisingly) most interested in the game-related conversations, which ranged from using games and insights from game design in the classroom, to using games to explore past cultures (and the way that how we&#8217;ve understood past cultures has changed over time), to the nature of interactive narrative itself. Maybe most importantly, while I&#8217;ve always been deeply interested in how games (and literature) require the player (reader) to co-author their own experience, I&#8217;ve always viewed myself as a non-coder. That is, while I have the tools and capability to be a writer, I didn&#8217;t believe that I had the tools or capability to be a game designer. After THAT Camp, I&#8217;ve become aware of some tools and learned some things that might change that. (No, I won&#8217;t be designing <em>Portal 3</em>, but there are ways to create games that are much closer to the demands of indie, digital filmmaking than I ever would have imagined. That is to say, it&#8217;s not <em>easy</em>, but you don&#8217;t necessarily need a team of coders, knowledge of multiple programming languages, and support from Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo to do it.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that ideas from THAT Camp will pop up from time to time in this column over the next several weeks, and I&#8217;ll provide links where I can. You&#8217;ll get a great start by checking out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The THAT Camp web site/blog, which includes notes from many of the sessions&mdash;<a href="http://www.2011.greatlakesthatcamp.org/" target="_blank">http://www.2011.greatlakesthatcamp.org/</a></li>
<li>Play the Past, a site devoted to cultural/historical games&mdash;<a href="http://www.playthepast.org/" target="_blank">http://www.playthepast.org/</a></li>
<li>Inform 7, a tool for creating text-based games&mdash;<a href="http://inform7.com/" target="_blank">http://inform7.com/</a></li>
<li>The Electronic Literature Collection, an archive of digital (usually interactive) fiction and narrative&mdash;<a href="http://www.eliterature.org/" target="_blank">http://www.eliterature.org/</a></li>
<li><em>Alabaster</em>, an interactive retelling of the Snow White story&mdash;<a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/alabaster/" target="_blank">http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/alabaster/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And there&#8217;s more, of course there&#8217;s more, but that will do for now.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> What game time I&#8217;ve had this past week has been largely devoted to <em>LEGO Harry Potter</em>. (Probably, in part, as a break from &#8220;serious&#8221; or narrative games I was spending so much time talking about.) I&#8217;ve made no secret of the fact that on the whole I&#8217;m a fan of the Lego games, mostly because of the combination of humor, inventive visual presentation, and the way that it appeals to my OCD collector impulse. There are a million little things to chase after in each game, many of which require a second or third playthrough of each level to obtain, after you&#8217;ve unlocked a character with a new ability, or explored a little bit more.</p>
<p>Although I do have to admit that part of the appeal for me of the Lego games is the way that collecting items is primarily a function of time invested in the game. The game itself never really gets harder, and if there&#8217;s an item you can&#8217;t reach, it&#8217;s usually because later on you&#8217;ll unlock a character who can jump higher, or climb walls, or make things float, or whatever. The mechanic is one of collection furthering collectability, and <em>not</em> one of increasing difficulty and technical mastery.</p>
<p>That is to say, the core mechanic of the Lego games is a casual gaming mechanic, in which the game provides small, incremental rewards for investing a great deal of time into short, unconnected sessions of gameplay. The contrast to this mechanic would be &#8220;hardcore&#8221; games, which teach the player a specific set of skills and reflexes to allow progression through a series of increasingly difficult gameplay segments. (Think <em>Halo</em>, where you can clearly tell the difference between occasional players and those who spend hours and hours in online multiplayer sessions.) The true distinction between &#8220;casual&#8221; and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; games in this model may not be the total amount of time invested in the game, but the way in which the &#8220;casual&#8221; game allows the player to walk away from the game and return without having to re-learn significant proficiency in a particular skill set. If I&#8217;ve unlocked Jar Jar Binks in <em>LEGO Star Wars</em>, then I always have a character available who can double jump, and reach those out-of-reach items. If I&#8217;ve been away from <em>Halo</em> for a while, then I need to relearn the maps and re-exercise the reflexes and quick in-game judgments that let you pull the trigger before the other guy does.</p>
<p>And I think the fact that &#8220;casual&#8221; games may end up consuming every bit as much time, may reward every bit as much as investment as &#8220;hardcore&#8221; games&mdash;albeit in different ways&mdash;make &#8220;casual&#8221; and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; fairly misleading terms to use to describe the distinction. (After all, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/01/click-click-click-2/">I barely got out of Mafia Wars alive</a>. I still say there was nothing casual about how I played that game.)</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> I just got my hands on <em>Portal</em>. More on that next week!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s fairly broad agreement that Sony/Quantic Dream’s <em>Heavy Rain</em> was one of the great games of 2010. IGN.com awarded it <a target="new" href="http://bestof.ign.com/2010/ps3/best-ps3-game-of-the-year.html">“Game of the Year” for PS3</a>. It was a finalist for PS3 Game of the Year on Spike TV’s Video Game Awards. (It lost to <em>God of War III</em>, but c’mon, this was Spike TV.) Tom Bissell included it on his list of his <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/09/bissell-top-ten/">10 favorite games of 2010</a>. (I’m allowed a self-plug every now and then.)</p>
<p>Since I’m not sure that I played 10 new games during 2010&mdash;I definitely didn’t play 10 games that came out during 2010&mdash;I have the luxury of not having to decide whether <em>Heavy Rain</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> was a better game. It’s probably safe to say that I expect to play <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> more often in the future. I still have a boatload of trophies to get; I could spend hours playing poker, especially with the downloadable addition that lets me play with real people; I’ve barely touched the <em>Undead Nightmare</em> expansion.</p>
<p>But for all that, <em>Heavy Rain</em> is the game that I want more new games to be like.</p>
<p><em>Heavy Rain</em> is not a perfect game, even in the places where it is strong. As video games go, the story is incredible, engrossing, but not (in absolute terms) revelatory. It&#8217;s a pretty good detective novel and not <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>. It is the first game I&#8217;ve played that takes advantage of the possibilities of narrative quietude. The opening chapters are often described as &#8220;slow&#8221; in reviews&mdash;my own wife used the words &#8220;boring as hell&#8221;&mdash;but they serve to give the player the beginnings of an emotional investment in the main character, Ethan Mars, and his relationships with his family. The sunny tone directly contrasts with the darkness and rain that consume the rest of the game.</p>

<p>Even more than that, the game asks you to care about the mundane, day-to-day life of the main character&mdash;that is to say, his <em>happiness</em> and not just his desires. <em>Heavy Rain</em> asks the player to do very un-game-like tasks: Get dressed. Set the table. Play with your kids. The game defers narrative progress for what feels like a substantial period of time, not just for a tutorial (although the opening chapters are undeniably that), but to ask you to live Ethan&#8217;s life for a little while. The game asks you to trust that the things that you do will matter later, and they do. Not quite in the way promised on the box (&#8220;Your smallest decisions <strong>can change everything</strong>&#8220;&mdash;a promise I&#8217;m not sure the game lives up to), but because when you&#8217;re rushing to find your son before he drowns in slowly rising rainwater, you&#8217;re not just trying to save a collection of pixels. You&#8217;re working to save the boy you played with in your backyard during better times.</p>
<p>And you do some dark things to get there.</p>
<p>Most reviewers have rightly praised <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s &#8220;no game-over&#8221; mechanic, where the game simply continues to progress regardless of &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221; choices, up to and including those which lead to the deaths of one or more of the four playable characters. Of course, this mechanic isn&#8217;t exactly an innovation. <em>Maniac Mansion</em> used it back in 1987.</p>

Don&#039;t deny it.</p></div> Similarly, while the context-sensitive quick-response actions the player uses to interact with key events are perfectly suited to the game, and somehow make more sense, for example, in a fight scene than the more standardized button-based inputs used by most games. For example, in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the L2 button draws your gun from its holster, and the R2 button pulls the trigger. All the time. In Heavy Rain, the game might ask you to move the right joystick slowly downward to put a plate on a table, or press and hold a specific series of buttons in order to climb on to a ledge, but in either case the inputs only work when the screen asks for them, and they have to be performed in the correct manner&mdash;quickly, gently, all at once&mdash;or the action fails. This is, of course, a more refined version of a quick-response game like the 1983 <em>Dragon&#8217;s Lair</em> (which, incidentally, was re-released this year for the Wii).</p>
<p>In another context, I&#8217;d love to argue about how interactive <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s overarching storyline really is or isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d happily complain about the one moment where the game betrays its narrative structure&mdash;a character does something that you&#8217;re not aware of, and the game, in effect, lies to you about it. I&#8217;d really enjoy hearing from people what sort of replay value people found from the game, especially in light of the discovery (which kind of surprised me) that <a target="new" href="http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/698809/Quantic-Dreams-David-Cage-Play-Heavy-Rain-Several-Times-Kill-The-Magic-Of-It.html">the game&#8217;s principle designer really thinks that players should only play it once</a>. But here what I really want to say is that <em>Heavy Rain</em> is a game that needs to be imitated, and well.</p>
