										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eddie Murphy has made plenty of odd films. But, at least his odd film of the 1980s was odd in an interesting way, not because he wore a fat suit.</p>
<p><a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305310351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=6305310351&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>The Golden Child</em></a> (1986) is odd, because it blends action, comedy, fantasy, and elements of Chinese mysticism.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Yes, <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUCQX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QUCQX8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>Big Trouble in Little China</em></a> has all of those things too (and they came out the same year).</p>
<p>But, only one of these films has Eddie Murphy, and that is the big difference (even though Kurt Russel is great in <em>Big Trouble</em>). I have read <em>The Golden Child</em> was <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Child#Production_details">originally planned</a> as a very serious adventure film, but when Murphy was brought on, it switched gears.</p>
<p>So, now you have Eddie Murphy fighting demons, traveling to Tibet, and searching for magical weapons.</p>
<p>Ah, the 1980s. What an era for film.</p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s humor and comedic timing help balance the mystical elements of the film. Had this film taken itself more seriously, I doubt it would have been nearly as enjoyable. Just when the story gets really deep into the mystical side, there&#8217;s Murphy with a joke, or a goofy expression to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>When you have a story with a demon in human form trying to feed a supernatural child blood to weaken his powers, you need a few jokes here and there. It helps keep the dark, occult themes (of which there are many) from overpowering the story.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some &#8220;whatever&#8221; moments, such as when Murphy has to carry a glass of water through an obstacle course without spilling a drop. And, why is a social worker The Chosen One who can save The Child?</p>
<p>But who cares? There is also a dragon lady. And let us not forget the classic, “I want the knife” scene.</p>

<p>I have probably watched this film, in part or in whole, about a hundred times. It was a fixture on TV in my youth. It was almost always on at any given point, especially the weekends. Sure, it is an odd film, but it has a bit charm, thanks to Eddie Murphy in his prime. This was just after <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>, when he could do no wrong.</p>
<p>Some might disagree, and say <em>The Golden Child</em> was Murphy&#8217;s only stumble during his string of hits in the 1980s. Compared to his other films of the eighties, <em>The Golden Child</em> sticks out like a sore thumb, but only due to its plot. In terms of box office, the film was a success (although, I have read, not in the eyes of the studio).</p>
<p>And as someone who grew up in the 1980s, <em>The Golden Child</em> was a success in keeping me entertained. Over and over again.</p>
