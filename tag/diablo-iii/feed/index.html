										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to admit that I am way behind <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/22/cave-story-power-up/">Daniel</a> and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/23/cave-story-the-zig-zag-world/">Gavin</a> in my playthrough of <em>Cave Story</em> because I have been clocking a lot of hours into <em>Diablo III</em>, which actually makes for an interesting comparison.</p>
<p>Like <em>Cave Story</em>, <em>Diablo III</em> is a game that panders to one&#8217;s nostalgia, in this case nostalgia for <em>Diablo II</em>, released way back in 2000. I remember coming home from summer camp and pouring all of my time into accumulating new weapons and armor for my Amazon. The point of the Diablo games isn&#8217;t to defeat monsters; it&#8217;s to collect more stuff, which is good for helping you collect more stuff. <em>Diablo III</em> is certainly a vast improvement upon its predecessor, but overall, it&#8217;s really the same game built for 2013. I won&#8217;t say too much more about Diablo, since I&#8217;m supposed to be talking about <em>Cave Story</em>, but basically <em>Diablo III</em> has all the talent and polish of a triple-A title. And for those reasons, it basically has no heart.</p>
<p>Few games have more heart than <em>Cave Story</em>. It was painstakingly hand-crafted (so to speak) by Daisuke Amaya, who designed and developed the game by himself over the course of five years. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogs.vandal.net/12458/vm/13302725112007" target="_blank">decent interview</a> with Amaya, where he explains that his work on the game paralleled his life: &#8220;At the time I started work on <em>Cave Story</em>, I was a student, but now I&#8217;m an office worker. My entire life had changed by the time this game was finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right: Amaya is not a game developer by trade, so he created the art, music, and story, as well as all the code, in his free time. It may be a nostalgic platformer, but <em>Cave Story</em> feels like the personal expression of one man. We all love the game&#8217;s weirdness (or in Daniel&#8217;s words, the <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/15/cave-story-lets-get-retro/">&#8220;WTF factor&#8221;</a>), which is something that can only come from the vision and imagination of singular vision.</p>
<p>So why am I not compelled to play more <em>Cave Story</em>? </p>
<p>For me, the appeal of <em>Cave Story</em> is its charm. Sure, it&#8217;s fun to jump around and fire rockets, but I love uncovering the uniqueness buried beneath the <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired platforming. <em>Diablo</em>, on the other hand, is designed to be addictive. And it is very good at that, almost to the point of blandness. The game says and means nothing.</p>
<p>While both are designed to make you think about the good old days, I think there&#8217;s a single key difference between the two games: <em>Cave Story</em> celebrates nostalgia, while <em>Diablo III</em> exploits it.</p>
