										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I mentioned <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/15/writing-through-the-pain/">a few weeks ago</a> that I was going on a lot of first dates, and <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/07/two-quick-thoughts/">last week</a> I listed a handful of old games that I would really like to be able to say that I had played. I’m happy to say that first dates have progressed to second dates, and that there’s a special someone that might be worth going exclusive with for a while, but we’ll come back to that in a minute.</p>

Along with <em>Ocarina of Time</em> for the N64, <em>A Link to the Past</em> is often listed as among the best of the wonderful <em>Zelda</em> series, with <em>Ocarina</em> seemingly a slightly better overall experience, but credit given to <em>A Link to the Past</em> for creating the formula that has structured nearly every Zelda game since—IGN states that <em>A Link to the Past</em> <a target="new" href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/757/757573p1.html">“is the only true Zelda, and [designer] Miyamoto and team simply keep remaking it, over and over.”</a></p>
<p>However, I haven’t done much more than dip my toe into <em>A Link to the Past</em>, largely because I haven’t decided how I want to play it yet. The game is available both as a Game Boy Advance (GBA) cartridge selling new on Amazon for $19.99, and as a download on the Wii Virtual Console for 800 points ($8). Both versions are a more-or-less unaltered port of the original SNES game, so there’s not much to help me decide there. The GBA cartridge includes a second game <em>Four Swords Adventure</em>, which has received fairly good reviews, but which I don’t really have much intention of playing. I’d really like the portability of the GBA version, but it’s taking me a while to reconcile myself to shelling out more than twice the price of the Virtual Console download.</p>
<p>I may have to remind myself that it’s a price paid for convenience, and that portable gaming is not universally cheaper than the more powerful stay-at-home version. When the original Game Boy was released, I was shocked that this tiny, black-and-white LCD system cost nearly as much ($90, as I recall) as a full-powered, full-color NES (which could be had for about $100). When the PlayStation Portable was released, it was actually more expensive at $245 than the PlayStation 2, which was $180 at the time.</p>
<p>And, at least for me, I think it’ll be worth it. I’ll download <em>Ocarina of Time</em> for the Virtual Console, since that’s the only way it’s currently available, and pay a little bit extra for <em>A Link to the Past</em>. Because, after all, I’m only playing <em>A Link to the Past</em> on the side, when I can steal a few minutes here and there. My home gaming time is increasingly spoken for by the gorgeous, engrossing <em>Heavy Rain</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s another column.</p>

Awesome.</p></div>By the way, is anyone else really excited about the pending re-release/update of <em>GoldenEye 007</em> for the Wii? I largely yawned over the PS2 <em>GoldenEye</em> “sequel” a few years ago, but I’m genuinely eager to get my hands on the original again, and all the better for the Daniel Craig voice-overs.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll shell out for the bundle with the “<a target="new" href="http://www.amazon.com/James-Bond-007-GoldenEye-Controller-Nintendo/dp/B003O6FW6E/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287063678&amp;sr=1-1">gold Wii Classic Controller Pro</a>,” but is it a sign of approaching middle age that I’m not upset that I can’t choose between the $50 update and a $10 port of the Piece Brosnan original on the Virtual Console?</p>
