										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Hitler! What would you have thought about how much literary and artistic inspiration your heinous political persona has given the world over the last seventy-odd years? </p>
<p>It’s an interesting conundrum to think about how much influence the actions of this failed art student (enveloped in the form of a mad dictator) have had on the world of imagination. On one hand, it should be no surprise that, so long as the Holocaust survivor narrative continues &#8212; by first hand account or recorded for future generations &#8212; we wrestle with the atrocity that was the systematic genocide of millions of Jews, homosexuals, Romani and people with disabilities, among others. Nazism remains a deep, unhealed scar on the Western world, perhaps always to be so, that practically begs interaction with the artistic mind. We write, draw, film, and craft to work out our demons and attempt to unravel reality toward a full understanding of its meaning. I spent two years in college studying with one of the foremost American minds on the philosophical reach of the Holocaust* and my mind still remains overwhelmed by its consequences. Some spend their entire careers as such.</p>
<p>Comic books, because of their development and growth in the era surrounding World War II, have an inextricable connection to the Nazi threat. Captain America and many more heroes of the Golden Age owe their origins in one form or another to these events. War comics, such as <em>Sgt. Rock</em> and <em>G.I. Combat</em>, spanned decades of publication, depicting the fight against Hitler’s rise month in and month out for readers on the edge of their seats. Time has marched on, of course, as the marketplace finds less viability for the war comic genre. Even the Justice Society of America has replaced Nazism in its core narrative with an inter-dimensional threat in order to maintain the credibility of its members’ ages &#8212; if not just because the battles of World War II now feel distant to a younger readership. Yet, despite all this, Hitler and his directives still pervade the public consciousness, perhaps more sharply than ever before.</p>
<p>But where does a struggle to understand bleed over into monumentalizing a single man? From Quentin Tarantino’s film <em>Inglouious Basterds</em>, a stylized Jewish revenge fantasy about hunting down Nazis and killing Hitler, to Maurizio Cattelan’s photorealistic sculpture of <em>Hitler Kneeling</em> as a supplicant child, artists continue to engage not just with the historical context, but with the man himself. We continue to go back to the well with Adolf, ever transforming him into a character as commodified as Mickey Mouse or Superman &#8212; an irony that should not be lost on students of history. Indeed he is foremost depicted today as either an inept laughingstock (think <a href="http://youtu.be/d_RXwrYa4sk" target="_blank">Hitler’s Reaction to <em>Halo 4</em></a>) or a surmountable foe, but he remains a singular part of the cultural zeitgeist decades later. His personal presence is enshrined not simply in history, but truly in posterity.</p>
<p>As if to hit that particular nail on the head, arrived <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em>, the 2007 graphic novel by Norwegian writer/artist Jason, distributed in the United States by Fantagraphics Books. A uniquely touching, yet amusing, tale of melancholic love and obligation, <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em> is set in a world where murder-for-hire is a legal profession. The main character is approached by a scientist to take on a very challenging assignment &#8212; the murder of Adolf Hitler. It seems the scientist has developed a time machine, which only now, after fifty years, is fully charged and ready for a round trip expedition to 1938 Germany. The killer simply must step inside and push a single button, and emerge to shoot Hitler before repeating the trip back home. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Of course, as little time travel ever goes precisely as planned, the killer is overwhelmed by Hitler’s guard and replaced in the time capsule by the Fuhrer himself. Now arriving in the present day, Hitler is met by the killer again, seventy years older &#8212; not nearly as spry as in his professional heyday. The end result is a vanished dictator, a disappointed client, and a man out of time, returned to the life he once knew a much older and exhausted figure.</p>

<p>Like <em>Maus</em> long before it, there’s a psychology to depicting tough emotional content with anthropomorphized subjects. In this case, it’s not atrocity or inhumanity that needs exaggeration as much as a certain melancholia and seriousness that requires undermining. In a world where Hitler roams free and assassination is a viable profession not unlike medicine or the law, to experience human disappointment and anxiety through a collection of dogs, rabbits and birds alleviates a bit of narrative weight. That is to say, there’s a built-in affection that comes with a canine killer and his erstwhile girlfriend that permeates every panel. Jason’s art is simultaneously adorable and moody, with autumnal colors throughout reflecting back the aged nature of a protagonist who had to time travel back home the hard way &#8212; one day at a time. Wrinkles upon the brow and eyes of a dog, one must admit, are far more endearing than on any human being.</p>
<p>The sense of silence throughout the graphic novel reflects back on the idea of distance as well &#8212; distance traveled through time and the emotional distance between the killer and his former girlfriend. For this isn’t science fiction, nor is it historical narrative. <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em> is a love story between two people who may not particularly like each other, but grow to a fondness that may simulate need. Jason doesn’t use captions or thought bubbles, and his dialogue &#8212; sometimes witty, sometimes simply functional &#8212; takes second place to the advanced sense of body language and posture he infuses in each character. Figures slouch, remain barefoot and vulnerable to the world, and find themselves staring blankly toward doorways or across streets. Never quite where they anticipated ending up, all the characters seem listless, but not fully resigned. Momentum may be ever so slow, but it still exists in this inverted existence, much like the experience of late life aging itself.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10804" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/11/22/our-life-with-adolf/ikilledadolf4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ikilledadolf4.jpg" data-orig-size="640,446" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IkilledAdolf4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ikilledadolf4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ikilledadolf4.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ikilledadolf4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=446" alt="Better late than never" title="IkilledAdolf4" width="640" height="446" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10804" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ikilledadolf4.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ikilledadolf4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ikilledadolf4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=209 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, the Fuhrer is no more than a MacGuffin for the plot of <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em>, a reason to separate the killer from the life he knew and return him in a different emotional state. His place in this heartfelt narrative is merely utilitarian, one of the most frightening men of the twentieth century reduced to a caricature running off panel. And yet, maybe that’s the true irony of Hitler’s own creative ambition and ruthless attempts at posterity. For such a horror to be summarized in a cartoonish footnote, perhaps power truly has shifted out of the hands of evil into the imagination of a world thriving in his absence. I may never be fully resigned to seeing old Adolf jumping across my screen or page with impunity, but I can certainly join the wrinkled canine protagonist in raising a glass to his demise. “Fuck you, Adolf Hitler” indeed.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>* Want to experience that mind firsthand? Look up <em>Vessels of Evil: American Slavery and the Holocaust</em> by my mentor and brilliant sophisticate Laurence Mordekhai Thomas. It’s challenging, but you won’t be sorry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While in Denver for a summer wedding, I had the opportunity to visit the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), a smallish, spare, but amazing space in the city’s downtown. Though contemporary art is thought of by many as bizarre, lacking in subtlety, garish or shocking for the sake of being garish and shocking, the contemporary section of any art museum tends to be my favorite. Is it because I’m a postmodernist who critiques, but ultimately embraces the power of play, metaplay, and remixing? Is it because I’m the kind of mucky muck who throws around words like “postmodern?” Who’s to say? It’s not that I’m against the more classic works, no, not at all! Mostly, I’m just not very moved by the “crusty old portraiture of important white dudes and the wives who married them” displays in your typical art museum. Funny then that the work that most struck and inspired me at the MCA was a collection of what, at first glance, seems to be exactly that kind of historical portraiture.  </p>
<p>So, yes, when I paid my (actually pretty cheap) entrance fee and turned the corner to see Frohawk Two Feathers’ first room of pieces I wasn’t too sure what I had gotten myself into. Upon further inspection, I found a number of portraits and maps each painted and weathered in a style that suggests they were artifacts from a distant past. The portraits featured royals, generals, early settlers from a colonial history dreamed up and intricately fleshed out by Two Feathers’ research and imagination. Instead of your typical placards simply offering title, medium, and artist information, the signs also presented a healthy helping of facts about the figures and spaces depicted in the paintings. Moving from piece to piece, one gathers patchwork pieces of the larger story of the “Frenglish Empire” and its expansion to North American territory. Somewhat based upon historical accounts of figures like Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte, Two Feathers’ narrative is built from many familiar plot points. The pictures and their accompanying (his)stories ultimately play with, question, and critique the histories we know and cling to while additionally parsing issues of domination, colonialism, wealth, and representation.  </p>
<p>Frohawk Two Feathers’ commentary on authenticity and archives as it forms in this production of false-ish history is complex, revisionary, and playful. Depictions of these people &#8212; people important enough to be enunciated through art and whose renderings are then worthy of keeping as historical artifact &#8212; are refreshingly colorful, tattooed, and often outfitted in period costume with nods to modern day urban and ethnically marked looks. Men and women sport bandanas and teardrop tats on their brown (Native, Spanish, African, mixed) bodies while holding the poses of the noble people we overwhelmingly have encountered as white in our historical instruction. In creating these characters, he imagines a history in which people of color make the rules, set the fashions, mark the territory, and though it is no less war-mongering than the stories we already know, the insertion of color in this way not only creates a picture of pride and power where we rarely see one (as in a museum setting) but also critiques the level to which white history has been constructed as Truth.  </p>

<p>The artist’s maps and sculptural artifacts such as drums and animal skins painted from the perspective of native peoples further complicate and renegotiate issues of constructedness, authenticity, and point of view. Representations of important battles might be framed with images of the gape-jawed gods that protect or rule a community &#8212; sea monsters ruling the edges of a map’s open water. Little white male figures looking like tiny George Washingtons are drawn cowering in fear or stupified in the face of more powerful native warriors on steady steeds. At times I felt Two Feathers’ message could devolve into a simple flipping of power &#8212; one that luxuriates in a revenge fantasy, or too simply plays with hot-button postcolonial concerns.  However, though I can’t explain it precisely, the feel of the entire show at the MCA never dipped that low. The tiny details in the tattoo and map ink and in the remaking, the fashioning of objects, successfully elevated the work into an endlessly thought-provoking and disruptive artistic plane.  </p>
<p>Since I know we can’t all attend weddings in Colorado, I suggest you check this artist out in whatever way you can. Two Feathers’ various multi-media pieces tug at the structures we so often take for granted as real or normative or invisible.  His work reminds us that the way we map and the things we archive define peoples and cultures and thus the cartographers and archivists hold a special power.  Through his invention of the past he demonstrates that history has always been storytelling and making, and history has always been and continues to be invented.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It started to flurry sometime in the middle of the second period of the 2012 Bridgestone Winter Classic. Just a few wispy, genuine flakes swirling down across a baseball field covered in cottony, fake snow and temporary ice. More than an appearance by The Roots, an array of what appeared to be flaming white trash cans, or the complimentary Winter Classic seat pads (thanks, Bridgestone), the subtle snow seemed intent on reminding a baseball park full of hockey fans why they were freezing their asses off to watch the Philadelphia Flyers and the New York Rangers play outside in January.</p>
<p>As a singular tiny, crystalline bit landed on my knee, I thought for a brief, poetic moment that hockey truly is meant to be watched outside, through the fog of warm breath in the frosty air&#8230;</p>
<p>Then I ran out of hot chocolate, my toe warmers stopped working, and the jet lag of a 13-hour flight from Tel Aviv to Philly set in. My next shivering thought, perhaps preconditioned by nearly three years of California residency: <em>What am I doing here?</em></p>
<p>When I finally warmed up, about five hours, two hot chocolates, and a car seat butt warmer later, I started thinking about the oddity that is outdoor hockey as we know it. After all, hockey lore holds that the sport was born in the great Canadian outdoors. How twisty and strange is it that now indoor hockey, at one time a technological marvel, seems to be the game&#8217;s obvious home, while the outdoor origins of the game are such a sparkling novelty?</p>
<p>Turns out it&#8217;s not so bizarre at all. Indoor ice rinks have been around for awhile &#8212; at least since the mid-1800s. And maybe every other hockey fan already knows this, but the game, with the rules and parameters we know and love today, was not even born on an outdoor sheet. Organized hockey is said to have been born in 1875 within the confines of the indoor Montreal Victoria Skating Rink. According to the <a href="http://www.iihf.com/se/iihf-home/history.html">International Ice Hockey Federation</a>, “It was the first known game which was pre-announced, where two named teams played on a confined ice area (a rink), where all names of the players were recorded as well as the score and the game was played with &#8216;a flat circular piece of wood,&#8217; a puck.”</p>
<p>Although the game at Victoria Skating Rink didn&#8217;t mark the end of outdoor play, it did herald a significant shift. The last international games to take place on outdoor, natural(ish) ice were the 1957 World Hockey Championships in Moscow, where maybe the weather was so arctic it seemed ludicrous to even consider an indoor arena. The final championship game between the Soviet Union and Sweden drew a record attendance: 50,000 spectators. (To put that in perspective, the 2012 Winter Classic pulled in 46,967 and both Philadelphia and the NHL were thrilled.)</p>
<p>Since then, despite the evident popularity, the incidence of professional <a href="http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/a-brief-history-of-outdoor-hockey/">outdoor hockey games</a> has been relatively few and far between: a 1962 game in Gothenburg, a 1991 game in Vegas (of all places), the infamous Michigan “Cold War” in 2001, the Edmonton “Heritage Classic” in 2003, and the start of the Winter Classic games in 2008 in Orchard Park, New York, are some of the most famous. With far flung teams in enormous leagues and finicky man-made ice, the indoor sport makes way more sense. And yet people still convince themselves that outdoor hockey is the real, authentic hockey &#8212; how the game was “meant to be” &#8212; despite the fact that this sentiment makes no historical sense. After all, pond hockey is a far cry from what amounts to an inside-out ice skating rink parked in whatever lucky football or baseball stadium has the honor of hosting thousands of eager fans. I’ve played backyard pond hockey &#8212; the Winter Classic was awesome, but it was not that.</p>
<p>And I guess, when you think about it, that’s exactly why so many people love to go: outdoor hockey <em>is</em> awesome. It’s an excuse for a total spectacle, the complete package. People don’t actually fork over hundreds of dollars to see outdoor hockey games and connect with the roots of a beloved sport. If they really wanted to do that they could take a vacation to Saskatchewan. Hockey fans buy expensive tickets, expensive team jerseys, and gallons of hot chocolate because they’re there to see an outrageous show: The Roots, the flaming white trash can thingies, the gently falling snowflakes, and of course, a spectacular game that’s “meant” to be played wherever there are a pile of adoring fans clamoring to see it.</p>

Great, adorable, hilarious, irreverent comics about history, which are totally readable no matter what level your history knowledge is. Even if your history knowledge is poor. Or bad. Or rotten. That&#8217;s hard to do. She even helps you learn more about history by reading her comics, while also keeping you throughly entertained. That&#8217;s even tougher to do.</p>
<p>Her self-published cartoon collection, <em>Never Learn Anything From History</em>, has been a runaway hit on the indie comic circuit. The book is a small selection of the 2007 &#8211; 2009 strips that appear on <a href="http://harkavagrant.com/">Hark, A Vagrant!</a>, Beaton&#8217;s sprawling website which chronicles the two-hundred-and-some, often-historical (but sometimes not) comic strips she&#8217;s produced over the past few years. While Beaton has drawn a couple cartoons for The <em>New Yorker</em> and <em>Harper&#8217;s</em>, as well as the beautiful Charlie Chaplin Festival poster celebrating the 2010 Janus Films Chaplin retrospective for Criterion, she is still best known for the <em>Hark, A Vagrant!</em> website which she updates several times a month. Probably the most widely-known image on the site is the Victorian-themed <a target="new" href="http://www.topatoco.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=TO&amp;Product_Code=BEAT-EXCITED-ASPH&amp;Category_Code=BEAT">&#8220;I Am Excited For Someone To Invent the T-Shirt&#8221;</a> drawing, ironically available on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>Possibly the second-most known work on the site&mdash;or at least the first thing of hers that I saw&mdash;is <a target="new" href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=213">the Poe And Verne strip</a>, parodying the apparently-real admiration Jules Verne had for Edgar Allan Poe. I didn&#8217;t know this when I first saw the strip, and I still thought it was hysterical and adorable. That is one of the nice things about Beaton&#8217;s work&mdash;it&#8217;s still funny if you don&#8217;t know the historical backstory behind it. Of course when I learned that Verne did, in fact, write fan mail to Poe, that it made it even cooler, which is another nice thing about Beaton&#8217;s strips: she does explain them. Most every comic, whether it appears in the book or on the site, has little footnotes printed below which are almost as fun to read as the cartoon itself (my favorite of which appears beneath <a target="new" href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=164">the &#8220;Kiss Me, Hardy / Kismet Hardy&#8221; strip</a>).</p>
<p>Because Kate Beaton really does know that much about history, and she&#8217;s only twenty-six (which puts her at a tender 23 at the time of <em>Hark, A Vagrant</em>&#8216;s 2007 inception). She has a degree in history and anthropology, which is obvious, but she also has a real passion for history which comes out in her almost-good-natured mocking of its characters. She&#8217;s great at reminding readers of the etiquette and attitudes of the time periods she creates comics about, while using these old standards to illustrate that a.) this is why people behaved in such a manner, and b.) that is exactly why it is so ridiculous. Rooting the basis of her narratives in their given time periods with scarily fine-tuned accuracy, Beaton throws in contemporary punchlines and commentary to hammer home the sometimes less-than-commendable motivations of the people in power, sometimes with delightfully scathing parodies of historical figures who obviously had <a target="new" href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=24">no regard for those around them or under their control.</a></p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=276"><img data-attachment-id="1268" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/10/20/kate-beaton-is-smarter-than-all-of-us/kbeaton-jackson/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kbeaton-jackson.jpg" data-orig-size="729,313" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="kbeaton-jackson" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kbeaton-jackson.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kbeaton-jackson.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kbeaton-jackson.jpg?w=300&#038;h=128" alt="Hark, A Vagrant" title="kbeaton-jackson" width="300" height="128" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1268" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kbeaton-jackson.jpg?w=298&amp;h=128 298w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kbeaton-jackson.jpg?w=596&amp;h=256 596w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/kbeaton-jackson.jpg?w=150&amp;h=64 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> In the case of more relatable historical figures, you can really feel Beaton&#8217;s affection for their stuffiness and social constructs even as she pokes fun at it all. Even when she is foul-mouthed (and it&#8217;s so funny when she is), she is sweet, and in the few autobiographical comics she does she paints herself as skeptical, down-to-earth and polite, all things which make her immediately likable. More of these types of drawings can be found on <a target="new" href="http://twitter.com/beatonna">Beaton&#8217;s Twitter feed</a>, which has over 1,900 followers. <a href="http://twitpic.com/21uhjr">Here</a> is my favorite of those.</p>
<p>In her recent seminar at The Center for Cartoon Studies in Vermont, Beaton said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing&mdash;nobody does.&#8221; Lets hope she keeps &#8220;not knowing&#8221; what she&#8217;s doing for a long time.</p>
