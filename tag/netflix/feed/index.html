										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don’t know what to watch on Netflix. Sometimes I’ve just had enough of watching <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a></em> and <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/02/23/downstairs-at-downton-abbey/">Upstairs, Downstairs</a></em> and even <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/">Paul Newman</a>. Sometimes I just want to see something I haven’t seen before.</p>
<p>So what do I do? I turn to Netflix to see what it can suggest for me. It magically delivers movies right to my television. Surely it can peer into my brain and have its algorithms magically intuit what I want to discover.</p>
<p>Here’s what Netflix is telling me:</p>
<p>Since I recently watched <em>Doctor Who</em>, I will want to watch <em>My Little Pony</em>. No, no I won’t. But when I tweeted my surprise at that recommendation (which then got retweeted a few times) I learned that maybe yes, yes I do. According to one tweeter, <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/">there’s a high correlation between <em>Who</em> fans and bronies</a>. In fact, that tweeter hunted down a number of other folks tweeting about My Little Pony to explain to them that <em>Doctor Who</em> fans and <em>Star Trek</em> fans and <em>My Little Pony</em> fans are all one and the same. I’m not sure any of us were convinced.</p>
<p>Because I’ve watched Buster Keaton’s <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> (a compilation of Keaton shorts, all of which are thoroughly enjoyable, especially if you’re watching them with a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old) and <em>Gosford Park</em> (which is way way way better than <em>Downton Abbey</em> in that it is smarter, funnier, subtler, and heartbreakinger), Netflix has paired them to create a category called “Crime Movies.” So based on my interest in <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> and <em>Gosford Park</em>, I will be interested in the top-rated <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> (too too true, though it’s a crime movie only in the way that the other two are also not crime movies), the most popular <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em> (definitely a crime movie, but while I do love Harry Bosch, I’m not a big Mickey Haller fan), as well as the <em>Dragon Tattoo</em> trilogy (yes! horrible violence and is-it-or-isn’t-it misogyny!), <em>Chinatown</em> (fill in your own joke here), <em>Kick-Ass</em> (I actually don’t know this one, and the description of it is not convincing me I want to), and <em>Return of the Pink Panther</em> (because that’s a crime movie, yessirreebob). Okay then, maybe not.</p>
<p>Further down the screen, Netflix recognizes that I have an interest in “witty crime movies” (true enough) based on the fact that I’ve watched &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> and <em>Gosford Park</em>. This time, it suggests <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em>, <em>The Way of the Gun</em>, <em>How to Steal a Million</em>, <em>Witness for the Prosecution</em>, <em>Evil under the Sun</em>, and <em>A Night in Casablanca</em>. Apparently witty crime movies are things made long ago, unless they involve Ryan Phillippe and Benicio del Toro, because sexy modern movie stars definitely equally witty intellect.</p>
<p>But if you combine <em>Sherlock Jr</em> with <em>Office Space</em>, Netflix will generate “comedies.” Some of these suggestions are spot-on. I’ve seen them and I’ve loved them. <em>Dr Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog </em>will never get stale, never ever ever. Of course, I own the DVD, with all the extras, but it’s nice to know that I can watch it at work and on my phone and, well, ahem. Back to the subject at hand. <em>The Big Lebowski</em> was plenty enjoyable when I saw it (though, unlike many of the movie’s fans, I only saw it the once). <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>? Is that really a comedy? I do enjoy it, though, as long as I skip over the offensive racist parts. <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> is, naturally, sheer genius (even if I can’t figure out how to get an umlaut over my n). Based on that track record, I think Netflix is right that I might enjoy <em>The Trip</em>, a mockumentary from Michael Winterbottom with Steve Coogan and Rob Bryden as a couple of actors on a foodie road trip across England. That’s right up my alley. And I have friends who love Louis C.K., so I’m willing to say that his <em>Hilarious</em> probably isn’t a far-fetched recommendation either, even though my gut tells me I won’t like it. But <em>TEDTalks: Smart Laughs</em>? Are you fucking kidding me? And <em>Daniel Tosh: Completely Serious</em>? You’d have to kill me to get me to watch those.</p>
<p>At least I’ll get to watch <em>The Trip</em> first.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doing Two Things Is Confusing</strong><br />
The year is 2000, Amazon, the burgoning internet book seller, splits off their new music department into a website called Nile.com. By 2011 every river has a .com address and is a commerce portal operated by Amazon.com. Over the next 10 years the internet is entirely dominated by single-serving sites. Subdomains don’t exist and more than 8 characters after the .com is considered obscene. As Netflix’s streaming catalog threatens to overshadow its classic DVD by mail program a bewildered public and confused stock market force Netflix to spin off its flagship productline into a new company for clarity’s sake. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Sadists</strong><br />
Fuck you for using our service. No seriously, fuck you. Oh you were just about to finish that streaming movie? <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/08/does-netflix-give-enough-warning-when-streaming-titles-expire.html" target="_blank">NOPE.</a> Expired. Fuck off.  Oh, you want another DVD? <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11262292/ns/business-us_business/t/frequent-netflix-renters-sent-back-line/" target="_blank">NOPE.</a> Slow your roll, asshole. Oh hey, do you want to connect with friends and privately share ratings and recommendations? <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html" target="_blank">NOPE</a>. Maybe try Facebook instead? <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/01/connecting-with-your-friends-on-netflix.html" target="_blank">OH NO WAIT FUCK THAT SHIT.</a> And hey, our way of saying thanks for those years of thoughtful reviews you wrote: <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/06/minor-update-to-member-reviews.html" target="_blank">STRIPPING ATTRIBUTION.</a> No one wants to know your name, bitch. Hey at least our website is easy to use. Do a search and if it’s streaming watch it now, if it’s on DVD add it to your queue. <a href="http://twitpic.com/6n72lq" target="_blank">HAHA FUCK YOU SEARCH TWICE.</a> </p>
<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Masochists</strong><br />
What do you mean you like my variety? I hate that about myself. The future isn’t in discs and my present streaming selection sucks. My core business model is a joke. Spank me on the stock market, abuse me in my comment threads. I deserve it. I don’t know why you keep giving me money anyways. I know everyone is mocking me when they call things “the Netflix of whatever”.  I know they just mean the new failure. I’m going to go cut myself. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix Is Having An Identity Crisis</strong><br />
I’m chopping off my hair, kicking out my core business, and uprooting myself to a different domain. You can call me Starchild Qwikster.  Netflix is my slave name. </p>
<p><strong>All of These Domains Were Already Taken</strong><br />
Flix.com<br />
Redenvelope.com<br />
Netdiscs.com<br />
Netdisx.com<br />
Maildiscs.com<br />

Quixtar.com<br />

<p><strong>Netflix: White Collar Squatter</strong><br />
Unhappy with their business model, Netflix decided to follow Google’s. They choose an impossible to remember company name then buy every spelling permutation to show ads against. </p>
<p><strong>Qwikster: Pawn in Corporate Chess</strong><br />
Netflix puts Qwikster up for sale. Amazon buys Qwikster. Netflix buys Hulu. Apple files anti-duopoly lawsuit.  Amazon merges with Netflix, hostilely takes over Apple. Government breaks up iFlixzon. Qwikster only viable model after internet razing war. </p>
<p><strong>An Offer Netflix Can&#8217;t Refuse</strong><br />
In exchange for rights to stream high quality movies, the studios extracted extraordinary measures from Netflix. </p>
<ol>
<li>Reed Hastings&#8217;s must visit each of the studio heads personally and sing &#8220;I am a little teapot.&#8221;</li>
<li>The studios kidnapped Reed Hastings&#8217;s daughter and if he didn&#8217;t comply they&#8217;d sign her to a three picture deal with Eddie Murphy. </li>
<li>In a fit of Scrabble-induced pique, the studios demanded that Netflix must spin off its DVD by mail service into a new website that uses a Q, W, and K, but only two vowels. </li>
<li>The new site cannot use any of Netflix&#8217;s APIs and must be coded by out-of-work humanities PhDs given an <em>HTML For Dummies</em> book. </li>
<li>Netflix is not allowed to blame or even mention the studios as its rationale for these changes. </li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I watched it on Comedy Central back in the day, and followed it to its new home on the Sci-Fi Channel in the late 1990s. </p>
<p>Heck, I even watched the <em>Mystery Science Theater Hour</em>, which broke episodes up into two-part, 60-minute shows, and I made a trek to an out of town theater to see <em>MST3K: the Movie</em> (1996), which never received a wide release, because the distributor decided to spend its money promoting <em>Barb Wire</em> instead. Yeah.</p>
<p>But, for those uninformed, perhaps I should explain the show: A man (either Joel or Mike depending on the season) is trapped in outer space with his two robot buddies (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot). The trio is forced to watch bad movies &#8212; and they make jokes during the process.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcUkKltAidM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I savored the absurd, random humor, the silly genre films, and let’s be honest, the robot puppets were a draw as well. I spent many hours of my youth, and now of my adult years, watching and re-watching episodes. My collection of episodes on VHS, some taped off TV, traveled with me to college, and then to my post-college life.</p>
<p>Watching shows taped on TV in years past is always a fun walk down memory lane. Remember the collect calling craze of the late 1990s? Commercials with the likes of Carrot Top telling us which service to use are forever stored on my <em>MST3K</em> VHS collection. </p>
<p>Some may chide me for hanging on to such an outdated medium, but due to the nature of <em>MST3K</em> (which had to obtain the rights of the films they lampooned) not every episode is available for (legal) home viewing.</p>
<p>But then &#8212; enter Netflix. </p>
<p>Once I realized I could watch a great quantity of <em>MST3K</em> episodes via Netflix’s Watch Instant service, I was in heaven. I even noted this landmark event with the Internet equivalent of the town crier, Twitter, observing thus: “Episodes of <em>MST3K</em> are now available on Netflix Watch Instant. Clearing my schedule for the next month.”</p>
<p>If my teenage self could see me being able to watch a number of <em>MST3K</em> episodes on demand, without having to fast forward through collect calling commercials featuring Mr. T., he would scream with jealousy. But, after his bout of scream therapy, I would tell Teen Daniel to go and actually talk to a few girls (and to leave the <em>MST3K</em> baseball cap at home for a change).</p>
<p>But where to start when it comes to choosing your own <em>MST3K</em> adventure? I use the website <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles?q=mystery+science+theater+3000&amp;search_episodes=" target="_blank">Instant Watcher</a> to find my titles, as Netflix’s search feature leaves something to be desired. </p>
<p>Here are a few favorites, in no particular order:</p>
<p><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/152252" target="_blank">The Wild World of Batwoman</a>: Buxom avengers in short-shorts and mini-skirts do battle with the vile Rat Fink. This film is pure exploitation cheese. </p>
<p><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/152122" target="_blank">Eegah!</a>:  A giant caveman that time forgot terrorizes teens in dune buggies with stupid haircuts. Watch out for snakes!</p>
<p><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/48328" target="_blank">Horrors of Spider Island</a>: A plane full of leggy dancing girls, along with their sleazebag manager, crash land on an island full of spider puppets. Better still, the film is hilariously dubbed in English, and full of catfights.</p>
<p><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/159827" target="_blank">Cave Dwellers</a>: A shirtless Conan wannabe (the barbarian, not the comedian) fights his way across a land filled with swords, sorcery, and terrible fake mustaches. </p>
<p><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/159829" target="_blank">Pod People</a>: What happens when you throw together an animal obsessed child, a pop singer and his groupies, a group of egg poachers, and a few aliens? I have no idea, but it is called Pod People.</p>
<p><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/164753" target="_blank">Final Sacrifice</a>: One of my all-time favorites from the Sci-Fi Channel years. It is a tale of high adventure in the wild, uncharted forests of Canada. Lost cities, killer cults, hockey hair, and more. This episode introduced <em>MST3K</em> fans to the likes of denim encased Canadian adventurer, Zap Rowsdower. </p>
<p>By watching MST3K over and over, I developed a love of running gags, obscure pop-culture references, and a quick wit of my own—which I put to use as a writer, especially when I write for <a href="http://www.the-losthighway.com/category/reviews-by-tiger-sixon/" target="_blank">Lost Highway’s B-Movie Reviews</a>.</p>
<p>So queue a few episodes, invite some friends over, and partake in the absurd hilarity that is <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In “What Novels Can Do That Films Can’t (And Vice Versa),” Seymour Chatman argues that in film, “the dominant mode is presentational, not assertive. A film doesn’t say, ‘This is the state of affairs,’ it merely shows you that state of affairs.” </p>
<p>Consider a key scene in Vittorio De Sica’s 1948 <em>Ladri di Bicyclette</em> (Bicycle Thieves). Antonio Ricci, the protagonist, takes his wife Maria to pawn their bedsheets, in order to reclaim his in-hock bicycle, which he needs for a new job. The sheets are part of Maria’s trousseau or dowry gift. They’re not Antonio’s to give. </p>
<p>By trading the sheets for the bicycle, the Riccis exchange one overdetermined object for another, belonging to economies separated according to exterior and interior, male and female, future and past. All they share is a common exchange-value. But more is required than just swapping them for money: the objects themselves must be transformed, made as abstract as money itself. </p>
<p>Maria removes the sheets from the bed, washes them, and bundles them up. (“Trousseau” literally means “truss” or “bundle.”) She also negotiates their exchange, and convinces the counter employee to pay 7500 rather than 7000 lire. But this is crucial: they’re not sold. Instead, they’re collateral for a loan, just as Antonio’s bicycle was. The intent is always to buy them back with his new wages.</p>
<p>Antonio has a receipt for his bicycle, and reclaims it from another clerk at another window. As he walks away from the camera to match the number on the receipt with the number on the bicycle, we nearly miss another employee crossing in front. Here the script reads (in English translation): “In the foreground, a man with a bundle of sheets, passes.” We have no way of knowing whether these are Maria’s, although we are asked to associate this scene with the rest of their story. </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6509" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/10/a-broken-world-of-bedsheets-and-bicycles/bicycle-thief/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png" data-orig-size="419,308" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bicycle thief" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=419" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=640" alt="the wall of shelves" title="bicycle thief"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-6509" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png 419w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /> “Pan with him until he reaches a beehive of sheets filled from floor to ceiling with sheets,” the script continues. “With some skill he climbs about half-way up the wall of shelves where he deposits the newly arrived bundle.” </p>
<p>The script does not specify the height or breadth of the wall, or the number of shelves; in the film the wall is preposterously huge, probably thirty feet high. No other set on the film (with the possible exception of the market at the Plaza Vittorio) is nearly as elaborately or dramatically built. The shelves make approximately 3’ by 5’ units that sprawl around the room, extending off-camera in both directions, each crammed with dozens of bundles. </p>
<p>The economic gambit Antonio and Maria have made is simple: exchange the trousseau for the bicycle, the bicycle for the job, which will in turn allow them to reclaim the trousseau. The sheer number of trousseaus is evidence that this economy, like so many of the other economies of misery encountered in the film &#8212; the employment office, the police station, the workers’ guild, the market, the church &#8212; is broken. As Mark West writes, “the whole country seems to have hocked great masses of household goods.” What’s received never adds up to what is paid; victims must track down their own stolen goods, which in turn are brought to market, but never sold. </p>
<p>The size of the wall, especially in contrast to the small, neat row of bicycles, suggests less orderly classification than the impossibility of comprehension. Narrative film collapses into pure photography. The futility of containing the entire shot within the frame, even with a panning camera, mirrors the futility of Antonio and Maria’s situation. It does not matter at all whether the particular bundle being carefully (or not so carefully) stowed away belongs to them. </p>
<p>The personal narrative of pawning the trousseau and reclaiming the bicycle is unmasked as a potentially infinite iteration. There is nothing irreplaceable about this family: the story of <em>Bicycle Thieves</em> could belong to anyone. </p>
<p>Indeed, after the bicycle is stolen, after a fruitless search, Antonio himself is caught at the end of the film stealing a lone bicycle. This is why the film has the plural title <em>Ladri di bicyclette</em>. There isn’t only one thief in the film, but many; not one story of loss, but countless stories that go untold.</p>
<p>In many ways, though, I still prefer the mistranslation <em>Bicycle Thief</em>, which is how you will find the film listed on Netflix, to the more literal <em>Bicycle Thieves</em>. The key is to see it not as a definite reference, but an abstract position anyone might occupy given the right circumstances. </p>
<p>There are no collective nouns &#8212; just a series of isolated and interchangable parts. That’s the story Antonio’s bicycle and Maria’s bedsheets tell in their own fragmented way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix instant viewing has been both a blessing and a curse for an indecisive movie fan like me. Finally the video store has come to your living room and I, for one, am a bit overwhelmed. Sometimes, I’ll lose a whole hour of my life to aimlessly scanning the catalogue finding myself attracted to so many movies of so many genres, that I don’t know what to pick. I’ve seen some interesting things via instant viewing in the last year, some old and some new. Below is a list of the five most interesting flicks I saw via Netflix in 2010. Here’s hoping that 2011 yields some similar finds.</p>
<ul>
<li><img data-attachment-id="2862" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/07/the-netflix-b-list/yakuza_ver3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg" data-orig-size="499,755" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="yakuza_ver3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=198" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=499" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150" alt="Yakuza" title="yakuza_ver3" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2862" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300 198w" sizes="(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px" /> <em>The Yakuza</em> (1975)
<p>Michigan’s own Paul Schrader set a Hollywood record by selling the script for this neo-noir for a cool $325,000, a record at the time. Tough guy Robert Mitchum plays Harry Kilmer, a retired detective who heads to Japan to rescue the daughter of an old friend, who has gotten caught up in the Yakuza aka the Japanese Mafia. This is a tough flick that features some pretty heavy and complex themes but doesn’t skimp on the action. The finale featuring Mitchum storming a dojo full of sword-wielding henchmen with a shotgun in one hand and a revolver in the other is the stuff that pulp fiction is made of.</li>
<li><img data-attachment-id="2863" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/07/the-netflix-b-list/the-plague-dogs-front/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-plague-dogs-front.jpg" data-orig-size="512,736" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="the plague dogs front" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-plague-dogs-front.jpg?w=209" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-plague-dogs-front.jpg?w=512" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-plague-dogs-front.jpg?w=104&#038;h=150" alt="The Plague Dogs" title="the plague dogs front" width="104" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2863" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-plague-dogs-front.jpg?w=104&amp;h=150 104w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-plague-dogs-front.jpg?w=208&amp;h=300 208w" sizes="(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px" /> <em>The Plague Dogs</em> (1985)
<p>From the makers of that <em>Watership Down</em> cartoon that creeped you out as a kid, comes another weighty and disturbing animated film about the politics of the animal kingdom.  Rowf and Snitter are two dogs who escape from an animal research facility only to find themselves not only ill-prepared and shell-shocked by the realities of nature but hunted by their former captors as well. This is a film that opens with a dog drowning during some macabre experiment so that sets the tone right there. As depressing as it is, <em>The Plague Dogs</em> is an emotional and fascinating movie. It’s interesting to see animation used to tell a truly adult story (and not in a Ralph Bakshi adult way). The sullen voice work by the likes of John Hurt only adds to the somber tone. Be sure to give your dog a couple of extra hugs after watching this one.</li>

<p>Have you heard of this before? I can’t say I truly <em>recommend</em> this movie, but you have to see it!</p>
<p>John Boorman followed up his <em>Deliverance</em> (1972) success with this bizarre and off-putting sci-fi flick. In the post-apocalyptic future (of course), life is fairly primitive and Zardoz, a large stone head that floats through the air, preaches his own updated gospel, which goes a little something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2865" style="width: 133px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2865" data-attachment-id="2865" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/07/the-netflix-b-list/zardoz-2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg" data-orig-size="496,603" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="zardoz-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=247" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=496" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=123&#038;h=150" alt="Sean Connery" title="zardoz-2" width="123" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2865" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=123&amp;h=150 123w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=246&amp;h=300 246w" sizes="(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2865" class="wp-caption-text">You know you want to click and see the full-size image</p></div> The gun is good. The penis is evil. The penis shoots seeds, and makes new life to poison the Earth with a plague of men, as once it was, but the gun shoots death, and purifies the Earth of the filth of brutals. Go forth . . . and kill!</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, Sean Connery runs around the whole film in a red diaper and a ponytail and the film gets more and more incomprehensible as it goes along. And it’s all so damn serious! This one is seriously strange and it’s hard to believe that Connery or Boorman could have done this with a straight face. This is alcohol-required viewing.</li>

Hardy gives a fearless and remarkable performance as the titular character, Britain’s most notorious prisoner. Charlie Bronson has spent 35 years behind bars, at least 30 of which were in solitary confinement. Bronson is such a fascinating character and Hardy plays him with such gusto that you are liable to get as lost in the character as Hardy does. It’s a raw and harsh flick and not for the squeamish but Hardy is a revelation here.</li>

In Ancient Rome, the famed Ninth Legion finds itself decimated after an ambush by enemy forces, leaving only a few survivors trapped deep behind enemy lines.  Think of it as <em>The Warriors</em> in ancient Rome as the ragtag group desperately try to make it home. There are more beheadings, slit throats, and dismemberments than <em>Gladiator</em> and <em>Braveheart</em> combined (if you’re into that sort of thing&mdash;and I know I am!) and the brisk pace and solid production values make this one exciting flick.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s 2011.  Another year bites the dust.  The last thing the world needs is another &#8220;best films of the year&#8221; list, right?  Every film site has one, not to mention the &#8220;official&#8221; lists compiled by SAG, The Hollywood Foreign Press and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (the later of which is <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2009/06/24/2010-oscars-to-have-10-best-picture-nominees/">far too long</a>, but more on that later).  And here I am, too far behind on Hollywood’s current block of must-see films (as usual) to make a best of the year list, and staring at the ranks of my wrap-around-the-block Netflix instant queue, sixty and counting.  Where do I begin?  What’s a fella to do?   It is certainly important to remain current, but my sofa is already under my butt, after all, and my PS3 controller is within reach.</p>
<p>Netflix it is. </p>
<p>At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I don’t know what I’d do without Netflix instant streaming.  As an avid consumer of media, an entertainment glutton, Netflix streaming has become my all-you-can-eat buffet.  Its rapidly growing back catalog has nearly caused me to collapse under the weight of my own excitement and intimidation.  You may recall my post-holiday wish list, wherein I mention my desire to freeze time so that I can catch up on <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/01/the-cinephiles-christmas-list/">EVERY FILM EVER MADE</a> without losing any time?  Well, Netflix can do little about time&mdash;which makes fools of us all&mdash;but they can begin to steadily catalog every film, making them easily accessible from the comfort of my aforementioned sofa.  Netflix is going to make me a film guru. . . and fat and lazy.  That’s okay because people come to gurus, not the other way around.  But I digress.</p>
<p>Since I have spent far more time on Netflix this year than in a theater I have decided to create a very specific “best-of” list in lieu of your standard bit of business.  And so, in no particular order, here is a list of my favorite films viewed in 2010&mdash;but probably made years before&mdash;and viewed for the first time on Netflix instant streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Cropsey" src="https://i0.wp.com/cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2010/06/10/1276186975_5524/539w.jpg" alt="" width="323" height="194" /> <strong><em>Cropsey</em> (2009)<br />
Streamed on 11/04/10</strong></p>
<p>Filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio explore the origins of the childhood Boogeyman they dubbed “Cropsey,” and discover direct links to a real life boogeyman named Andre Rand, who may or may not be responsible for multiple child murders on Staten Island. </p>
<p>It has everything you’d want from a compelling documentary and everything you’d expect from a great horror film.  As the two filmmakers delve deeper into Rand’s case, things become more and more surreal.  I won’t spoil the film with any of the details but, suffice it to say, truth is stranger than fiction.  In this case, it’s also scarier.</li>
<li><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Cloudy with a chance of meatballs" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.blogcdn.com/blog.moviefone.com/media/2009/07/cloudycine1.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="163" /> <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em> (2009)<br />
Streamed on 09/25/10</strong></p>
<p>In the world of computer-animated fare Pixar will always reign supreme, but in 2009 Sony Pictures took a tiny step out of Pixar&#8217;s epic shadow with this one.  Sure, it may not be quite as sophisticated, but it’s damned funny, relatively clever and pretty as hell to look at.  Add in some great voice acting from Bill Hader (underrated), Anna Faris and James Caan and you’ve really got something.  Seriously, I’m surprised I liked this as much as I did too!</li>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Terribly Happy" src="https://i1.wp.com/kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2010/04/08/Terribly_Happy_4_t614.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="245" /> <strong><em>Terribly Happy</em> (2008)<br />
Streamed on 7/16/10</strong></p>
<p>In the time-honored tradition of conveying style via hypothetical copulations I shall declare this film to be the product of David Lynch and Coen brothers coital interactions on Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s sofa.  Wha?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, this is a fantastically strange, dark little Danish film<a href="#note1">*</a> about a Copenhagen cop banished to a small town after being involved in a bit of shadiness I shall not divulge here.  His attempts to start anew are eventually foiled by unwelcoming townsfolk who like to dump their “problems” into a local bog, a little girl who keeps pushing around a squeaky, empty baby carriage in the middle of the night, and his own psychosis.</li>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="It might get loud" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.forgetthebox.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/it-might-get-loud-jam-460-100-460-70.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="207" /> <strong><em>It Might Get Loud</em> (2008)<br />
Streamed on 10/06/10</strong></p>
<p>Oh man, is this a music nerd&#8217;s dream or what?  Jack White, The Edge and Jimmy Page hangin’, jammin’ and talkin’ axes.  Simple and sweet.</p>
<p>There is a bit of weirdness involving Jack White jamming with a child version of himself, but it’s more than made up for with the film&#8217;s killer intro, in which White constructs a makeshift guitar out of a coke bottle, some wire and a wooden plank.  Now <em>that’s</em> rock and roll.</li>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Spartan" src="https://i1.wp.com/content7.flixster.com/rtmovie/22/24/22249_gal.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="260" /> <strong><em>Spartan</em> (2004)<br />
Streamed on 3/27/10</strong></p>
<p>There is no getting around it. David Mamet’s dialog is fast, smart, and sharp as a tack.  I enjoy the hell out of it regardless of the quality of the film it’s in (<em>Redbelt</em> is a bit of a sloppy mess). </p>
<p>If pressed I would admit that you simply cannot beat <em>Glengary Glen Ross</em> (1992) for killer Mamet dialog, but <em>Spartan’s</em> got a coolness factor that shouldn’t be denied.  Take, for example, this bit of machismo dialog:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What they gotcha teaching here, young sergeant?”</p>
<p>“Edged weapons, sir.  Knife fighting”</p>
<p>“Don’t you teach ‘em knife fighting.  Teach ‘em to kill.  That way, they meet some sonofabitch who studied knife fighting, they send his soul to hell.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Bam.</li>
</ul>
<p>—</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<em>Chappelle's Show</em> is a strange hybrid. The cinematic clips uproot it from the live experience, but the recorded audience pulls it back down again. The big laughs are all things that a 2004 audience found funny or shocking. And some of them just aren't that funny or shocking any more.

On top of this, so many of Chappelle's sketches have become comedy classics that it's hard to genuinely find them surprising anymore. "I'm Rick James, bitch!" was hilarious. Then your mom's skeezy brother said it ten times at one holiday party a year after the show aired, and it didn't feel so funny anymore.

<em>Chappelle's Show</em> also gets bound up with what we know about Dave Chappelle's history afterward. Dave famously quit the show because he felt that he was creatively tapped and was increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that jokes he'd intended as racial satire were getting laughed at for their silly, minstrelsy qualities. He even felt that his co-creators were complicit in this—he no longer felt comfortable working with them, so after recording several sketches for a much-anticipated third season, he briefly disappeared. There were rumors about his mental health and the possibility of drug abuse. Nobody could seem to grasp that somebody so successful didn't like what he was doing anymore.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally figured out what had been bothering me about rewatching <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> on Netflix.</p>
<p>It was the laughter.</p>

Dave and his partners would write and perform prerecorded sketches, then Dave would show them to a live audience. A few shows, like <em>Saturday Night Live</em> or <em>The Daily Show</em>, do this for a handful of sketches. On <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em>, that was the entire show.</p>
<p>When it worked, it was fantastic. Sketches on <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> were downright cartoonish—Dave could get punched so hard that he&#8217;d flip end over end like Daffy Duck, or crap so hard that he would launch off the toilet bowl like a rocket ship. (An understated allusion to a legendary lost Marvin the Martian short.) They were surprising and cinematic, and the live audience would register that. And when Dave&#8217;s sense of humor was shocking or childish or startlingly truthful, the audience would register that, too.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that recording a live audience freezes a show in time. If you&#8217;re watching a movie, let&#8217;s say an older but still-contemporary-feeling comedy, like Woody Allen&#8217;s <em>Annie Hall</em>, you can laugh at whatever you like; the clichés that might have killed in 1977 just wash over you. The same is true of animated shows like <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Futurama</em>, or <em>King of the Hill</em>.</p>
<p>The live audience is really an artifact of the live, three-camera sitcom—think <em>I Love Lucy</em>, <em>The Cosby Show</em>, or <em>Seinfeld</em>. When sitcoms went single-camera and were edited together like movies—think <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>, <em>The Bernie Mac Show</em>, <em>Arrested Development</em>, <em>The Office</em>, or <em>30 Rock</em>— they gave up on the live audience AND the laugh track.</p>
<p>So <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> is a strange hybrid. The cinematic clips uproot it from that live experience, but the recorded audience pulls it back down again. The big laughs are all things that a 2004 audience found funny or shocking. And some of them just aren&#8217;t that funny or shocking six years after the fact.</p>
<p>On top of this, so many of Chappelle&#8217;s sketches have become comedy classics that it&#8217;s hard to genuinely find them surprising. &#8220;I&#8217;m Rick James, bitch!&#8221; was hilarious. Then your mom&#8217;s skeezy brother said it ten times at one holiday party a year after the show aired, and it didn&#8217;t feel so funny.</p>
<p><em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> also gets bound up with what we know about Dave Chappelle&#8217;s history afterward. Dave famously quit the show because he felt that he was creatively tapped and was increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that jokes he&#8217;d intended as racial satire were getting laughed at for their silly, minstrelsy qualities. He even felt that his co-creators were complicit in this—he no longer felt comfortable working with them, so after recording several sketches for a much-anticipated third season, he briefly disappeared. There were rumors about his mental health and the possibility of drug abuse. Nobody could seem to grasp that somebody so successful didn&#8217;t like what he was doing anymore.</p>
<p>They should have seen the signs. An unusual number of sketches—even some whole episodes—are devoted to Dave&#8217;s fantasy of quitting his successful show. In one long riff, Dave finds out he&#8217;s impregnated Oprah Winfrey, so he spectacularly quits his show, punching out Comedy Central staffers and pulling down cubicles. Of course, it turns out Dave isn&#8217;t really the father, so he&#8217;s stuck without a job OR Oprah&#8217;s money.</p>

This episode along with the Charlie Murphy/Rick James episode were probably the most famous from the second season, so I feel pretty comfortable spoiling its conceit for you. Wayne Brady, despite his smiling, singing exterior, turns out to be a gun-toting, drug-dealing pimp and murderer.</p>
<p>I watched the episode for about twenty minutes before I remembered that it was a parody of the Denzel Washington movie <em>Training Day</em>. Do you remember Denzel in <em>Training Day</em>? I kinda do&#8230; but I know I remember Wayne Brady spoofing Denzel&#8217;s performance more. And even Wayne Brady isn&#8217;t the same guy he used to be. Between <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> and appearances on <em>30 Rock</em>, <em>Girlfriends</em>, and elsewhere, he&#8217;s more than just the singing guy from <em>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</em> But he&#8217;s also hosting <em>Let&#8217;s Make A Deal</em>. It&#8217;s weird.</p>
<p>The things I found the funniest were jokes that nobody laughed at—little inside references that you have to pick up by watching the show several episodes in a clip, or strange, timeless jokes. For instance, in the Rick James episode, Charlie Murphy relates how he and his brother beat Rick after he&#8217;d dragged mud-stained boots over Eddie&#8217;s couch. Charlie remembers Eddie saying, &#8220;Wow, Rick really needs help&#8230;&#8221; Only for Charlie to come back, &#8220;Yo, we just GAVE him some help!&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing topical about it; it&#8217;s a joke that I&#8217;m sure was funny when Charlie told it in 1984, and it&#8217;s funny today.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that Comedy Central drove Chappelle&#8217;s formula into the ground, first with blatantly offensive ethnic comedians with infinitely less talent (I&#8217;m looking at you, Carlos Mencia) and then with the sometimes-funny, frequently-embarassing &#8220;Lost Episodes&#8221; from what would have been <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> Season 3. If the live-presentation formula is cumbersome with Dave presenting sketches, it&#8217;s positively uncomfortable when Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings try to stand in Dave&#8217;s place. They make awkward jokes, usually at Dave&#8217;s expense, give an excessively literal and thoroughly clumsy summary of the sketch we&#8217;re about to see, then throw it up on the screen.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t good moments in these third-season sketches. My favorite is, in a weird way, a kind of self-commentary on the postmortem nature of the show—<a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=71416&amp;title=tupac-is-still-alive" target="new">an extended joke about Tupac Shakur&#8217;s posthumous records</a>.</p>
<p>Dave is in the club, dancing with a crowd, listening to one of these unreleased Tupac recordings, when Tupac starts making references to events after his death, like George W. Bush&#8217;s election, then covering it over with lines like &#8220;when I say George W, I mean a George W. Smith, for city council here in Oakland&#8230; you probably didn&#8217;t hear about it.&#8221; The chorus for the song turns out to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wrote this song a long time ago<br />
A real long time ago<br />
Feel me!<br />
I wrote this song a long time ago<br />
It was the dopest song I ever wrote<br />
In &#8217;94</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the club starts exchanging strange looks, until Tupac&#8217;s lyrics begin to start commenting on the appearance and behavior of everyone there. &#8220;Go home!&#8221; Tupac tells Dave. &#8220;I&#8217;m not alive!&#8221;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="395" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/09/when-the-laughter-stopped/attachment/01/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg" data-orig-size="480,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="0[1]" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=480" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Dave Chappelle" title="0[1]" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-395" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />To me, that says so much about what&#8217;s still funny, but also a little creepy, about watching <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> in 2010. <em>A joke about Tupac being alive? Didn&#8217;t that get old when I was still in high school? </em></p>
<p>But Dave Chappelle is our comedy Tupac. He wasn&#8217;t shot (except by Wayne Brady in that sketch), but he vanished just as quickly. He did so much, so fast, that we forgive him for the times that he wasn&#8217;t so great, and are willing to accept the dribs and drabs, the poorly-edited outtakes, because it&#8217;s all we have left. And we&#8217;re still waiting for word that he just might still be around, under the radar, without an audience, working on something great.</p>
<p>The audience&#8217;s laughter bothers me. It was what bothered Dave, too, so much that he left it all behind when he was still on top.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The decade's five best, most influential comedies are all on Netflix's "Watch Instantly" online streaming service. What are the odds?

In this short series, I'm going to watch each of them&#8212;notice I'm using the future tense, even though I've totally gone back and watched all of these&#8212;and pick them off and break them down one by one. How have they held up? What do we learn about them (and about us) by rewatching them? I'll also pull in some additional commentary&#8212;some from earlier in the decade, some later&#8212;that helps offer some perspective on (re)watching these series. And I'll definitely be letting you know what I think, offering my take on how we got here.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Gavin and Kev asked me to write something about pop culture, I knew exactly what I wanted my column to be about: old TV. Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, BitTorrent, iTunes, Amazon, DVDs, old cassette tapes I recorded as a kid &#8212; I eat it all up.</p>
<p>The stars have aligned. The last decade&#8217;s five best, most influential comedies are all on Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Watch Instantly&#8221; online streaming service.</p>
<p>I know. You&#8217;re guessing. For the record, here are the five I&#8217;m thinking of, in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Futurama</em></li>
<li><em>The Office</em> (UK)</li>
<li><em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em></li>
<li><em>Arrested Development</em></li>
<li><em>30 Rock</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, yes: a complete list of the decade&#8217;s best comedies would have to include (definitely) <em>The Daily Show</em> and (probably) <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>. But <em>The Daily Show</em> is available on <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/">Comedy Central&#8217;s own competing site</a>, and HBO holds on to their original series like they&#8217;re money. Because they are.</p>
<p>This is the best Netflix could do. Once you add in <em>South Park</em>,<em> King of the Hill</em>, the US/Steve Carell version of <em>The Office</em>, and terrific runs of older classics like <em>SNL</em>, <em>Monty Python</em>, and <em>Soap</em>, plus cult hits like <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> and the <em>Kids in the Hall</em> pilot, you&#8217;re talking a serious stash of the funny.</p>
<p>Out of this shortlist, besides the just-now-airing new episodes of <em>Futurama</em>, <em>30 Rock</em> is the only show that doesn&#8217;t have the entire series available online. (Once Season 5 starts airing, I bet we&#8217;ll see Season 4 in the queue too.) And even though it&#8217;s probably the most universally well-regarded sitcom on TV now &#8212; it&#8217;s definitely my favorite &#8212; in terms of influence and originality, <em>30 Rock</em> is fifth out of five. I love the show, I could quote and rewatch it endlessly, but you could make a good case that all it&#8217;s really done is mix and match elements of the other four. Liz Lemon is equal parts Michael Bluth and Turanga Leela, with a dash of Homer Simpson. We get to watch her spin her wheels in her workplace, which is filled with dweebs, losers, cartoons, and ethnic stereotypes. Sounding familiar?</p>

<p>Odds are, if you&#8217;re a fan at all, you probably remember most of these episodes of <em>30 Rock</em> pretty well. Or you&#8217;re trying/hoping to catch up. Even if you don&#8217;t watch the show, you know a lot about it; your friends watch it, you see commercials, it&#8217;s still in the atmosphere. But with any of the other four comedies, it&#8217;s likely that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>You saw them and enjoyed them, but don&#8217;t remember any of the episodes well beyond a few big moments;</li>
<li>You heard about them and maybe wanted to watch, or watch more often, but wound up missing them altogether;</li>
<li>They&#8217;re your favorite comedy ever, you&#8217;ve memorized your favorite episodes, and you&#8217;re delighted that someone is finally asking you to talk about them rather than begging you to stop; OR</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t like any of them. In which case, I don&#8217;t like you. Get the hell out of here and go watch Season 3 of <em>Heroes</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this short series, I&#8217;m going to watch* and write about each of them, picking them off and breaking them down one by one.</p>
<p>*Notice I&#8217;m using the future tense for &#8220;watch&#8221;, even though I&#8217;ve totally gone back and watched all of these and am already on my second run through <em>Arrested Development</em>.</p>
<p>How have these shows held up? What do we learn about them (and about us) by rewatching them?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also pull in some additional commentary—some from earlier in the decade, contemporary with these show&#8217;s airdates, and some from later—that can give us some perspective while (re)watching these series.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll definitely be letting you know what I think, offering my take on how we got here.</p>
<p>But in this first post, just to set the stage, and so everyone knows the baseline we&#8217;re starting from, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to you in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;ve never seen / are a total geek for one of them, out yourselves.</li>
<li>What do you remember or not remember, like or dislike in these shows?</li>
<li>Where would <em>you</em> rank them?</li>
<li>Also—where would the 2004 version of yourself rank them?</li>
</ul>
<p>As we&#8217;ve changed, the world&#8217;s changed, and comedy&#8217;s changed, this turns out to be a more meaningful question that you might think.</p>
