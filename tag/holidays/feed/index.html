										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the book world you can expect certain books to be published at certain times. January is full of self-help, diet, and exercise books for all those people making New Year’s resolutions. Summer sees loads of mysteries and an uptick in fiction for women, books about sisters and friends with images of women on beaches or in fields on the cover. I always felt that in the fall a lot of biographies and histories were published, kids need something to buy dad for Christmas. </p>
<p>Late November is the season for Christmas books. I’m not talking about holiday craft and recipe books, or books like the Mark Twain bio that are expected to be big sellers for the holidays. I’m referring to the romance and mystery books set in “Christmastime.” For romance books it’s a time when families and friends come together, experience some minor stresses, meet a handsome stranger or reencounter an old flame, and have everything end happily ever after. The mysteries generally have the main character’s attempt at happy holidays destroyed by murders and other crimes. </p>
<p>James Patterson’s Christmas book is one of his Alex Cross books, <em>Merry Christmas, Alex Cross</em>. The publisher’s description: It&#8217;s Christmas Eve and Detective Alex Cross is called away from his family to resolve a horrific hostage situation that is spiraling out of control. Really? Did this have to be set around Christmas? I doubt that the time of year plays into the plot much. Hostage situations with a Christmas tree or two, maybe some carols playing on a radio in the background. I feel like Patterson could have written a manuscript, realized the book would have a late fall release date and decided to throw in some Christmas related bits.</p>
<p>Romance writer Mary Balogh’s 2012 Christmas book is a republishing of two novellas, <em>A Christmas Bride/Christmas Beau</em>. This seems like a case of a publisher insisting the author have a new Christmas book so the author rummaged around in their older works for a few holiday stories. It frustrates me that people will buy anything Christmasy this time of year. Throw a red and green cover on a book and people will fall over themselves to buy it. Blue and white covers work too. Time to make money off the masses.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t call myself a Christian, the hyped up consumerism this time of year does bother me. I feel as though people will buy anything if they are told it will make their holidays brighter or happier. Generally the romance books are not purchased as gifts, from what I remember being in the book selling business. Women buy them to leave their real holiday stress behind and escape to snow covered Montana where handsome farm hands are home for the holidays and meet striking women, or sweet suburbs have twinkling lights and new neighbors who need a fall in love over a plate of gingerbread cookies. It’s not how Christmas really happens, although I suppose this feeling goes back to my general derision of romance novels in general. </p>
<p>The Christmas mysteries are purchased as gifts about as often as not. People seem to enjoy reading about CIA operatives and detectives running about trying to solve crimes and trim the tree at the same time. I’m not sure where the appeal is, murder around the holidays has to be more stressful than your average family get-together. Maybe people like reading about situations that make a lazy brother who “forgot” to get a hotel room or screaming nieces and nephews in matching sweaters a little less awful.</p>
<p>I will give a few exceptions to my general fussiness over Christmas books. Author Debbie Macomber seems to truly love Christmas. She has written a Christmas book every year since the late 1990s. It’s kind of adorable. Her website extolls her love of the holidays and writing the books is a tradition for her. She seems to have found a soft spot in my grinchy outlook. If someone loves this holiday season, I think it shows in their work. Richard Paul Evans seems to have an understanding of the holiday spirit as well. You’ve probably heard of his books, <em>The Christmas Box</em>, <em>The Timepiece</em>, and <em>Lost December</em> to name a few. He has written a Christmas book every year for the past decade or so as well. He has the feel good market well covered.</p>
<p>Even these books make me roll my eyes a bit. Why can’t they take place during other times of the year? Why does winter have to equal Christmas? It’s exhausting. I don’t want to be a Grinch, but the forced holiday cheer gets to me, especially when it starts immediately after Halloween. Thanksgiving gets a small window to shine and then it’s buy buy buy. Christmas books feed into this frenzy of holiday craziness and that puts them on my naughty list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I forget that I’m a grownup. I still feel like I’m only 21. Every now and then, something will remind me that I’m no longer the target audience for Ke$ha’s music. This week I had drinks with someone born in 1990. I get cranky about the music that’s popular—why is it all club music? KIDS THESE DAYS. Most of the time, I’d rather just stay home and read a book with a cold beer, instead of taking all that time to make myself look good enough to compete with the young whippersnappers when I go out.</p>
<p>But it’s not all dentures and rocking chairs. On Saturday night, I went with Charlie to his work holiday party. As an undergraduate, work parties were awkward affairs in the break room, with the background music of a jamming printer and someone mowing the lawn outside of the basement-level windows. We sat as far away from each other as possible to avoid accidentally bumping elbows or knees with someone, staying only long enough to be polite, eat a piece of cake, and get the hell out of there.</p>
<p>Even after I went off to the corporate world, our work Christmas party was held in the back room of a bowling alley. When we came in, we were ushered past the bar, the pool tables, and the bowling lanes, into a tiny, dark room with an apathetic woman tending bar in a stained white shirt. The party budget covered an open bar, some standard fried food, and unlimited cold pizza, but did not cover bowling or pool. Apparently the bowling lanes were just for show. As a fun alternative, we were all forced to sit on Santa’s lap and take photographs. My friends and I went to the bar afterward to forget what had just happened. It was a slight improvement over my previous work parties, but only in the way that a filling is an improvement over a root canal.</p>
<p>But, dear readers, getting older just means learning how to party more effectively. Charlie’s work party was no joke. It was disco themed, but I’m as bad at themes as I am at costumes, so I chose to ignore that and wore an open-backed top with enough cleavage to say that I’m fun but not so much that Charlie’s friends would think I was a hussy.</p>
<p>When we got to the party, we had to wait in line for a bouncer to let us in. A bouncer. That was my first clue that, even though this was held in their office building, this would not be a party in the fluorescent-lit break room with mediocre cake. No it would not. After we checked in and checked our coats, we went straight for the bar, which was already overflowing with pre-mixed drinks, beer, and wine. The building was full of women in short, sequined dresses and men in platform shoes. Tents were set up outside with strings of lights, couches with neon pillows around fire pits, and women in pink costumes handing out rave jewelry and candy. Charlie’s company clearly values their employees more than mine did.</p>
<p>And the food. Let me tell you about the food. In one room was Japanese, in another was fancy vegetable dishes, some sort of strange fish paste that looked like mashed potatoes, gourmet mac and cheese, meatballs, and many other fresh-made things that I was too wide-eyed to really notice. Some party regulars thought it was nothing special, but I was like a fucking country bumpkin at a five-star restaurant. I was mostly too anxious to eat. Food at social events like this always gives me so much anxiety. Why serve gigantic slabs of chicken without knives? Am I supposed to eat it with my fingers? How can I eat this macaroni and cheese with a fork while I’m also trying to carry my drink? Do I have anything in my teeth? Why is everyone else so much more graceful at this sort of thing than I am? In the end, I decided to avoid the potential for screwups entirely and save my appetite for the dessert tent.</p>
<p>Guys, you have never seen a dessert tent like this. It was set up like a set from Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Everything was edible. There was another bar serving champagne floats with lemon sorbet. Big pink lollipops hung from the ceiling. Charlie and I drunkenly cut the line for the chocolate fountain. I chose a cheesecake lollipop (a tiny piece of chocolate-covered cheesecake on a stick) for the fountain, and was too impatient to let the chocolate harden, so I promptly dripped it all over my cleavage, arms, and feet. I found bits of chocolate on me all night long.</p>
<p>Each room had its own bar. Our work parties were all grown up. We closed out the night dancing to a band recreating all the bad pop songs in a room hung with disco balls where hired girls in afro wigs danced on tables. We’re not quite grown up yet.</p>

<div style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Leg Lamp" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.geardiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/christmas-story-lamp-leg1.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="194" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mmmmm... Leg lamp</p></div>
<p>Odds are you’re at least somewhat familiar with Bob Clark’s holiday classic <em>A Christmas Story (1983).  </em>It usually starts airing sometime around the end of Thanksgiving and continues on through Christmas morning every year.  Seriously, it’s always on.  Because of this (and because it’s a pretty great Christmas movie) it has managed to worm its way into our holiday consciousness.  Nearly everyone remembers <em>something</em> about the film, if not its entirety.  Perhaps the “queen mother of dirty words”?  Or the triple dog dare that leads to poor Flick getting his tongue stuck to a flagpole?  The leg lamp?  Oh, that leg lamp.  It was kind of hot, no?  Ah, to be a kid again.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Black Christmas" src="https://i0.wp.com/horrorsnotdead.com/images/black_christmas_74.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="315" /> <em>A Christmas Story</em> could be considered Bob Clark’s masterpiece, despite the fact that he gave us <em>Porky’s 1 &amp; 2 (1982 &amp; 1983) </em>in addition to starting his career on the high note that is <em>She-man (1967), </em>which is about a “soldier forced to take estrogen and wear lingerie after being blackmailed by a violent transvestite.”  They should show <em>that</em> every Christmas!  But <em>A Christmas Story</em> isn’t Bob Clark’s only foray into holiday territory.  In fact, it’s not even his first.  In 1974 Mr. Clark brought us a film that would help shape the slasher genre as we know it today: <em>Black Christmas</em>.  As a slasher film, it&#8217;s top notch, with scares that still hold up today.  As a Christmas film, well, that’s a matter of taste.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Eye" src="https://i0.wp.com/actionflickchick.com/superaction/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/black-christmas-the-eye.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="199" />A group of sorority girls are hosting a Christmas party when a deranged and disoriented man (not a frat member) climbs into their open attic window.  Soon they begin receiving creepy (super creepy) phone calls.  Some seem like inane babbling.  Some contain inhuman sounds.  The calls become increasingly threatening and bizarre, and it’s not long before the man begins creatively dispatching the girls one by one.  They’d be lucky to get a BB in the eye!  Speaking of eyes, that’s all you’ll ever see of this mouth breathing, Christmas-hating jerky boy.  Chilling shots of his lecherous eye peering through cracks and holes in the wall, lit with a spotlight.  Couple that with the calls and you’ve got the makings of one serious boogieman!  Ho, ho, ho. </p>
<p>Perhaps this year I’ll have a nice little Bob Clark Christmas?  <em>A Christmas Story</em> followed by <em>Black Christmas? </em> Or, if I’m ambitious, a bizarre, re-edited mash-up?  You Tube, here I come!</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>
