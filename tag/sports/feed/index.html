										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the twenty-four years I’ve been playing video games, I think I’ve become pretty well rounded. Platformers, RPGs, shooters, puzzlers, text-only, you name it &#8212; I’ve tried it. There is one chink in my armor, though, and it’s sports games.</p>
<p>My cousin was the only one in the family with a Super Nintendo growing up. I skipped that particular Nintendo console since I was embroiled in an ill-fated affair with the Sega CD, so I was always interested in playing it whenever I went to my aunt’s house. The only games my cousin had were <i>Madden</i> and <i>NHL ’96</i>. I had no idea what I was doing, and my cousin was having too much fun pummeling the noob to stop and give me tips. Thus began my hatred of sports games. I haven’t touched one since.</p>
<p>In the interest of bettering myself, I decided to seek out a sports gamer and get his or her perspective on the genre. Maybe then I could begin strengthening my gaming weakness. Fortunately, my friend Brandon Kelley was just the guy I was looking for, and sat down with me to discuss his gaming history and the finer points of the <i>FIFA</i> franchise.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Do you need me to spell my name for the record?</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> You’re not on trial here, sir.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> We’ll see!</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So, something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is how I have certain holes in my gaming experience, and as a games writer I feel like I shouldn’t have any. But I just can’t get into sports games! You’re the only person I know who plays sports games regularly.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Right, right, and with the first-person shooters you at least try to play them but you’re just not any good.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Well, I’m getting better because of <i>Mass Effect</i>, which is third-person, but I’ve found I’ve been able to translate skills. I’ll never be good enough for multiplayer, but then a lot of people aren’t. But first let me ask you a couple questions about your gaming experience in general: how long have you been playing video games?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I vaguely remember when I was a small boy, for Christmas, my family got the Atari &#8212; I can’t remember if it was the 2600 or the 5200 &#8212; it was whichever one they stopped making games for maybe two years after it came out. And my dad was really into it and he would play it with my brother and me. My brother’s three years older than me. We’d play <i>Breakout</i>, which you know is very similar to that game everybody plays on their Blackberry. And we also played this game called <i>Bounty Bob</i> or <i>Miner 2049er</i>, and it was kind of a rip off of <i>King Kong</i> where you played this little miner who had a mustache. Or at least it looked like he had a mustache.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Wait, <i>King Kong</i> or <i>Donkey Kong</i>?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Uh, <i>Donkey Kong</i>.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I’m a real gamer.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> (laughs) Hey, there could be a game that’s licensed to <i>King Kong</i> that I don’t know about.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11171" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/10/the-sport-of-youth-and-fashion-of-the-age/pic1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic1.jpg" data-orig-size="640,392" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pic1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic1.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=392" alt="platformer" width="640" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11171" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic1.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Uh, no, definitely not. But the object of the game with <i>Bounty Bob</i> was that there was a course with various platforms and ladders like <i>Donkey Kong</i>, and as your guy walked over the platform it filled in with color. You just basically had to traverse all of the platforms, and then you’d move on to the next level.</p>
<p>So, post-Atari we got our first personal computer as a family. I was about ten so this would have been the late eighties, and there was a game that sort of lit me up called <i>Freddy’s Rescue Roundup</i>. Did you ever play this game?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> It was similar to <i>Bounty Bob</i> where you were this little guy Freddy and you’d just make him jump with the spacebar, and you’d have to collect all these pigeons throughout the course. I remember always stealing away to the basement where the computer was to play <i>Freddy’s Rescue Roundup </i>and listen to the radio for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Then there was the Super Nintendo, and that was when I would say you could really call me a “gamer.” The Super Nintendo was bought for both my brother and me for Christmas, but he never played it. I played it all the time. <i>Street Fighter II</i>, <i>Super Mario World</i>, with the cape. I remember the day I got 100% completion on <i>Super Mario World</i>. That was huge.</p>
<p>Leading into sports games, I can remember having two sports games that I played on the SNES: <i>NBA Jam</i> &#8212; “He’s heating up! He’s on fire!” &#8212; and then there was a game called <i>Super Soccer Champ</i>. <i>Super Soccer Champ</i> was a sports arcade game, as opposed to a sports simulator, which is a distinction that will be important when we’re talking about <i>FIFA</i>. But I’d play that game with my buddy Kevin cooperatively, as opposed to facing off, which was pretty novel at the time.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Did you play sports in real life at all?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yeah. I played soccer when a little kid in the local township leagues, and I continued to play through high school. I was a letterman.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Nice. So you were good at soccer in real life, then.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Well, I was good enough to play in high school. (laughs) I was passionate about soccer, but I wasn’t good enough to explore that passion through my own athleticism. What’s exciting about getting into the simulation aspect of <i>FIFA</i> is that games like that allow you as a fan and former player to exercise your brain &#8212; your tactical sports brain &#8212; and see the fruits of that tactical awareness on the screen, when you physically can’t achieve that.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Would you say that the primary reason you play video games in general is to achieve that kind of immersion?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I don’t know. I think with my most memorable gaming experiences, that would not be true. Through high school, the game I played most was a puzzle game called <i>Bust-A-Move 2 </i>for the PlayStation. My favorite thing to do would be to come home from school, fire up the PlayStation and <i>Bust-A-Move</i>, and put on my favorite music CD at the time. I guess it was immersion in that I got to let everything else go away, and I wouldn’t have to think of anything but that activity. I would of course do that thing that you do when playing any game &#8212; be it jump rope, hopscotch, or shooting basketballs &#8212; I would think, if I don’t get the high score on this level then I’m going to hell.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Then the floor is lava.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11172" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/10/the-sport-of-youth-and-fashion-of-the-age/pic2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg" data-orig-size="640,392" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pic2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=392" alt="This floor is lava" width="640" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11172" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Then the floor is lava. Or you imagine that you’re competing for a gold medal in the Olympic event that is <i>Bust-A-Move 2</i>. So I think that maybe that’s me trying to insert myself into the game. But in <i>FIFA</i> you’re able to…</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> And <i>FIFA</i> is currently your game of choice, right?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yeah, <i>FIFA</i> is my game of choice. I play the online pro portion of the game where you take a player from a very amateur skill level and compete online with other real-life players, or with your team with other real-life players, in order to improve your guy. As he scores goals, completes passes, runs a certain distance, he becomes a better player.</p>
<p>You can mold this player to physically look the way you want. His height, his weight, his face, his hair, and a lot guys try to make theirs look really cool like <i>World of Warcraft</i> style. But I always try to make my guy look exactly like me so when I’m playing I can imagine it’s me up there.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So then <i>FIFA</i> is totally about immersing yourself in the game you love.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Totally.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So you play online with real people. Tell me a little bit about your. . . club?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yes, it’s “club.” Right now there are about fifteen players on the team, and of those fifteen probably five would be considered inactive because they never play with us. Of the remaining ten people it’s a constant rotation of four or five that are online at any given time. We usually only play together as a club if we have at least three people online. You play with less than three, and you’re putting yourselves at a disadvantage.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Because AI populates the rest of your team?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Exactly. You have much less control.</p>
<p>So our club, Half Baked FC, called such because the creators of the club are really big into the movie <i>Half Baked</i> starring Dave Chappelle and Jim Breuer, we play in a stadium that is called Mile High Stadium. When I first started playing, our team “kit,” or uniform, was the LA Galaxy uniform because their sponsor is Herbalife. Now I don’t think this is particularly interesting, but if you’re an online gamer you run into a lot of stoners.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Hm. I see.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Most of the guys on my team are stoners. They’ll have to take thirty second breaks to “roll a doobie.” Their words, not mine.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> You seem as though you are, perhaps, not a stoner?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I am not, and I’ll have interesting conversations with the guys on the team where they say, “so uh, you don’t smoke weed, do you?”</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Wow, they can tell just from your voice?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> (laughs) Well no, they ask directly. But their follow up question is always, “so, what DO you do?” Look, I’m the oldest person on this club, so far as I know.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11174" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/10/the-sport-of-youth-and-fashion-of-the-age/pic3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,392" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1353584578&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pic3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=392" alt="GOOOOOOAAAL!!!" width="640" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11174" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Do you have any long-standing rivals? Every team needs a long-standing rival.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> That’s true, but there are just too many teams. There are teams that we come up against frequently, but you know this from playing online, most rivalries stem from various racial epithets being thrown around the headset.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Or in my case, some classic sexual harassment.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Right, and I don’t condone any of it at all! Though I’m not above trash talking.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> There’s a difference between trash talking and harassment, though. What would be a choice trash talk from Brandon Kelley?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I like a good “yeah, bitch.” (laughs) It depends on the situation. If I’m trash talking in the instance where I got the better of the other team, then I’ll deploy the “yeah, bitch.” If I have to get involved in trash talking when I have been on the losing end, I’ll only do it if they did, in fact, best me. There will be situations where the other team won either through computer error, or they just got lucky. Then I will have to tell them.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> (laughs) You will have to inform them of this.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> “I’m sorry, but there was a CPU error. The artificial intelligence really needs to be improved in this aspect of the game, since it was the only reason why you were able to score a goal.”</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> And you do it in this calm, reasonable manner, I’m assuming. That’s really helpful of you.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> My actual favorite trash talk right now is when I do something that’s really great, I’ll do the McDonald’s theme song: (sings) “Boo do boo boo boo, I’m lovin’ it!” I especially like that one because my Polish teammate is also really into it, so he’ll do it too. Then of course there’s the old standby: “You mad?” The one I’ve been trying to work in that I don’t think is going to work is, “Google me.”</p>
<p>What’s interesting about my team, is that we have been playing together for about two years, but I don’t know anybody’s real name. So, Hairy_Bud: everyone calls him “Hairy.” Maybe his real name is Harold, I don’t know. There’s a Marine, and his PlayStation screen name is USMC and then some four-digit number that has some significance to him. So we call him “US.” I think his name is Ryan? They call me Kelley, because I chose my screen name without fully understanding the world I was getting into and used my gmail address. (Sara laughs) Yeah, I’m pretty close to just having my social security number be my handle. But then somebody calls me “NYC” because they know I live in New York City.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like being in the military, where everyone goes by a nickname like “Tex.” And I absolutely feel camaraderie with these guys. Particularly when new people come into the team. They are expected to defer to the founding members of the club and to those who have been around for longer. It’s very comfortable when I log on with these guys. There’s no awkward interaction. There’s a rapport that’s already been established.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So it’s like playing on a real-life sports team.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yeah. These are guys who you would be comfortable enough around to say, “Man, I had a shitty day.” And you can sort of let off some of that tension.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> That’s awesome. So what was the last non-sports game you played that you really enjoyed? Just to prove you have breadth in your experience.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I really enjoyed <i>Journey</i>.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Perfect game. I hesitate to call any game perfect, but perfect game. That and <i>Portal</i>.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I definitely wouldn’t dispute that.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Thanks for chatting with me. Maybe sports games don’t actually “suck hard” as twelve-year-old me would say while suffering through <i>Madden</i>. Any parting words?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Google me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/21/of-twitter-and-tifosi/">McLaren</a> follow-up piece languishes, almost-but-not-quite there. In the meantime, I was asked by friends to provide some sort of column describing what to pack for the quickly approaching United States Grand Prix (USGP). I’ve been to three grand prix weekends (2005, 2006, and 2007) and I have a planning streak a mile wide. While not intended as a comprehensive list, this should give you a good idea of what to expect and how best to enjoy a Formula 1 weekend.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This is a story about a cooler.</p>
<p>A well-prepared journey can be better than its end. As someone who cannot be without music, my iPhone is jacked into the cigarette lighter to keep charged, the radio transmitter on standby for those barren wastelands of endless old country stations, talk radio, and Jesus. When we cross into Texas, we’ll stop to pick up a map from the state tourism bureau. There’s something cool about being able to study a map and plan a route, exploring different ways to get from Point A to Point B. I also slightly mistrust Apple Maps, honestly.</p>
<p>For us the drive is over twice as long as the Indianapolis adventure. For a trip like this we’ll stash a cooler with ice and drinks in the back seat. This cooler is an important part of the adventure &#8212; unassuming, nondescript, yet essential to overall road trip success. I’ll also make sure we’re stocked with snacks &#8212; salty, delicious pioneer food. The emergency battery charger/starter goes in the trunk, next to the toolkit and suitcases. Oil’s changed; tires look excellent. . . well, good enough to get through 1,200 miles.</p>
<p>Ensuring access to power for your various electronic devices is essential. Earlier this year, when Chris and I crashed Indianapolis 500 Pole Day, I destroyed my iPhone’s battery in four hours. Until tracks and sponsors figure out how to incorporate charging stations into their displays (captive audiences, HELLO) you will need to prepare. Armed with a battery extender and a small portable charger, the phone should be able to make it through massive amounts of on-track tweets and pictures.</p>
<p>Four hours, for the record, is not even a half-day on track. . . and you need to plan on being on-track all day. Every day.</p>
<p>I recognize many choose to attend on race day only, or cannot get away from work or obligations to attend a full three-day race weekend. With that said, I strongly encourage everyone to try to attend a full race weekend at least once in their life. (Yes, everyone &#8212; even non-Formula 1 fans.) There’s something magical about being on track, something I’ve not witnessed at other events.</p>
<p>I have several logical reasons for asking you to drag your tired bones out of bed at ohgodthirty to open the gates. The most obvious reason concerns crowds. There are generally fewer people on the Friday and Saturday of a race weekend. This is often the best time to get pictures, particularly of the cars in the pits.</p>
<p>At least, this used to be the case: I am not sure if fans will be able to move around to different seats during Friday and Saturday sessions in Austin. At the Indianapolis track, you purchased a general admission ticket for Friday and Saturday &#8212; seats were only assigned for Sunday, and only if you didn’t purchase general admission. You could also move to other seats once the race started, provided you weren’t displacing others. I am not sure if this will hold true in Texas.</p>
<p>Traffic will also be an issue at this race. This is not Indianapolis; the road system around the Austin track is not prepared for an onslaught of vehicles. It’s going to be an unholy mess. Accept this and prepare accordingly. Leave early. Anticipate delays. Remember that <strong>cooler</strong>, in this column about a cooler? It gets filled with beer and water and left in the car. After a long day on track, spend a little time rehydrating in the parking lot (responsibly, of course) and chatting with fellow race fans. It’s much more pleasant than fuming in a gridlocked vehicle.</p>
<p>If you think your phone camera will suffice, I have bad news for you. It won’t. I hope you can get your hands on <strong>a cheap SLR</strong>, unless you’re in an area of the track where the cars will be particularly slow. You’ll get a lot of beautiful pictures of the tarmac, and maybe a blurred rear wing. Bring the point-and-shoot &#8212; and extra memory cards, just in case &#8212; but don’t rely on it as your primary camera if you’re looking to get good shots of the car on track.</p>
<p>Another option? Forget about taking pictures. Scrape the Internet after the event and see what others post instead. Laugh at those of us with a heavy camera around our neck, too busy hunting for the next shot to appreciate the enormity of the event. Either way, you’re guaranteed to have a good time.</p>
<p>Bring <strong>sunscreen</strong>. I don’t care if the race is in June or November. You. Will. Need. It. Spending all day on track will mean your face is exposed, continuously, to the unforgiving Texan sun. Unless you are ensconced in one of the luxurious private boxes or, even better, in the Paddock Club, you’re not going to find overhead protection from the sun. Formula 1 is cool, but it’s not worth skin cancer and scars.</p>
<p>Grab <strong>a lanyard for your tickets</strong> as soon as you can. I’ve always used this as an excuse to purchase a track lanyard; sometimes sponsors hand out free lanyards at the gate.</p>
<p>Another track essential is <strong>cold, hard cash</strong>. While the circuit promises ATMs, fees and lines could make that a miserable experience. Chris and I keep a change bag from year to year, cashing out the change immediately before heading to the race. This is our track money &#8212; the cash we spend on food and drinks, or on souvenirs. Cash is king on track. Generally, I don’t bring anything on track other than my driver’s license and cash &#8212; no credit cards or ATM cards if I can help it. I’m hauling enough as it is; the more I leave behind the better.</p>
<p>More essentials to litter your bag: <strong>earplugs</strong>.  Spring for the ones that have the plastic cord between them &#8212; you can knot them to a hat or your ticket lanyard (or loop them around your neck), instead of coating them with a thin film of pocket lint. You’ll also want to bring a cheap, disposable <strong>rain poncho</strong>. Unless you’re slogging through a rainy session at Spa, chances are the flimsy clear plastic ponchos you can pick up for a dollar or two at your local mega-market will more than meet your wet-weather needs.  Throw <strong>a pack of gum</strong> in your bag, <strong>a Sharpie</strong>, too: you never know if you’ll meet someone noteworthy on track or on the way to the paddock in the morning. Make sure there’s at least one bottle of <strong>water</strong>. Keep hydrated; alcoholic beverages don’t count. Wear the most comfortable pair of shoes you own. This is not the time to break in your new cowboy boots (though I am sure they are very cute, best save them for the F1Blog party). You will walk for miles over the course of a race weekend. I’m not exaggerating.</p>
<p>If you’re really into the spirit of things, you might want to bring a <strong>flagpole and/or flag</strong> to the event. Just remember to be kind &#8212; don’t obstruct views; if someone tells you to lower your flag, listen. If you do carry a flag or wear team gear, prepare yourself for a lot of interactions with other fans &#8212; the opportunity for Formula 1 fans throughout the US to come together and celebrate a race on home soil creates an indescribable atmosphere.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>airhorns</strong> are also (for some, at least, including me) a vital part of on-track action. How else can you provide encouragement to the stragglers during the support races, or the lone car on track during the early stages of Free Practice One? (Fingers crossed they won’t be confiscated by track workers.)</p>
<p>This article really isn’t about a cooler at all. It’s about the community built by and for Formula 1 fans, gathered around a small blue cooler, reliving the day’s adventures with like-minded souls with a beer and a salty snack. Be prepared to experience the unexpected, the sublime and the insane. This is a race weekend. Soak it up. Listen to the engines, to the cacophony of the fans. Feel the sun on your face. Smell the gas and oil and chemicals and beer and sausage and who knows what else as you amble around trackside. Know that, no matter what else happens in your lifetime, that you can say you were part of the 2012 United States Grand Prix.</p>
<p>See you in Turn 12. Find me. I’ll be the one with the blonde hair, purple glasses, black knapsack, large white-and-blue Finnish flag and even larger grin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The worst part of being an addict is the lack of a fix.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an NHL addict. I read NHL blogs, listen to NHL podcasts, follow NHL writers and players on Twitter, and even had a brief writing gig for a hockey blog (a weekly column about fantasy hockey). Heck, I even had a weekly talk show about the NHL during my tenure as a college radio host. Hockey has been a subject of <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/06/11/being-an-nhl-fan-in-lansing/" target="_blank">a few</a> of my comic strips on <a title="comics and such" href="http://clattertron.com" target="_blank">Clattertron</a>, and will be featured in more to come.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10595" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/26/here-we-go-again-another-nhl-lockout/igeekhockey/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,464" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Igeekhockey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=194" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10595" title="Igeekhockey" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=640" alt="I geek hockey" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=97 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=194 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"   /> To further beat a dead horse, when I was asked to be a part of the Capital Area District Libraries&#8217; Geek the Library campaign, my fliers and such proudly proclaimed, “I Geek Hockey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suffice to say, the current NHL Lockout, the third of Commissioner Gary Bettman&#8217;s career, is a blockade around my supply. I&#8217;m an addict without a fix.</p>
<p>And I hate every second. Hate is a strong word, and I try not to over use it, but it applies here. I hate the lockout.</p>
<p>I am still bitter about the loss of the 2004-2005 season due to the previous lockout. Several players I grew up watching missed a chance for one more season. It also meant a year without my favorite few months &#8212; The Stanley Cup Playoffs. No battles against rivals, no stories about a team chasing a cup, no chance of a team finally winning its first Cup or ending a decades long drought. For the first time since 1919, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004–05_NHL_lockout" target="_blank">no Stanley Cup was awarded</a>.</p>
<p>But, like an old girlfriend I can&#8217;t walk away from, I took the NHL back with open arms when it returned. I&#8217;m an addict after all. What was I going to do, start following football?</p>
<p>Not likely. I can&#8217;t stand football, basketball, or baseball. Anything with the &#8220;ball&#8221; suffix is right out &#8212; with the exception of Whirlyball.</p>
<p>First things first: <strong>this is not a strike</strong>. This is a <strong>lockout</strong>.</p>
<p>A strike is when the players refuse to play. That is not the case here. The players were locked out (not able to legally play) by the owners because their collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired, and a new CBA has not been agreed upon.</p>
<p>The previous CBA gave the NHL the salary cap, for better or worse (which is worthy of its own article). And with the salary cap came the insane cap circumventing contracts with a length of ten years or more (the final years of these long contracts have players earning about a million a year, with some contracts lasting until a player was 40 or older &#8212; this brings the yearly cap hit down). Most players are lucky to make it to 40, let alone 42 or 43 when a few notable contracts expire). The New Jersey Devils were penalized when the league deemed their 17-year, $102 million(!) contract with Ilya Kovalchuk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Kovalchuk#New_Jersey_Devils" target="_blank">circumvented the salary cap</a>. He was eventually signed for 15-years and $100 million.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the many, many issues behind this lockout. I recommend checking out the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/marek-vs.-wyshynski/id480511229" target="_blank">Marek versus Wyshynski podcast</a>, because they explain the issues better than I ever could. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/september-17th-edition-marek/id480511229?i=120813352" target="_blank">A recent episode</a> had an interview with NHLPA member (and retired player) Mathieu Schneider.</p>
<p>What this lockout will bring, I cannot say. When it will end is anyone&#8217;s guess. If, IF, this season is saved, I have heard the magic date of late November. This would mean the NHL&#8217;s biggest cash cow, the Winter Classic, would still happen.</p>
<p>As much as I want to see, or attend, an outdoor game featuring the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs (at the University of Michigan&#8217;s Big House no less), I am not optimistic it will happen.</p>
<p>Both sides seem far apart in this lockout, and I have read anecdotal comments from players expecting this lockout to, once again, last all season. NHL players have been heading off to play in Europe this week (most notably, Russia&#8217;s KHL), which hints this lockout could last a while.</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Those really hurt by this lockout are the support staff &#8212; the folks who work at the arena. There have been a slew of layoffs around the NHL already, and there are likely more to come.</p>
<p>Please, don&#8217;t let there be another lost season. One game missed it too many. I need my fix. And I don&#8217;t want to resort to fantasy baseball again, like I did last time (I had no idea what I was doing, which the same scenario when I attend a baseball game in person &#8212; I&#8217;m lost, except for the drinking beer outside part. I have that covered).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rivalries &#8212; particularly between organizations &#8212; intrigue me. The rivalry between Ferrari and McLaren is particularly interesting, especially considering the relatively small world of Formula 1. I’ve touched on this before &#8212; twelve teams make up the current Formula 1 ranks. While each team employs hundreds to staff their Formula 1 operations, the actual number of people directly affiliated with on-track operations is relatively small.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time on Twitter. A LOT. For Formula 1 fans in the United States, it’s another way to band together around our shared love of the sport, 140 characters at a time. I wanted to see how others would respond to a fundamental question in Formula 1. This question defines one in the eyes of others within the realm of Formula 1 &#8212; are you the sexy, finely tuned distillation of pure power and raw adrenaline, or are you the sleek embodiment of technical purity?</p>
<p>These questions haunt the minds of Formula 1 fans, and I needed a response to put my mind at ease. To Twitter!</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10576" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/21/of-twitter-and-tifosi/tweet1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png" data-orig-size="530,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="tweet1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png?w=530" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10576" title="tweet1" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png?w=640" alt="tweet1" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png 530w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tweet1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px"   /></p>
<p>McLaren vs. Ferrari isn’t the only battle on pit lane; however, their rivalry is both longstanding and scandalous. In 2007, McLaren managed to set the dubious record of Highest Fine Ever Levied in the History of Everything &#8212; $100,000,000 &#8212; when the team was found guilty of breaching Article 151(c) of the International Sporting Code by possessing confidential information concerning systems on another team’s car.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly. One. Hundred. Million. Dollars.</p>
<p>The events of 2007 &#8212; colloquially known as Spygate or Stepneygate &#8212; are comprehensively <a href="http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/17844641__WMSC_Decision_130907.pdf" target="_blank">documented</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Formula_One_espionage_controversy" target="_blank">online</a> and not the primary focus of this article. The short version: Nigel Stepney, ostensibly angry over Ross Brawn’s departure, lashed out against Ferrari by providing engineers from other teams with confidential technical data on various systems used by the Ferrari team on their cars. After a series of investigations, extraordinary meetings (yes, that’s what they are called), testimony from McLaren drivers and team personnel, motions, and other various and sundry gatherings, McLaren (among other teams) was found guilty of “any fraudulent conduct or any act prejudicial to the interests of any competition or to the interests of motor sport generally” (FIA International Sporting Code, p. 58).</p>
<p>Regardless of the other questions raised as part of this entire fiasco, one question begs answering: why would McLaren, a venerable name in its own right, obtain confidential information on another team’s car?</p>
<p>This is Scuderia Ferrari’s F2007, winding through the turns at the 2007 United States Grand Prix. Imagine this beast screaming past you at over 185 miles per hour.</p>

<p>Stare at that picture for a minute, please. Let your eye trace the curve of the nose into the cockpit, winnowing around the engine and skimming over the low rear wing. Can you blame McLaren (or <em>any</em> team) from wanting to know how that machine worked? Sensuous curves of carbon fiber composites wrapped tightly around a core of pure power: a championship-winning combination that dominated the sport for several years.</p>
<p>Ferrari spends a lot of money &#8212; we’re talking “you could run a small country on that kind of budget” money &#8212; in making their cars perform without sacrificing aesthetics. I’ve never really counted myself among the ranks of Ferrari fans &#8212; not even when Raikkonen drove for Ferrari &#8212; but even I have to admit the F2007 was a beautiful car.</p>
<p>We’ve all identified a dream company that, if they called tomorrow, we’d leap. The same can be said for Formula 1 employees, and the company in this context is almost always Ferrari. As the oldest team on the modern Formula 1 grid, Scuderia Ferrari represents tenacity, technical brilliance, and an unflagging work ethic. To work for Ferrari is to continue a tradition of greatness. To work for Ferrari is to work for what Enzo Ferrari built, many years ago. To bring victory to Maranello elevates a driver to the highest levels of adoration.</p>
<p>When Chris (my husband) started watching Formula 1, he decided to primarily cheer for Michael Schumacher. Schumacher and Ferrari have always worked incredibly well together. I’m not sure what pacts were made or magic was cast when Ross Brawn, Nigel Stepney, Michael Schumacher, and Jean Todt joined forces at Ferrari, but the results were nothing short of astonishing. Relentlessly pursuing technical perfection, Ferrari dominated the sport for several years and (directly or indirectly) brought about several changes in the regulations. While Schumacher’s last season was not his best, Ferrari still held a dominant position at the front of the field.</p>

<p>Schumacher understood his role within the team &#8212; he was there to win each race, to continue the traditions ensconced by Enzo Ferrari several years prior. He developed a strong bond with the team &#8212; fans could sense the genuine affection between Schumacher and his engineers. The tifosi adored Schumacher, he gave them what they craved: victory on Sunday afternoon. Schumacher returned the sparkle to Ferrari’s name; he made Ferrari the place where drivers wanted to end their careers, world championship title in hand. In response, Ferrari provided Schumacher with a car that represented art in vehicular form.</p>
<p>I keep mentioning the tifosi, loosely defined as enthusiastic Ferrari fans. This definition is a bit misleading. Substitute “balls-out crazy” for enthusiastic and you may be getting slightly closer to the true definition of the term. Tifosi are the northern lights of Formula 1 racing: impossible to explain; breathtaking in their splendor.</p>
<p>Imagine sitting trackside with thousands of other fans; most wearing at least one piece of team-branded attire. Some fans spend extraordinary wads of cash on team-approved kit: others spend hours designing and applying handcrafted logos to t-shirts. There’s a lot of red. Red tends to dominate the color palette of any given race weekend. Races in the United States are no exception.</p>
<p>It’s roughly six hundred degrees outside. You’ve found a sliver of shade, tucked in under the skyboxes in the main grandstand. You’ve got a good view of the pit lane, and you’ve managed to find yourself situated almost directly across from the Ferrari pits.</p>
<p><em>Thump. Thump. Thump. THUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPTHUMP. Thump. Thump. Thump.</em></p>
<p>Are those. . . drums?</p>
<p>Welcome to the wonder and whimsy known as the tifosi. Suddenly, your hand-transferred logo looks shoddy; your team colors pale in comparison to the gloriousness that is the tifosi in their full, slightly inebriated glory.</p>

<p>Drums. Whistles. Singing. Joy.</p>
<p>I snapped this picture on Saturday qualifying during the 2007 United States Grand Prix. Massa’s pit was almost directly across where we were sitting, and this small group of Brazilian tifosi (who technically represent their own subset of tifosi; don’t make me break out the Venn diagram for this one) made sure everyone in the stands knew they were there for Ferrari and Massa. This group sang, banged on a drum, chanted, and cheered. Massa came out of his garage to wave. He had to.</p>
<p>How can you deny the tifosi?</p>

<p>Imagine standing on that elevated platform in the upper half of the image, wearing Ferrari red. The familiar strains of Italy’s national anthem blare from enormous speakers. Look at those people wearing red. They are all singing along, singing to you, singing because of you. The track becomes the sanctuary; the anthem the tifosi’s hymn. You are the physical embodiment of a nation’s pride.</p>
<p>Call it a religion. Call it a cult. Not everyone’s a member, that’s certain.</p>

<p>This was my first response, and I understand this sentiment completely. I was raised with a bias against Ferrari and a strong love for teams like McLaren and Williams. It’s kind of like raising your kid to like the Cubs or the White Sox. You can’t cheer for both teams, and your choice will shape your destiny for generations. Some families raise their kids to cheer for Ferrari; Dad raised me to cheer for McLaren. When Raikkonen went to Ferrari, I felt betrayed, for I’d have to cheer Ferrari on.</p>
<p>It’s what you do.</p>
<p>I cut my racing teeth following drivers like Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard, then Raikkonen and Juan Pablo Montoya. I still believe the MP4-20 is one of the most beautiful cars to grace a starting grid. Watching Jenson Button put the MP4-27 through its paces this year makes me wish for a Raikkonen-Button McLaren future pairing.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest: I don’t understand the love for Ferrari, but I accept it. To love Formula 1 is to accept the role of tradition and history in the sport. Ferrari has earned a certain level of respect by virtue of their tenure and role in the sport. McLaren’s sleek, calculating, refined image balances Ferrari’s tempestuous, bold, lavish countenance. Each highlights the strengths and weaknesses of one another; demonstrates the allure and mystery of Formula 1.</p>
<p>NOTE: Lest you think McLaren’s been ignored, I beseech you to wait two weeks before making that determination. I need a Part Two for this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few short months ago, rumors began circulating that the Saints were being investigated for what many would consider to be foul play. After a period of speculation and anticipation, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, the Templar of Player Safety, dropped the hammer. Head Coach Sean Payton was suspended for a year, the Saints organization was fined the league-maximum $500,000, and the Saints forfeited their second round draft picks for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. Additionally, GM Mickey Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the season and assistant coach Joe Vitt  was suspended for six games. </p>
<p>GODdell saved his BFG2000 for ex-Saints and &#8220;current&#8221; Rams defensive coordinator  Gregg Williams: <em>suspended indefinitely</em>. That&#8217;s business-speak for excommunication. Banned. GTFO. </p>
<p>There are other details and fancy language, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7718136/sean-payton-new-orleans-saints-banned-one-year-bounties" target="_blank">which you can read here</a>.</p>
<p>As far as whether these punishments are necessary and whatnot, well, GODdell made inquiries on this very topic within the Saints organization after the <strong>2009 NFC Championship game</strong>, many moons ago, and continued to do so <em>for years</em>. Some have declared &#8220;player&#8217;s code&#8221; against snitches, but when you stand in solidarity on the boat when the iceberg is coming, well, we know what happened to the Titanic.</p>
<p>The following are excerpts from ESPN&#8217;s coverage (linked above). </p>
<blockquote><p>We are all accountable and responsible for player health and safety and the integrity of the game. We will not tolerate conduct or a culture that undermines those priorities,&#8221; said Goodell, whose league faces more than 20 concussion-related lawsuits brought by hundreds of former players. &#8220;No one is above the game or the rules that govern it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize our fans&#8217; concerns and we regret the uncertainty this episode has created for them. We are humbled by the support our organization has received from our fans today in the wake of this announcement, and we ask them to continue to stand with us, as they have done in the past, when both our team and our city have overcome greater adversities,&#8221; the Saints said in a statement responding to the penalties.</p>
<p>&#8220;To our fans, the NFL and the rest of our league, we offer our sincere apology and take full responsibility for these serious violations. It has always been the goal of the New Orleans Saints to create a model franchise and to impact our league in a positive manner. There is no place for bounties in our league and we reiterate our pledge that this will never happen again.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I recognize that there is a conflict of interest for a player or coach to not wish injury upon another player. After all, the same could happen to them. But that is superstition. There is no correlation between a player injuring another either consciously or inadvertently and that same player&#8217;s own bodily integrity. I am immediately dismissive of &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t want that to happen to anyone because it could happen to us.&#8221; That is much too politically-correct for my tastes. </p>
<p>What I question is the perception of bounties as problematic, especially in the context of a violent sport with strong ties to Vegas. Is an intentional attempt to injure another player simply unsportsmanlike, as Goodell suggests in his &#8220;integrity of the game&#8221; statement? Is it something we would not expect of model citizens? &#8220;Do unto others as you would have done unto you&#8221;?  </p>
<p>If so, that is quite a saintly perspective among bandits, and one would have to honestly say to themselves that winning is, in actuality, <em>not</em> the supreme goal of a professional sport. </p>
<p>I would like to address a counter-point from a colleague:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trying to knock guys on their ass is part of the game, and there&#8217;s no question here. But when you have guys being rewarded by their coaches and other veteran players to intentionally injure opposing players, putting their careers and potentially their lives at risk (especially with this newfound emphasis on preventing concussions) for cash is just despicable. I understand that it&#8217;s just a game, but in the real world, if someone handed you 10 grand to break some guy&#8217;s ankles in the parking lot, that is a crime.</p>
<p>Compounded with the 09 NFCCG when the Saints were prattling on and on about giving Favre &#8220;remember me shots&#8221; and constantly hitting him late after plays (which is what initially spurred the investigation), they really signed their own death warrant in this situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t really buy the &#8220;potential for life threatening injury&#8221; argument because NFL players have undergone physicals and signed waivers stating &#8220;YOU MAY SUSTAIN INJURY PLAYING THIS SPORT&#8221; since Pop Warner level. A player who is concerned with quality of life should not be in the NFL, and probably not play football at all. </p>
<p>I would buy the &#8220;if this were on the street it would be a crime&#8221; approach, except that football players aren&#8217;t on the street. (Never mind, say, hitting someone in the face outside of the octagon.) We could think of all sorts of hypotheticals, but the fact remains that linebackers are paid millions to bring the pain. Example:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYltxqyJC0A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Translation: &#8220;This is all we need! We gonna keep hittin&#8217; them! We gonna keep hittin&#8217; them! They might get back up&#8230; We&#8217;re gon&#8217; hit &#8217;em again! And when they&#8217;re barely hanging on, when they&#8217;re about to go home to momma, we&#8217;re gonna hit &#8217;em in the mouth! We gonna &#8220;bloody&#8221; they nose, we&#8217;re gonna run em to the ground!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like the language of an assault to me. Except it isn&#8217;t either unusual or illegal. </p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to figure out, again, is why any of this should be considered despicable, especially if the action takes place on the football field, with legal hits. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I wrote the above several months ago when my editor asked me for a response to Bounty-Gate. Not too much has changed since then in terms of the scandal itself. An appeal here, an appeal there. What HAS changed are the studies discussing the affects of concussions on players and questions raised concerning football&#8217;s permanence as a viable sport. I&#8217;ll get to that some other time, but I want to say that my failure to complete this piece was a result of not knowing how to proceed beyond where I was without sounding like a stereotypical jock. I was conflicted. Now that football season is upon us, I have had time to think further about why this is really a non-issue. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>People want to see players get smashed</strong></li>
<p>As I mentioned above, the players want to smash and the people want to see it. Google &#8220;Joe Theisman&#8221; for the YouTube video of his injury via Lawrence Taylor and see why his name is practically a euphemism. Hard hits make the SportsCenter top 10 highlight videos. People don&#8217;t watch boxing anymore, not because it&#8217;s corrupt, but because the best fighters today are in the smaller weight classes and they don&#8217;t have the power to knock people out.</p>
<p>I personally am a fan of old-school smash-mouth style football, contrary to the direction football is going with the air-out game. Three yards and a cloud of dust.</p>
<li><strong>The rules revolving around &#8220;player safety&#8221; are heavily focused on facilitating an offensive game.</strong></li>
<p>Chris Canty said that <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-08-14/news/33204036_1_chris-canty-line-depth-markus-kuhn" target="_blank">there is a 100% injury rate in football</a>, so the idea of focusing on &#8220;player safety&#8221; is a bit of a paradox. Individuals such as Junior Seau and what he did to himself are the exception, not the rule. Some injuries are worse than others but everyone plays hurt. In fact, Goodell wants to expand the season, which is RIDICULOUS AND HYPOCRITICAL if he is, in fact, concerned about player health.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have new rules, such as this one from 2011: </p>
<blockquote><p>A receiver who has completed a catch is a “defenseless player” until he has had time to protect himself or has clearly become a runner. A receiver/runner is no longer defenseless if he is able to avoid or ward off the impending contact of an opponent.  Previously, the receiver who had completed a catch was protected against an opponent who launched and delivered a blow to the receiver’s head </p></blockquote>
<p>To a fan of the defensive game, this is infuriating. Before this rule change, defensive players intentionally hit receivers violently to jar the ball from the after a catch to force an incomplete pass. Now, the most one can hope for is a fumble, but even that is unlikely because the receiver would have had time to solidify possession of the ball and prepare for the incoming assaults. Wide receivers like Calvin Johnson and Larry Fitzgerald are bigger, faster, stronger now, so who was the focus when this rule change came about? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhET1IC0gMo" target="_blank">DeSean Jackson, who, contrary to all the fuss, was hit legally</a>. Robinson hit him in the shoulder, rather than the head. Jackson weighs 200 pounds soaking wet with a brick in his pocket, so of course he is going to get blown up going across the middle.</p>
<p>Combined with defensive holding penalties and pass interference rules, there is little defensive players can do but watch and try to react as receivers zip by them. Big hits with running backs against linebackers are rare, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iUUPNPPHg" target="_blank">but they do happen</a>. (The hit there is helmet to helmet, by the way.)</p>
<p>Speaking of helmet-to-helmet hits, the only positions where there is 100% contact on every play is lineman. Defensive and offensive. They&#8217;re basically sumo wrestlers for sixty minutes, head, spine, and hips. Where is the concern for these guys &#8212; the most likely to play concussed all game? We don&#8217;t take notice of them because the cameras are not following them, and it&#8217;s a cardinal sin, more at this position than any other, to complain about pain.</p>
<li><strong>Overprotective rules encourage Bounty Gate to exist.</strong></li>
<p>Imagine the NFL mades a special rule that if a player displayes symptoms of a concussion, then they cannot return to the game. Think about it: if the concussion rule requires players to sit out, defensive coordinators can sacrifice a knight/rook/bishop for a queen &#8212; Aaron Rogers for &#8220;insert player here&#8221; &#8212; because nobody on either side of the ball is as valuable. This used to be a running joke, trying to intentionally take someone out with a sacrifice player. That&#8217;s different from hitting a wide receiver &#8220;crossing the face of a linebacker&#8221; as we call it, to check a receiver from doing so in the future, or hitting him so hard that he will &#8220;remember&#8221; and have butterfingers next time.</p>
<p>Seriously, someone is going to have to explain why knocking the star quarterback out of the game is not a sound strategy in today&#8217;s pass-happy NFL. This is Sun Tzu stuff we&#8217;re talking here. If Michael Vick isn&#8217;t in the game, the defensive side of the same team has added pressure on them because they know the backup isn&#8217;t as good even if they say he is &#8212; if he were as good, he would be STARTING somewhere. </p>
<li><strong>Money isn&#8217;t an issue.</strong></li>
<p>Some have argued that cash prizes are suspect. We&#8217;re talking about people who make hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars here. (Why? See observation #1.) The bounties are chump change that only Uncle Sam would be concerned about.</ol>
<p>We as a culture say we don&#8217;t want to see players get hurt (because many of them are our sons after all), and we clap and cheer when a player can get off the field without a stretcher because it&#8217;s proper etiquette &#8212; etiquette in a gladiator sport. That sounds akin to practicing ethics during full-scale war. No, football is hell, where there are no Saints.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Pogue</strong> spends his time spoiling the fun by taking the joke too seriously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Photo Credit: <a title="nic_r photostream" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/somethingness/7416144040/in/photostream" target="_blank">nic_r</a> (licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike)</em></p>
<p><strong>November 11, 2011</strong></p>
<p>I’m sitting in a small barbecue restaurant over 800 miles from home, having a spirited conversation with a couple of friends about Kimi Raikkonen and his chances of coming back to Formula 1 for the 2012 season after his abrupt 2009 departure. Raikkonen’s been linked throughout the season to several teams, including a couple generally regarded as relative underdogs. One of these teams is Lotus Renault.</p>
<p>The Iceman, as he’s known in the paddock, earned his reputation as a man who cares solely about driving. Rumor has it he sleeps until right before he’s required to be on track for the drivers’ parade. He notoriously hates giving interviews before races. I always thought it was funny when Peter Windsor, former grid commentator for SPEED’s Formula 1 coverage, would never ask him questions before a race, instead proffering a heartfelt “good luck” before slipping away.</p>
<p>Racing reigns supreme for Raikkonen. Give him a car that won’t break, and he’ll do his best to finish first. It’s that simple. Driving (briefly) for Sauber in 2001 before Ron Dennis and McLaren snapped him up for 2002, Raikkonen then captured the seat vacated by seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher at the close of the 2006 season, spending three years in Ferrari’s employ.</p>
<p>Drivers dream of finishing their racing careers cloaked in that distinctive shade of scarlet, hearing the cheers of rabid Italian fans (commonly referred to as the <em>tifosi</em>) as they cross the finish line. I challenge you to find a driver on the current Formula 1 grid that would not want to hear the church bells ring in Maranello on Sunday afternoon, commemorating another Ferrari victory. Ferrari exemplifies the history and tradition of the sport. It’s just the way of things in Formula 1.</p>
<p>After his 2009 departure, speculation abounded on whether he’d ever return. Schumacher did it. Could Raikkonen? It appeared, based on various media reports, we’d soon see.</p>
<p>Frank, an incredibly astute and generally awesome guy who’s produced and followed Formula 1 for decades, started laughing at one point. “We came up with a solution for this a long time ago. Lock him in his motorhome before races; let him leave as soon as he’s done on track. Have the team pay the fines. No interviews, no sponsor meetings. Nothing. Kimi does best when he can just shut up and drive.”</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Recent coverage of Formula 1 echoes one basic sentiment: The teams receive funds directly proportionate to their finish in the constructors’ championship, not the individual results represented in drivers’ championship. There is no direct financial incentive for teams to focus on the results of the drivers’ championship. With that said, Formula 1 cars can&#8217;t drive themselves &#8212; the driver is the organic extension of the physical vehicle. Teams aggressively court drivers who show they’re able to block out the myriad distractions of the circus and focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t hurt if drivers bring sponsors to the team &#8212; while the monies won as part of the constructors’ championship are essential to continued team success, sponsors keep the bills paid. It’s fairly easy to see which teams struggle &#8212; cars without logos are cars without cash. It’s also easy to see why Frank’s solution simply would not work in a modern Formula 1 team: Sponsors expect drivers to attend various promotional events, smile, shake hands, and sign autographs for fans. In some cases, sponsors can influence driver choices for teams. It’s essential to know how to play the game if you want to do well in Formula 1, but charm doesn’t replace skill. It’s all about finding the right balance.</p>
<p>The month of August is a bit of a respite for teams and journalists covering Formula 1, as they are required to shut down operations for two consecutive weeks during the month of August. While somewhat frustrating for teams looking to continue developing their cars, the break provides teams the opportunity to relax and breathe, if only for a moment. Factory shutdowns mean little transpires during the summer holiday. Idle tracks do not translate into idle minds, however. In the absence of new information, speculation runs amok. In short, this is the start of the “silly season,” where drivers nearing the end of their contract engage in a delicate, intricate dance. Step on too many toes and you’ll find yourself standing next to the wall, watching the others sway and dip to the music while you yearn for what could have been.</p>
<p>The overall structure and insular nature of Formula 1 makes it difficult to break into the sport &#8212; but if you play by the rules and excel at your job, you’re in for the ride of your life. The question seems obvious: What are the rules?</p>
<p>While I’ve never managed to find an official list, the following three rules appear to reign supreme, particularly for drivers during the silly season:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t trash-talk your team, including your teammate. Ever.</strong></li>
<p>This first rule has been recently tested by some of the bigger drivers in the sport, particularly Lewis Hamilton. World Champion in 2008, Hamilton currently finds himself mired in contract negotiations with McLaren-Mercedes, the team he’s been linked to from the time he was a little boy. Signed at 13, Hamilton previously expressed his desire to spend his entire career there. Over the past year, however, he’s made comments insinuating this may no longer be the case. In fact, as I write this, Hamilton is currently mired in a bit of Twitter controversy over remarks he’s made about his place within the team. Teams work diligently to preserve a calm, unified front to the media; rogue comments by disgruntled drivers can destroy this work in seconds. Bruised egos, a tight championship, and rumor-mill machinations make these trying times for teams.</p>
<p>Raikkonen generally excels at following this rule. His responses to the press are legendary, and generally contain some variation of, “The car is good. I am happy with the car. For sure we have a good package and the team has been working very hard, but it is the same for everyone and we will just need to wait and see what happens during the race.”</p>
<p>True driver skill does not exist solely on track. In Formula 1, as in countless other organizations, knowing your message as well as your audience is essential for continued success.</p>
<li><strong>There’s a difference between on-track competition and off-track rivalry. Burn too many bridges in Formula 1 and you may find yourself on the outside looking in.</strong></li>
<p>If you’ve followed the sport for a while, you’re acutely aware of this second rule. The longer you’re in the sport, the more likely you are to jump between teams. This applies to all team personnel &#8212; drivers, engineers, mechanics, everyone. If you watch the teams talk about one another, you’ll quickly notice they rarely directly slam their competitors. While drivers and team personnel may discuss their team’s improvements, and how they have worked on their package over the season, there’s a definite lack of malice between teams.</p>
<p>Personally and professionally, this makes for a more harmonious paddock. It also provides the teams with the ability to band together when necessary to push for more driver/team representation in the sport. It’s also hard to be mean to those you’re surrounded by daily, and even harder to denigrate those who may be working with you next year.</p>
<li><strong>Dog brain reigns supreme. You’re only as good as your last race. Keep consistently performing (preferably at the front of the grid) and you’re set.</strong></li>
<p>“Dog brain” was a phrase coined by my husband to explain the behavior of non-playable characters (NPCs) in games like Oblivion and Skyrim. Dog brain, as defined by Chris, is when your character receives a new quest or challenge from the NPC as part of the ongoing game. Upon exiting the menu and leaving the interaction, the NPC asks if you’ve completed that task yet: dog brain. This can be applied, to a certain extent, in Formula 1.</p>
<p>Recent history is much more important than what happened in the past. Successful teams continuously improve. The past provides a reference plane; it does not dictate the future. Perform your best, every race.</ul>
<p>Learn these rules, or leave the sport. Shut up and drive.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<p><strong>February 1, 2012</strong></p>
<p>I’m in my office, reading through various tweets and articles. Formula 1 season is over a month away, and news revolves around car launches and testing dates.</p>
<p>Luke spies a flash of silver and peers over my shoulder.</p>
<p>“That car looks like sex on wheels.”</p>
<p>&#8220;That car&#8221; is the McLaren MP4-27. Shrouded in liquid silver, a slender nose melds seamlessly with the safety cell comprising the majority of the car, enveloping the driver in a protective cocoon of carbon fiber. Sleek sidepods channel air around the car, providing a cooling breeze for the 2.4L V8 Mercedes housed immediately behind the driver. The rear wing, jutting from the car’s rear, helps these incredibly lightweight cars stick to the track &#8212; and also provides sponsors a handy platform to tout their brand to millions of potential customers. When you’re talking about a car costing anywhere between $300-500 million to create, survival relies on sponsorship.</p>
<p>Sex on wheels is only part of the story.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Formula 1: Fast cars, laboriously preened and groomed by teams of talented engineers and mechanics into a pure distillation of performance. Twelve teams compete for the coveted constructors’ championship, prize money for the series goes to the winning team. Instead of one or two companies building chassis for the different teams, as you may see in NASCAR or IndyCar, each team is responsible for designing, manufacturing, testing, and developing their cars. Following a set of technical regulations created and issued by the <em>Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile</em> (FIA), each team spends countless hours testing and refining each component on the car to wring out every last drop of speed. Parts are continuously refined, tested, used; lather, rinse, repeat. Teams who stop developing their cars &#8212; either by choice or by circumstance &#8212; plummet through the ranks as rivals scramble to find that extra tenth in the corner. Why? That extra tenth can mean millions for a team.</p>
<p>These twenty-four cars house twenty-four drivers, culled from every racing series imaginable, campaigning not only for their constructors but also for the drivers’ championship. These drivers spend untold hours physically and mentally conditioning their bodies to become an extension of the car; one cannot exist without the other. They race for money, fame, and glory; they also race for the ability to carry the number one on the nose of their car the following year, forever afforded the title World Champion.</p>
<p>It’s a grueling schedule, honestly. In 2012, drivers and teams compete at twenty circuits scattered throughout the world. Historic tracks, like Monaco and Spa, mingle with purpose-built circuits, freshly paved and ready for the upcoming challenge. As the sport evolves, the tracks evolve as well. Newer tracks, like those in Shanghai and Dubai, often see top speeds of 190 mph, but top speed is but one aspect of the total package. Cars make anywhere between 14 and 25 turns on each track, with most tracks running clockwise. Some of these turns can be taken at high speed, but most are best navigated at around 45 mph. This rapid acceleration and deceleration, over and over for anywhere between 57 and 70 laps, takes its toll on man and machine. It’s a beautiful, graceful, exhausting dance.</p>
<p>Tracks pass a stringent series of checks before they can be approved for a race event, and the sport’s regulators emphasize safety. Modern tracks provide drivers with vast expanses of asphalt outside the official track limits (typically marked by brightly-painted curbs), so cars running off-track have room to safely rejoin. Older tracks use gravel instead of asphalt; historic tracks like Monaco rely on safety barriers and tire walls. Fleets of medical personnel hover around the track, ready to spring into action if needed. Armies of marshals and track personnel communicate to drivers throughout the course of the race, using a series of colored flags to designate different warnings or messages.</p>
<p>As fans, we cannot confuse safety with a lack of danger. This sport is dangerous. Drivers make their money pushing the limits of the car, every corner of every lap. Engineers and mechanics make their money ensuing the car is as light and aerodynamically efficient as possible, but continuous development coupled with a relative lack of on-track testing means no assurances of reliability. Drivers must be able to pressure one another without using their car as a wedge &#8212; to touch is to risk everything.</p>
<p>Every race weekend brings a mix of intrigue, talent, politics, wealth, technology, gossip, and speculation. As a student of organizational theory fascinated with figuring out how people work within organizations &#8212; and how organizations work within larger systems &#8212; it’s fascinating to watch interplay between teams. There’s something for everyone in Formula 1.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>June 17, 2005</strong></p>
<p>We’re standing on the infield at Turn 11, perched atop one of the grassy swells dotting the track’s edge. We left at 2:30 in the morning to ensure we’d be on track in time for the weekend’s first practice session. For my birthday, my mom and dad bought me a pair of tickets (and a coveted parking pass) to the USGP. It’s my first on-track experience; the smile on my face from sheer joy would shame the Cheshire cat.</p>
<p>I’m alternately waving and holding a large Finnish flag. My husband (new to Formula 1), stands next to me, clutching an air-horn and staring intently at the track. Our ears fill with the sound of V10s as the cars fire-up in the pits and find their way to the slick, clean track. Initial laps deposit fresh rubber on track, providing cars with increased grip as time ticks away. Tentative installation laps soon shift to full-fledged madness. Cars dash through the corner, dancing on the edge of breaking contact, but always managing to skitter through. I’m taking hundreds of pictures, trying to capture everything.</p>
<p>“Ah! I see we’ve found some fellow Raikkonen fans! Mind if we join you?”</p>
<p>I turn and see two friendly gentlemen, one with a shock of brilliantly white hair and a matching handlebar(!) moustache. His eyes smile at us. “I’m Scott. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>His friend grins and shakes hands. “I’m John.”</p>
<p>“I’m Erin. This is my husband, Chris. Nice to meet you, too.”</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Formula 1 fans in the United States &#8212; usually spotted roaming in packs at the wee hours of the morning on Twitter &#8212; face a maddening, uphill battle. NASCAR reigns supreme, particularly in the Midwest and South. If, like me, you live twenty-five miles from Carl Edwards’ hometown, you can’t escape. Co-workers stop me in the hallway to tell me they watched “some of that racing you like,” then proceed to describe Sunday’s IndyCar race. (I always mentally give bonus points if said race was held on an oval track.) I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve explained Danica Patrick’s non-role in Formula 1. There are worse things in life than having to explain this, I suppose.</p>
<p>I completely understand why people confuse IndyCar with Formula 1 in the United States. At first glance, both types of cars look similar: they are both open-wheeled cars with large front and rear wings. The driver sits in the center of the car; there’s an engine behind the driver. It doesn’t help that many of the names cross over between the two series, and have for several decades, including Villeneuve, Bourdais, Barrichello, and Montoya. The United States also has a less-than-stellar track record at keeping a Formula 1 race &#8212; it’s been five years since Formula 1 cars raced in the States. Race organizers must be willing to pony up large sums of cash for the honor of holding a Formula 1 race at their track; refuse to pay and Mr. Ecclestone will sell your slot to any number of other tracks openly salivating at the prospect of holding a race. The upcoming inaugural Austin race at the Circuit of the Americas holds great promise for the future of Formula 1 in the United States. I hope it works. This sport is awesome. I want others to share in its awesomeness.</p>
<p>My name is Erin Hansman. I’ve followed Formula 1 for a long time, but more closely since 2001. I live-tweet every session of every race, but I never spoil delayed broadcasts. I cheer unabashedly for Kimi Raikkonen. I’m an F1 geek, and an advocate for the fan. Join me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m writing this essay acknowledging how precarious it is to take what would appear to be a dissenting stance in the aftermath of what took place at Pennsylvania State University for only God knows how long. I would like to, if possible, sensibly evaluate the repercussions of  PSU&#8217;s behavior. I am aware of how I might be perceived in using quantifying language, but that is what we choose to do when we render judgment upon actions &#8212; or in this case, inactions &#8212; we deem intolerable. </p>
<p>Remember Southern Methodist University? Many did when wondering what should happen to PSU. SMU is practically a metaphor for the Death Penalty, which is termination of all football operations for one year. In fact, a story broke that <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8199905/penn-state-nittany-lions-rodney-erickson-said-school-faced-4-year-death-penalty" target="_blank">PSU could have faced a four-year Death Penalty</a>, suggesting that what the penalties the NCAA actually imposed were an Act of Mercy.</p>
<p>Negative. The NCAA&#8217;s suggestion of a 4-year death penalty is the equivalent of drawing a Royal Flush and raising the ante knowing your last opponent has to go all-in or fold lest they not have enough money to buy into the next hand. </p>
<p>I do not think that those hoping for the Death Penalty fully appreciate how the virtual termination of football would impact that community. We&#8217;re talking about economic quality-of-life here, not just football. I can remember when I was in college, and my roommate depended upon working security at Auburn University home games for gas money, and his 1988 Mitsubishi Gallant was almost always close to &#8220;E.&#8221; And that&#8217;s just a nominal, anecdotal example. Think about the hotels, restaurants, and apparel stores that would be affected by a complete football ban. The NCAA would not just be punishing PSU, but executing a college town. Scorched Earth economics for decisions made by administrators with whom most people in town may have never had contact. </p>
<p>These are among the reasons why I do not buy the &#8220;it&#8217;s just football&#8221; critique. Such approaches follow the path of making the political choice to not buy at a certain store because of its business practices, and that decision trickles down to the employee whose hours are reduced because of a lack of patronage (ironically, the cost differential between profit and hourly wages is called &#8220;labor&#8221;). And that is before considering how football, or sports in general, change lives. That grotesquely fat kid everyone made fun of is now, after a year of training, the most-sought offensive guard in the state, probably winning javelin competitions in the spring. The dude who never took school seriously is now a pseudo-scholar because he needs the grades for eligibility. To suggest that sports are superfluous luxuries&#8230;no, that only works at the professional level where players are unionized.</p>
<p>The SMU and the various universities that were recipients of the Death Penalty were justified in their plight for violations that had to do with <em>the competitive nature of the relevant sport</em>. We&#8217;re talking player and coaching recruiting violations, bribes, gambling, throwing games, manipulating scores, and professional players posing as college athletes. The closest PSU equivalent that I can come up with is that Jerry Sandusky&#8217;s persistent employment once the Athletic Director was notified of his behavior would be considered as PSU maintaining &#8220;an unfair competitive advantage&#8221; over its competition. Yes, Sandusky will forever be synonymous with the boogey-man, but he was a football coach, and concretely evaluating how he could influence players&#8217; football IQ and morale simply isn&#8217;t possible, let alone to the degree that his presence would be deemed unfair, particularly at a school known historically for its defense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the camp where I do believe that PSU as an institution did indeed fail from a LEGAL standpoint, but legal questions are handled by the justice department, not the NCAA. I resist saying that PSU failed from a &#8220;moral&#8221; standpoint because we&#8217;re talking about the NCAA, a billion-dollar industry, and I have yet to encounter such an industry that I would consider pristine in its business practices, and I am not the kind of person who engages in the mental gymnastics of convincing myself that one injustice is of greater importance than another, and therefore, should accrue penalties accordingly. I didn&#8217;t think that Michael Vick&#8217;s dog-fighting ring was a big deal. But Uncle Sam did, and that is something many fail to remember, if not understand completely: Vick did not do time for the dog fighting. For that alone, he would have been placed on probation with a heavy fine, and maybe community service. House arrest at the worst. He went to jail because the monies that were circulated in the dog fighting operation were <em>his</em>, and the IRS did not receive its cut. </p>
<p>But back to PSU and Sandusky, &#8220;He shouldn&#8217;t have been there&#8221; does not justify the hammer the NCAA threw down. </p>
<p>The least of the sanctions is the $60 million-dollar fine (I say this because, of course, I&#8217;m a high-roller, right?). If I am getting my facts correct, is the equivalent to the total annual earnings the university produces via its football program. Stiff, but not insurmountable. The university will be paying it over the course of several years rather than how the NFL fines its players by taking the money directly from the check. And of course, with trustees in play, we&#8217;re technically dealing with inexhaustible resources. </p>
<p>That four-year bowl ban is huge. HUGE! We&#8217;re talking, if you come to Penn State as a senior, you might never have a post-season (red-shirts considered). If by some miracle Penn State were able to go undefeated, it would be a profound joke because they could not be considered champion (Behold: A half-decade of SEC dominance has finally convinced the NCAA that it does care about a true champion and is moving toward a <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8099187/ncaa-presidents-approve-four-team-college-football-playoff-beginning-2014" target="_blank">four team playoff</a>). Of course this will cripple recruiting. What 5-star athlete would commit career suicide by choosing a school with such a scarred reputation? There is no appeal, no extra luster. No promise of leaving the frigid midwest in late December and early January for Florida or California.  </p>
<p>There is then the scholarship reduction, from 85 total to 65 for four years. It isn&#8217;t as devastating as the experts claim. Yes, you need and want depth on your teams, and it would be ideal to secure talent for the future, but again, you are not going to be able to attract top-tier talent if they have no chance of competing against the best, playing &#8220;under the lights&#8221; as we say, Prime Time after the Christmas leftovers have been devoured. Without the bowl ban, however, I might think that PSU would feel the aching impact of its scholarship reduction. A team has to field eleven guys at a time. Twenty-two for offense and defense, another fifteen for special teams (unique kicker and punter included, return specialists as well) makes for thirty-seven players in total. Throw in substitutions, and I&#8217;ll give you fifty players, with fifteen to spare for 65. A football program can manage, but yes, they will be relegated to mediocrity. </p>
<p>All of these sanctions are more or less severe. &#8220;Worse than the Death Penalty&#8221; some have said. Others, &#8220;You WISH you were dead.&#8221; But I sincerely do not believe that any of them are as myopic as what the NCAA did to PSU&#8217;s golden calf. </p>
<p>The last penalty is a &#8220;legacy&#8221; penalty, one that impacts Joe Paterno&#8217;s (posthumous) reputation. I seriously wonder if the NCAA remembered who performed the molestations. If we want to render &#8220;enabler&#8221; as a synonym for an accomplice, then we&#8217;re now talking about the patrons and owner of bars as culpable for drunk driving friends and patrons. It is a reach. </p>
<p>The NCAA vacated 112 PSU wins, dating back to 1998 when Jerry Sandusky was the defensive coordinator and Mike McQueary was quarterback.  </p>
<p>Let that sink in for a moment.</p>
<p>Done? Ok. Now we know that the NCAA is trying to send the nation the message that &#8220;the university establishes an athletic culture and daily mindset in which football will never again be placed ahead of education, nurturing and protecting young people&#8221; as Mark Emmert has said. That&#8217;s fine, as most of the penalties entail, but altering the wins record is a superfluous gesture. What purpose does it serve? Ensuring that Joe Paterno will not be associated with being one of the greatest NCAA coaches of all time?  Records are one thing, but memories are another, and the NCAA has no MiB Neuralyzers for those who have been positively impacted by the sixty-two years Paterno was at Penn State, and they are legion.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Pogue</strong> spends his time spoiling the fun by taking the joke too seriously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re reading this then you probably already know. . .</p>
<p>The <del>Flyers WEST</del>, ahem, the LA Kings, a ragtag crop of former Flyers and their pals, have sold their souls to someone other than the Devil, apparently, and claimed the Stanley Cup for themselves &#8212; and a coast that barely knows what ice is.</p>
<p>But I’m not bitter (I’m a little bitter), I’m hopeful.</p>
<p>The Kings can have Mike Richards and Jeff Carter (and Simon Gagne, etc.) because the Flyers have Eric Wellwood, someone that few people outside of Philly have properly noticed.</p>
<p>There are few speed metaphors that don’t sound so clichéd they obscure the phenomenon they intend to express, but the first time I noticed Wellwood, it really seemed like he’d been slingshot across the ice.</p>
<p>“Who is that guy?” I asked my dad as we sat, just above center ice at the Wells Fargo Center, watching Wellwood streak back and forth across the ice so fast it looked like he was traversing a frozen kiddie pool. He’d just been called up from the Adirondack Phantoms.</p>
<p>Wellwood is not to the Flyers what Chris Kreider promises to be for the Rangers. He’s not the next Kid with a capital S. No, he’s not that kind of rookie, but since that early March game I’ve been watching Wellwood closely. Here’s what I’ve noticed: Wellwood scores goals, but he isn’t a goal scorer &#8212; yet. Sometimes he overskates the puck, slicing past the black disc on breakaways even when the defenders are so far behind him the cameraman must pan away to locate them.  And often, when he does shoot, the puck seems magnetically compelled to hit the goalie square in the chest padding.</p>
<p>That’s probably frustrated a lot of Flyers fans this year, exhausted by half-raised arms repeatedly drooping to their sides after watching him dart out on many a rip-roaring breakaway with no impact on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>But I find possibility, not frustration in those youthful misses. What’s more important to me is that he is always there, even if he’s there before the play actually arrives. He’s so quick and fluid you’d imagine his movement could resurface the ice better than any Zamboni.</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.philly.com/2012-03-23/sports/31229935_1_riemsdyk-claude-giroux-eric-wellwood">Philly.com called him an “elevator player”</a> for his ability to flit between lines, using his skating skill to make himself a presence. You can imagine that despite his novelty, any of his linemates feel comfortable and confident to have him on their line, even if he doesn’t put one in.</p>
<p>I love his energy, reliability, tempo, and commitment. I love that he is a utility player, not an attention hog.</p>
<p>I love the way he skates hockey. That’s right: skates hockey. That’s what he does.</p>
<p>But I have to be honest. On some level, I think I see so much potential in Eric Wellwood because I don’t just appreciate his playing style, I identify with it.</p>
<p>As a competitive figure skater turned high school hockey player, I was a fast and confident skater. Transitioning between defense and offense was no problem for me because no matter where the play was, I was usually in the fray, backchecking or forechecking with the sort of spring in my stride you only see in people who learn to skate with a toepick.</p>
<p>But to this day, skating is mostly where the confidence ends as my body, the stick, and the puck struggle to achieve something approximating synergy.</p>
<p>In a sport where skating ability is assumed, and goal scoring and fighting are paramount, a young player with so much grace and strength on his feet alone is refreshing and auspicious for the Flyers &#8212; and maybe just a tiny bit validating for me?</p>
<p>For Wellwood, it suggests there’s plenty more skill where those wheels came from.</p>
<p>The hands and the timing will come for Wellwood as he collects more NHL experience, ideally with the Flyers. With the help of a collection of forceful and impressive young teammates, I predict Wellwood could be the unsung, but invaluable engine of a team with a Stanley Cup in its future.</p>
<p>You heard it here first.</p>
<p>So this year, because of Eric Wellwood, when anyone says, “Better luck next year!” I actually believe it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A spate of coaching changes rocked the NHL during the regular season. The litany of leadership switches landed ESPN’s front page on the regular and at the time I remember thinking: “Is this really going to help?”</p>
<p>There are a zillion good reasons to fire a coach, but seven firing/hiring stunts in about two months raised eyebrows. Was it groupthink, coincidence, or just a lot of pot-stirring?</p>
<p>In reality and fairness, each of the coaches should get a full season in behind the bench before being evaluated. But if we’re going to peek early, now that we’re more than half way through the Stanley Cup Playoffs (although in my world they are already over) it’s an interesting time to tentatively take stock.</p>
<p>Of the eight teams that swapped coaches, five &#8212; the Hurricanes, the Canadiens, the Ducks, the Maple Leafs, and the Blue Jackets &#8212; didn’t make it to the playoffs.</p>
<p>Of those that did see the postseason &#8212; the Capitals, the Blues, and the Kings &#8212; only L.A. is still in contention with the third round underway.</p>
<p>Even if the L.A. Kings win the Stanley Cup, the results make it pretty tough to draw many conclusions about coaching changes and postseason success this year.</p>
<p>What the coaching switch has done so far is made for some soap opera-style drama &#8212; two teams are currently coach-less &#8212; so we can talk a little bit about the old default strategy of stirring the pot.</p>
<p>The Montreal Canadiens were terrible this year, but Randy Cunneyworth, who was brought in to replace Jacques Martin, stirred Hab nation to a boil. Cunneyworth is already back out the door &#8212; not because the Canadiens were bad, although they were, but because he can&#8217;t speak French. With a losing record on the books, the Canadiens still have no idea who’ll be in charge next.</p>
<p>Right now, though, the Capitals are providing even more coaching suspense.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/washington-capitals-after-missing-another-opportunity-have-issues-to-settle/2012/05/14/gIQAdfrcPU_story.html">the <em>Washington Post</em> reported</a> in its postseason recap, the Caps dropped a high-caliber coach in Bruce Boudreau to take a chance on Dale Hunter, who wasn’t even sure he wanted to coach in the NHL.</p>
<p>The Caps had a respectable and downright exciting postseason run (though they barely made it in), but Hunter already resigned his position, even after being lauded for instilling discipline and “accountability” in the streaky team.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/capitals/washington-capitals-after-missing-another-opportunity-have-issues-to-settle/2012/05/14/gIQAdfrcPU_story.html">the <em>Post</em> article</a>, it sounds like the coaching hire has been mired in controversy from the start.</p>
<blockquote><p>“&#8230;the notion that Hunter had implemented sort of magic elixir of a system is a myth. Boudreau was in the process of changing the Capitals’ approach when he was fired for essentially one reason: <a href="http://stats.washingtonpost.com/nhl/playerstats.asp?id=3637&amp;team=23">Alex Ovechkin</a> didn’t want to play for him anymore because &#8212; ironically &#8212; Boudreau began insisting on accountability from everyone, including his superstar. Hunter was a different voice saying many of the same things &#8212; to the team in general and to Ovechkin in specific.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As if Ovechkin weren&#8217;t enough to handle, following the season there were rumors that Alexander Semin, the Capitals other leading forward, didn’t want to remain with the team because, as <a href="http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/7929902/agent-says-washington-capitals-alexander-semin-headed-free-agency">his agent told ESPN</a>,  the team &#8220;decided to change directions.” Now <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/alex-semin-denies-done-capitals-ovechkin-talks-ice-143626606.html">he’s denying those rumors</a>. Still, it’s likely his decision could be influenced the by the coaching pick.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the style and performance of two teams is in utter limbo. If the GMs were hoping to stir the pot (and not just follow the herd), they succeeded. Though not in the way I imagine they planned.</p>
<p>It’s easy to wonder if the Caps and the Canadiens might have been altogether better off keeping the coaches they started the season with. After all, Boudreau was just signed to a two-year contract with the Anaheim Ducks, so couldn&#8217;t Ovechkin have gotten over himself? And I&#8217;ve seen Martin on some lists as a potential Hunter replacement for the Caps, just to make things weirder.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s obviously no way to know.</p>
<p>Inevitably, more coaching switches will go down between now and next postseason, but these two organizations will be the teams to watch. Their ability to weather a revolving door of coaches &#8212; and possibly players &#8212; may help other general managers with their hiring and firing decisions, whether they know it or not. Or at least, a GM might think twice before firing a coach to try and stir the pot.</p>
