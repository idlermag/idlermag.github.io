										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&#8217;s time. Pitchers and catchers have reported to Lakeland. I saw five birds on my run yesterday. The snow is melting. We&#8217;re (allegedly) going to have an early spring.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a day after Valentine&#8217;s, and all I can think about is how much I love the Tigers.</em></p>
<p><strong>LOVE LETTER POSTMARKED MICHIGAN AND TRUMBALL</strong></p>
<p>It’s the legs I fall in love with,<br />
the high knee socks and pants stopping<br />
just at the crest of calf<br />
small bay of knee.</p>
<p>They’re Brandon Inge’s legs<br />
sublime and twitchy at third base</p>
<p>the shudder in Abuelito’s walk<br />
the limp when he shuffled into the Loma<br />
with a mistress at his hip</p>
<p>wondering how I’d have been so surprised<br />
when the man I love with the knees<br />
made of glass<br />
betrayed me.</p>
<p>I must have fallen in love with<br />
Abuelito first, then Lance Parrish,<br />
and now these Tigers</p>
<p>the way every woman in my family<br />
has learned to love any man</p>
<p>stumbling over the positives<br />
(“we were in almost every game”)</p>
<p>waiting for next year<br />
it could always be so much worse<br />
as a friend says, “we could all have one leg.”</p>
<p>Oh, Abuelito, teaching me<br />
to love the lost men before I knew<br />
he was among them</p>
<p>to love them even more the further they went away<br />
when one could only listen through the radio<br />
in the driveway of the old house on Fairmont<br />
Ernie Harwell forever notching the scores</p>
<p>his lovely wife Lulu eternally waiting at home<br />
with dinner still warm</p>
<p>losses stepping upon losses</p>
<p>like the bricks of the new ballpark.</p>
<p>How I waited for them for years<br />
and they couldn’t even<br />
set the record<br />
for most losses in one season</p>
<p>because that, in its own way, would be<br />
a kind of win.</p>
<p>But it’s smaller&mdash;the man at the plate<br />
when every out is a war<br />
and every strike a reason to leave<br />
and every pitch, my love, is a weak ankle<br />
shattering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually it&#8217;s mid-February before this particular bit of ants-in-my-mental-pants begins: the hint of grass I catch scenting the wind when I&#8217;m bringing the dogs indoors; the memory of the particular perfume dirt and sweat and freshly washed uniforms concoct, the way the dirt of the infield lingers so that later, your lips taste like beating the throw; and the <em>déjà vu</em> of the exact bit of butterflies when you&#8217;re waiting in the on-deck circle, tapping the bat against your cleats and going over and over again in your mind what you want to happen when you hit your pitch. </p>
<p>One of my goals this offseason (besides <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/19/the-hot-corner/">leaving the outfield behind and showing up all the other [male] third basemen in the league</a>) was to accomplish something I haven&#8217;t done since high school: hit a triple. Another: to knock a pitch off the fence, with the hope of stretching it into an inside-the-park homerun.</p>
<p>Kirk Gibson was a huge proponent of the power of positive visualization (and he probably still is, and he&#8217;ll need it, taking over the Diamondbacks), and to that end, I&#8217;ve been lulling myself to sleep thinking through the steps of my swing: setup, load, buffer/hands, slot/hips, bat head through the zone, big tall finish. </p>
<p>My coach and I have talked about my approach at the plate this spring, which will differ substantially from my usual &#8220;swing at the first pitch&#8221; approach. Being that I&#8217;ve been the number four hitter for the majority of games in the past year, my first at-bat has got to count&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to be able to burn the outfielders with a pure power display to push them back against the fence and open the field for line drives, etc.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine a better beginning to the season than a hit like <a target="new" href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=12447553">this</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine how much more impressive it&#8217;ll be when it&#8217;s a 5-foot, 2-and-a-quarter-inch lightweight in a skirt rocking a pitch like that. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s atop my daydreaming list. Here&#8217;s hoping Gibby&#8217;s &#8220;see it, believe it, achieve it&#8221; makes it happen. Well, that and all the grueling hard work.</p>
