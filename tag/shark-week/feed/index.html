Too  much.</p></div> But how to celebrate?  </p>
<p>If I had my way I’d gather and lock all my favorite people into a room and we’d gorge on the tasty insides of Discovery Channel television and snack until we were sick!  But, as I am once again in a new state, and with Husband beating the heat in Russia, and Simon Pegg not returning my calls (what? I said I wanted all my favorite people) I was stuck alone at home, glum, on the brink of an epic quadranscentennial week of shark television.</p>
<p>In order to keep my loneliness at bay and maintain my enthusiasm for my favorite week of the year, I decided I would nevertheless celebrate Shark Week on my own by combining two of my favorite things: Sharks and Food (Is this healthy? This might not be healthy).</p>
<p>In a fit of inspiration (and boredom) I began to flesh out my idea for a Shark Week themed treat.  I didn’t feel like carving up a shark watermelon or actively searching out a precise recipe.  I didn’t have the attention span for that sort of nonsense. I decided to wing it with some baking.</p>
<p>Yes, I know baking is usually <a href="https://idlermag.com/author/jkolongowski/">Jill’s area</a>, but I promise I yelled really loud across our great state to ask her if she would be okay with me writing about baking.  I took the silence to mean I should probably just go for it.  </p>
<p>After a late lunch/early dinner of sushi (yes, this was on purpose), I got started.</p>

<p>I gathered my baking supplies and iPod so The Mountain Goats (and sometimes Adele) could keep me company.  I tried not to feel too depressed I was baking for one and instead focused on how awesome this might turn out.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>  I also kept in mind that, in the end, I would be entitled to share my bounty of cupcakes with exactly no one while watching <em>Air Jaws Apocalypse</em> (these are the thoughts that urge me onwards in times of trial, you guys).</p>
<p>The plan was simple:  Make bloody adorable Lemon Shark cupcakes.</p>
<p>I picked a <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-white-cake/" target="_blank">simple white cake recipe</a> and added the zest of two lemons and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, hoping this would all end up as lemony as possible and not gross.</p>
<p>Once the batter was mixed I separated about a half cup of batter away from the batch to dye red.  The rest got blue like Tobias Funke. </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10367" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/13/shark-week-lemon-shark-cupcakes/imag0719/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imag0719.jpeg" data-orig-size="1952,3264" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;PC36100&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1344791941&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.92&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;112&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IMAG0719" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imag0719.jpeg?w=179" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imag0719.jpeg?w=612" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imag0719.jpeg?w=179&#038;h=300" alt="a little bit of red" title="IMAG0719" width="179" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10367" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imag0719.jpeg?w=179&amp;h=300 179w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imag0719.jpeg?w=358&amp;h=600 358w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/imag0719.jpeg?w=90&amp;h=150 90w" sizes="(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px" /> I filled each cupcake well with mostly blue batter, then globbed some red in the middle, wondering if my morbid idea of a fun cupcake was crossing a line… but it was too late!  This was happening!</p>
<p>Once the cupcakes were in the oven I started to clean up, and then realized cleaning sucks and I should have a drink while I washed dishes.  I highly recommend wine (and more Adele) for this part of the solitary baking process.</p>
<p>30 minutes later, the cupcakes were done.  The next thing to do while they cooled was to start fixing the butter cream frosting.  Yes, I know there are ready available frostings I could have bought at the store, but that’s not how I roll.  Don’t tell me how to live my life!</p>
<p>The butter cream was going to take about 20 minutes of mixing, so I stuck the cakes in the fridge to make sure they’d be ready when the frosting was.</p>
<p>Guys? 20 minutes of mixing is a long time to watch a machine spin butter and sugar around all by yourself.</p>
<p>I had some more wine.</p>

<p>Soon the cakes were cooled and the frosting was finished.  After filling the cupcakes with strawberry jam I tried to be one with the ocean as I squeezed my delectable ocean blue (read: as blue as I could get it because I ran out of dye) frosting from my pastry bag into little cupcake sized waves. I added a yummy candy lemon fruit slice dorsal fin on top, and voilà!</p>
<p>Strawberry/Lemon Shark Cupcakes!</p>

<p>The lemon really came through in the cake, and the strawberry jam was strawberry jam so of course that was delicious.  My mother’s butter cream frosting?  Forgeddaboudit.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Sure, they’re not shark cupcakes like <a href="http://store.discovery.com/dc-cupcakes-shark-week-dozen/detail.php?p=375803&amp;v=tlc_shows_dc-cupcakes&amp;ecid=SMM-DSC-00273&amp;pa=SMM-DSC-00273#mkcpgn=fbdsc1" target="_blank">THESE</a> are shark cupcakes, but mine were CONCEPT cupcakes!  I was all alone and I don’t know how to mold fondant!  What do you want from me?  </p>
<p>No, I will not share them!  </p>
<p>My private feeding frenzy ensues!</p>
<p>Happy Shark Week everybody!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a name="note1"></a>1. I am a recreational, not pro baker, so I had no idea how to bake myself just one fancy little cupcake like Kristen Wiig’s character does in <em>Bridesmaids</em>.  Besides, if I only made one cupcake how would I know if a second or third cupcake would be just as delicious?  Or the sixth or the twelfth??  I’m not a wizard!  Unless the cupcakes turn out awesome.  Then I’m a wizard!</p>
<p><a name="note2"></a>2. I am a wizard!</p>

<p>If you’ve been reading, you know <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/01/batman-a-memoir/">how much I love Batman</a>, so sharks are kind of a big deal.  </p>
<p>My fascination with these awesome predators was peaked as a young child with the movie, <em>Jaws</em>.  I hadn’t seen it, but a neighborhood playmate had and she always made us play it.  I don’t know if I even had a good idea of what a shark looked like, I was that young.  All I knew was the ladder laid across the lawn was safe, and if even so much as a toe touched the grass I would die.  It was a seriously scary game.</p>
<p>A few years later my mother finally gave me permission to see <em>Jaws</em> and after that I was officially hooked (unintentional fishing pun. . . maybe).  Could something that huge and awesome and petrifying really exist?  If I touched my toe to the ocean would I be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzv-c6d_Zzs" target="_blank">bitten in half like Quint</a>? For a while, that was my biggest fear, being bitten in half.  I, like so many others, was terrified of sharks because of <em>Jaws</em>, but somehow fascinated by them nonetheless.</p>
<p>When I was eleven I was introduced to the magic of Shark Week while staying at my grandmother’s house during a heat wave.  Mimi had central air and cable, so life was pretty sweet.  Every night my eyes would be glued to the shark documentaries.  I began to learn about what I feared and the fear became a heartfelt appreciation for an animal designed for predatory perfection.</p>
<p>For years after that I made a point to never miss Shark Week.  I was no longer terrified of being bitten in half (I mean, yeah it wouldn’t be pleasant, and I’d really rather not, but hey, if it happens, it happens) but the idea of not watching Shark Week filled me with that same kind of anguish.  I vowed never to miss it.</p>
<p>And then we cancelled cable.</p>
<p>Husband and I rationalized that cable is a &#8220;want,&#8221; not a need. </p>
<p>On the other hand, for me, Shark Week is a NEED.  Knowing this, Husband gave me the 20th Anniversary Collection of Shark Week on DVD, thusly securing his place in my heart forever while proving himself an excellent provider.</p>
<p>But I still long for the new and exciting Shark Week episodes every summer. . . what’s a lady to do?</p>
<p>INTERNET TO THE RESCUE!</p>
<p>For the glory of gnashing teeth and supreme excellence I present for you my Lack of Televised Shark Week Survival Kit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/shark-week/" target="_blank">the Shark Week homepage</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/top-10-shark-jumping-videos/" target="_blank">Sharks jumping!</a> (If this is not some of the most amazing footage you’ve ever seen we can’t be friends.  You must understand:  Sharks are ultimately the coolest.)</li>
<li><a href="http://fuckyeahsharks.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Fuck Yeah Sharks!</a> Not always classy, but still all kinds of awesome.  For instance <a href="http://fuckyeahsharks.tumblr.com/post/230858634/more-of-the-shark-attack-victim-costume-from-erin" rel="nofollow">http://fuckyeahsharks.tumblr.com/post/230858634/more-of-the-shark-attack-victim-costume-from-erin</a> .</li>
</ul>
<p>Salvation also lies with YouTube, where you can watch clips from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?annotation_id=annotation_885904&amp;p=84AC62E942084834&amp;feature=iv" target="_blank">Shark Weeks of yore</a> until your very eyes roll over white with visual feeding frenzied joy.*  </p>
<p>Here you can find: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWEdStaaZyE" target="_blank">Shark Hypnosis!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG5NX7fC8VM&amp;feature=relmfu" target="_blank">Do sharks have a color preference?</a>  An important question, to be sure. </li>
</ul>
<p>BBC Worldwide also has a nice variety of shark-tastic videos, but they’re not all teeth and blood.  Take this clip about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdCI9w3LLoQ&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">the basking shark</a>. And, while I’m not crazy about the narration, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usoMaksp7Qc&amp;NR=1" target="_blank">this clip about Megladon</a> blows my mind. (Thanks, Britain!)</p>
<p>And if you STILL don’t think Sharks rock, then check it:  <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/06/08/137059984/5-songs-for-sharks-that-like-ac-dc?sc=fb&amp;cc=fp" target="_blank">Confirmation by NPR</a>. </p>
<p>We must all strive to live every week like it’s Shark Week.  Thanks to the Internet my summer is complete again. </p>
<p>*Warning: Evil still lurks on the YouTubes and you may, trying to satisfy your craving for more incredible shark footage, be tempted to click on videos with titles like, “Man gets too close to a great white shark and it attacks him.”  Do not click on it.  You will be Rick Rolled.</p>
