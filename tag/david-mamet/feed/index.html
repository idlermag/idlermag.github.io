										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>The shotgun would ignite, and Ella Mae would scream, but Robert Ford would only lay on the floor and look at the ceiling, the light going out of his eyes before he could find the right words.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Finding “the right words” is a quest all writers are intimately familiar with. Everyone knows that it’s not what you say, but how you say it. Dialogue, great dialogue, can be like music, expressing the profound in a manner that can be universally understood and, more importantly, felt. Also, “nobody has gotten a hand job in cargo shorts since ‘nam!” is a pretty funny line.</p>
<p>I can recall times when a great line has saved a scene and, in some cases, an entire movie for me. In the best of times it is a cherry on top, as is the case with the quote preceding this piece. It is spoken by the narrator of <em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert</em> <em>Ford</em> (2007) in the film’s final moments. It is poetic, to be sure, but it is also the perfect summation of the character of Robert Ford, a man so starved for fame and the attention and validation that comes with it that it drove him to murder his idol.</p>
<p>I have mentioned the line, “<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/03/watching-a-sad-movie-why-dont-you-cry-about-it/">Say goodbye to Frankie, Dad</a>”, before, which functions as an exhaling of the long-held breath that is <em>In America </em>(2003). But that film is full of beautiful lines, made all the more beautiful by their context. One such scene involves Johnny, an Irish immigrant grieving the death of his son, playing with his two daughters. He chases them around their sad, dilapidated Hell’s Kitchen apartment blindfolded and crying, “Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Irish woman!” The girls scream with delight, but soon Johnny slips up: “Fee-fi-fo-fum! I smell the blood of an Irish man!” He removes the blindfold and the game grinds to a halt, the girls peering out from their hiding places. He realizes that he was looking for his son. Johnny’s wife approaches.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Play with the girls, Johnny.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As stand alone lines they are unremarkable. Given their context – the idea that life goes on, that these children are still here and they need their father – they are quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Sometimes dialogue can serve to enhance the overall aesthetic of a film, as is the case with the Coen brother’s brilliant <em>Miller’s Crossing</em> (1990). It isn’t so much a gangster film as a film about gangster films, utilizing a stylized form of slang-laden dialogue (Twists = Women. You know, because they get you all twisted) fondly remembered in older films like <em>Little Caesar</em> (1931) and <em>White Heat</em> (1949). While <em>Miller’s Crossing</em> is full of brilliant dialogue, one exchange in particular stuck with me. Tommy, Irish gangster and mob bosses right hand man, has just punctuated a rousing verbal sparring match with a “twist” (a woman) by smashing her vanity mirror. As she casually strolls away, without even turning back to face him, she delivers this final blow:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I suppose you think you raised hell?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Tommy counters with, “<em>Sister, when I’ve raised hell you’ll know it”, </em>but we all know who won that argument.</p>
<p>There are film makers who have come to be at least partially defined by their dialogue. David Mamet, who doubles as a playwright, has a distinctive voice, his dialogue marching to its own beat. Take this exchange from the brilliant <em>Glenngarry Glen Ross </em>(1992):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You got leads. Mitch &amp; Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them. You can&#8217;t close the leads you&#8217;re given, you can&#8217;t close shit, *you are* shit, hit the bricks pal, and beat it, &#8217;cause you are going *out*.</em></p>
<p><em>The leads are weak.</em></p>
<p><em>“The leads are weak?” The fucking leads are weak? You’re weak. I’ve been in this business fifteen years!</em></p>
<p><em>What’s your name?</em></p>
<p><em>Fuck you. That’s my name. You know why, mister? ‘Cause you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight. I drove an eighty thousand dollar BMW. THAT’S my name.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Thomas Anderson’s characters will often make oddly formal, declarative statements. Like when Barry, from 2002’s <em>Punch Drunk Love</em> tells his brother-in-law that he “cries sometimes, for no reason,” then asks, “Can you help me?” His brother-in-law kindly responds by reminding Barry that he is a Chiropractor. There is also the put upon Donnie Smith from <em>Magnolia</em> (1999), who declares that he “has so much love to give. I just don’t know where to put it.”</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but what I’d really like to know is what some of your favorite lines or exchanges of dialogue are, and why? Seriously, don’t just feed me the dialogue. There has to be a reason it resonates with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWvvnn68iB8" target="new">The train robbery sequence</a> that opens <em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em> (2006) is breathtaking. Jesse and his men stand in the woods as their target approaches, its light piercing through the trees temporarily illuminating their hooded faces before they slip back into darkness. Soon, the train slams headlong into the camera pushing it backwards before grinding to a halt, engulfed in steam. Carrying lanterns that create a warm, yellow glow, the men arm themselves and charge forth to board the train. It is a beautiful, elegant sequence and it’s exactly what cinematographer Roger Deakins does, film in and film out.</p>
<p>I remember going into film school with a very limited idea of what a cinematographer does, attributing, like most filmgoers, a film&#8217;s look solely to its director. And while it is true that the director dictates a film&#8217;s look, the cinematographer is the one responsible for executing it. They are, quite literally, the photographers of the film. For a director, having a brilliant, resourceful and creative cinematographer is integral. I made sure to make friends with the best one in our class.</p>
<p>Realizing that cinematography was quickly becoming a favorite subject (even surpassing directing, my chosen focus), I began scanning my favorite films for the credit I had largely ignored up until this point. Roger Deakins’ name came up often. He had been shooting films since the 1980s, mostly in the UK, but it wasn’t until 1990 when Deakins shot his first U.S. film, <em>Mountains of the Moon</em> (1990)&mdash;yeah, I’d never heard of it either&mdash;that things began to really take off.</p>
<p>He soon found himself in the company of Chicago playwright-turned-filmmaker David Mamet on 1991’s <em><a title="Homicide" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1fp9aXfjBU" target="_blank">Homicide</a></em>. Coming from a theater background, Mamet’s directing style is rather straightforward (The star of his films is the dialogue and storytelling), requiring only the basics in regards to camerawork and lighting. A nice job for cred, but any great artist needs to be challenged to truly grow, and for Deakins that challenge came in the form of the two-headed director; Joel and Ethan Coen.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The two headed director &amp; Roger Deakins" src="https://i1.wp.com/collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Cinematographer-Roger-Deakins-image-7.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="217" />My love of Deakins’ work grew out of my love for the Coen brothers and it is safe to say that they have influenced each other over the course of the 11 films they’ve worked on together. Up until they teamed up Deakins’ work had been good, but basic and without much flair. The Coens demanded much more from his camera work, having previously used eventual <em>Men in black</em> (1997) director Barry Sonnenfeld as their cinematographer, whose penchant for big, sweeping camera moves complimented their screwball style at the time.  </p>
<p>Deakins’ first film with the Coen brothers was <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK0WjWlVO9w" target="_blank">Barton Fink</a></em> (1991), a surreal symbolist film about a New York playwright who, upon getting a gig writing for “the pictures” immediately develops writer’s block. Since the Coens almost never set a film in the present, <em>Barton</em> required a certain period feel. Deakins stuck with his normal source lighting techniques (using mostly on-camera light sources, sometimes enhanced off camera), but began using some of the trademark steadicam and dolly moves that would become staples for him. The Coens would eventually push him into more screwball territory with <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_WSCfWIyF0" target="_blank">The Hudsucker Proxy</a> </em>(1994), <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHuyjYJCCOA" target="_blank">The Big Lebowski</a></em> (1998), <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1C2gCXo4Gs" target="_blank">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a></em> (2000), <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7LEI2WCeEQ" target="_blank">Intolerable Cruelty</a></em> (2003) and <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrEAEXFJGo0" target="_blank">The Lady Killers</a></em> (2004).</p>
<p>In addition to experimenting with more dynamic camera work, Deakins also began to explore technology. And while his opinion of it remains that one must never lean on it (“We’ll fix it in post” is <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=114249616" target="_blank">on record</a> as his least favorite saying), it has allowed him to perform certain visual enhancements. The Coen brothers&#8217; <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htxvLcSnOU0" target="_blank">The Man Who Wasn’t There</a></em> (2001) is an elegant black and white period piece that was actually shot on color film and, because it was shot while spring was in full bloom, <em>O Brother</em>&#8216;s greens and yellows were de-saturated in post, giving them a dirtier, fall look.</p>
<p>If I don’t get away from the Coen brothers stuff now I never will (11 films, you remember?), so onward and upward.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Deakins, at work" src="https://i0.wp.com/collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Cinematographer-Roger-Deakins-image-1.png" alt="" width="323" height="231" />Deakins’ classy visual style has made him something of a commodity in the industry. He has worked with the likes of Martin Scorsese (<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW2USm6wTSA" target="_blank">Kundun</a></em>, 1997), Ron Howard (<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjzgkyge5EM" target="_blank">A Beautiful Mind</a></em>, 2001), Sam Mendes (<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvxWLrl_aQQ" target="_blank">Jarhead</a></em>, 2005), M. Night Shyamalan (<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLT6c8VWSpE" target="_blank">The Village</a></em>, 2004) and, well, the Coen brothers. But some of his best work, in my opinion, was created alongside a few lesser known directors. Vadim Perelman’s <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fovfxKGCYzo" target="_blank">The House of Sand and Fog</a></em> (2003) contains some pretty haunting visuals. In particular I remember a chilling shot containing a few streetlights illuminating an early morning fog. The aforementioned <em>Assassination of Jesse James</em>, directed by Andrew Dominik, is a cinematographer&#8217;s dream, filled with stylized lenses, arty lighting and epic scenery.</p>
<p>Roger Deakins has been nominated for a Best Cinematography Oscar 9 times. He has never won. In 2007 he was nominated for both <em>The Assassination of Jesse James</em> and <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOohAwZOSGo" target="_blank">No Country for Old Men</a></em>, but lost to another favorite cinematographer of mine, Robert Elswitt for <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml2Ae2SIXac" target="_blank">There Will be Blood</a></em>. The win is hard to argue with, but come on! Two noms in one year and the poor guy still can&#8217;t get a break! I digress.</p>
<p>I would never expect anyone to go see a film simply because a certain cinematographer shot it (I&#8217;ve done that, for the record. I sat through <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-7iv6-8BRw" target="_blank">Gigli</a></em> in its entirety because Robert Elswitt shot it. I&#8217;m not proud), but I&#8217;m reasonably certain I&#8217;m going to be checking out Roger Deakins&#8217; next project, whatever it is, whomever it&#8217;s directed by. The man always manages to teach me something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s 2011.  Another year bites the dust.  The last thing the world needs is another &#8220;best films of the year&#8221; list, right?  Every film site has one, not to mention the &#8220;official&#8221; lists compiled by SAG, The Hollywood Foreign Press and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (the later of which is <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2009/06/24/2010-oscars-to-have-10-best-picture-nominees/">far too long</a>, but more on that later).  And here I am, too far behind on Hollywood’s current block of must-see films (as usual) to make a best of the year list, and staring at the ranks of my wrap-around-the-block Netflix instant queue, sixty and counting.  Where do I begin?  What’s a fella to do?   It is certainly important to remain current, but my sofa is already under my butt, after all, and my PS3 controller is within reach.</p>
<p>Netflix it is. </p>
<p>At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I don’t know what I’d do without Netflix instant streaming.  As an avid consumer of media, an entertainment glutton, Netflix streaming has become my all-you-can-eat buffet.  Its rapidly growing back catalog has nearly caused me to collapse under the weight of my own excitement and intimidation.  You may recall my post-holiday wish list, wherein I mention my desire to freeze time so that I can catch up on <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/01/the-cinephiles-christmas-list/">EVERY FILM EVER MADE</a> without losing any time?  Well, Netflix can do little about time&mdash;which makes fools of us all&mdash;but they can begin to steadily catalog every film, making them easily accessible from the comfort of my aforementioned sofa.  Netflix is going to make me a film guru. . . and fat and lazy.  That’s okay because people come to gurus, not the other way around.  But I digress.</p>
<p>Since I have spent far more time on Netflix this year than in a theater I have decided to create a very specific “best-of” list in lieu of your standard bit of business.  And so, in no particular order, here is a list of my favorite films viewed in 2010&mdash;but probably made years before&mdash;and viewed for the first time on Netflix instant streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Cropsey" src="https://i0.wp.com/cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2010/06/10/1276186975_5524/539w.jpg" alt="" width="323" height="194" /> <strong><em>Cropsey</em> (2009)<br />
Streamed on 11/04/10</strong></p>
<p>Filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio explore the origins of the childhood Boogeyman they dubbed “Cropsey,” and discover direct links to a real life boogeyman named Andre Rand, who may or may not be responsible for multiple child murders on Staten Island. </p>
<p>It has everything you’d want from a compelling documentary and everything you’d expect from a great horror film.  As the two filmmakers delve deeper into Rand’s case, things become more and more surreal.  I won’t spoil the film with any of the details but, suffice it to say, truth is stranger than fiction.  In this case, it’s also scarier.</li>
<li><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Cloudy with a chance of meatballs" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.blogcdn.com/blog.moviefone.com/media/2009/07/cloudycine1.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="163" /> <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em> (2009)<br />
Streamed on 09/25/10</strong></p>
<p>In the world of computer-animated fare Pixar will always reign supreme, but in 2009 Sony Pictures took a tiny step out of Pixar&#8217;s epic shadow with this one.  Sure, it may not be quite as sophisticated, but it’s damned funny, relatively clever and pretty as hell to look at.  Add in some great voice acting from Bill Hader (underrated), Anna Faris and James Caan and you’ve really got something.  Seriously, I’m surprised I liked this as much as I did too!</li>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Terribly Happy" src="https://i1.wp.com/kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2010/04/08/Terribly_Happy_4_t614.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="245" /> <strong><em>Terribly Happy</em> (2008)<br />
Streamed on 7/16/10</strong></p>
<p>In the time-honored tradition of conveying style via hypothetical copulations I shall declare this film to be the product of David Lynch and Coen brothers coital interactions on Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s sofa.  Wha?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, this is a fantastically strange, dark little Danish film<a href="#note1">*</a> about a Copenhagen cop banished to a small town after being involved in a bit of shadiness I shall not divulge here.  His attempts to start anew are eventually foiled by unwelcoming townsfolk who like to dump their “problems” into a local bog, a little girl who keeps pushing around a squeaky, empty baby carriage in the middle of the night, and his own psychosis.</li>

<p>Oh man, is this a music nerd&#8217;s dream or what?  Jack White, The Edge and Jimmy Page hangin’, jammin’ and talkin’ axes.  Simple and sweet.</p>
<p>There is a bit of weirdness involving Jack White jamming with a child version of himself, but it’s more than made up for with the film&#8217;s killer intro, in which White constructs a makeshift guitar out of a coke bottle, some wire and a wooden plank.  Now <em>that’s</em> rock and roll.</li>

<p>There is no getting around it. David Mamet’s dialog is fast, smart, and sharp as a tack.  I enjoy the hell out of it regardless of the quality of the film it’s in (<em>Redbelt</em> is a bit of a sloppy mess). </p>
<p>If pressed I would admit that you simply cannot beat <em>Glengary Glen Ross</em> (1992) for killer Mamet dialog, but <em>Spartan’s</em> got a coolness factor that shouldn’t be denied.  Take, for example, this bit of machismo dialog:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What they gotcha teaching here, young sergeant?”</p>
<p>“Edged weapons, sir.  Knife fighting”</p>
<p>“Don’t you teach ‘em knife fighting.  Teach ‘em to kill.  That way, they meet some sonofabitch who studied knife fighting, they send his soul to hell.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Bam.</li>
