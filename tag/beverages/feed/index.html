										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Cancer crab July baby born in the deserts of New Mexico, I tend to love the summer. Breezy nautical styles, scoops of ice cream teetering on a sugar cone, sunshine that feels like it&#8217;s baking your body through and through, lazy naps on hot beaches, mmmmmhmm. This year, however, I’ve been itching for fall, even dreaming of it, yearning for it. Summer’s been too hot, too muggy. Where summer can harbor that feeling of freedom, of days off and little jaunts around every corner, this past one has felt too free &#8212; unfettered, unsure. When you’re a perpetual student like I am, fall (even as it’s marked by longer colder nights and withering life) can feel shiny, new, comforting. With fall’s back-to-school rhythm practiced into our bones, even the non-student, I imagine, feels that nostalgic rush as the leaves begin to turn and kids, kinder to college, busy about ruddy-cheeked in un-broken-in shoes. So, though it was just 94 degrees on a September day in Michigan, fall is on the way and it needs to be done right. This is my fall checklist:</p>
<p><strong>1. Imbibe pumpkin spiced (coffee) beverages</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10500" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/pumpkincoffee/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg" data-orig-size="305,363" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pumpkincoffee" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=252" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=305" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=640" alt="pumpkin coffee" title="pumpkincoffee"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10500" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg 305w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=126 126w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=252 252w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p>Personally, I like to indulge in a Starbucks pumpkin spice frappuccino to welcome the fall. The seasonal lifespan of the product makes it exciting when it returns. When you see it there beckoning from the menu board you don’t think, “oh where, oh where, has my summer sun gone?,” you think, “YES, PUMPKINS!” Now, whether you get this particular drink, a hot coffee version, or a pumpkin pie smoothie (yes, those exist at some smoothie shops and they are delicious), you have to time this appropriately. Don’t get over-eager and take in liquid autumn on a day where you can still see those wavy heat lines emanating from your sweaty steaming face. Wait for a sunny day, one where the light isn’t so yellow, in fact it’s just a shade deeper, moving toward amber. Let the wind be just that flavor of breeze that tickles your arm hairs straight up, the one that chills you just enough that you start wondering how all your cardigans are doing. Extra whipped cream is okay, if not strictly required. </p>
<p><strong>2. Purchase and use school supplies</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10501" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/64specimens_1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg" data-orig-size="350,233" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK DX6340 ZOOM DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1155744266&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.5999999046326&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333335071802&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="64specimens_1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=350" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=640" alt="supplies" title="64specimens_1"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10501" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg 350w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>
<p>Since I was a little kid, the school supplies aisle has always been my favorite section of the store. Pencils and pens, pink rubber erasers, crayons and thick tablets of paper all packed and sorted, packaged with the glittery promise of use. Oh, actual glitter is there, too! Do you take your Elmer’s glue in original form, gel, stick, or paste? Not a fan of mucilage or spiral bound notebooks? Though that is incredibly hard to imagine, I suggest you at least drop a few dollars on an inky pen &#8212; there’s nothing like writing with a pen that glides along while it scratches lightly on the page. It makes you feel important and suddenly verbose, busy, and like you’re really leaving your mark on the world. If you have the heart of a dreamer, purchase that tell-tale mustard box of crayons. Pop the top and inhale their waxy scent. Draw precise lines and figures with the perfect pretty tip, or bear down hard in vibrant color. I promise the feeling will taste like fall.</p>
<p><strong>3. Buy a new hoodie or pull out an old favorite</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10502" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/hoodie/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hoodie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=640" alt="hoodie" title="hoodie"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10502" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Something about being an 80s kid and having E.T. etched into your memory makes popping on a sweet soft hoodie feel at once cozy comfortable and like you’re ready for any autumn adventure. Wear this one layer over your clothes on those evenings where bare arms and sundresses begin to fade into memory and you’ll feel instantly protected. Lift the hood to slip into your solitude. Pull the sleeves down over your knuckles; hold the fabric there with your thumbs. Feel the nubby fleece against your skin. Stow some Reese’s Pieces in your pocket. If Bob Ross’ gentle cooing could be formed into a piece of clothing, this it how it would feel against your skin.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be outside</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10503" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/autumnleaf/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg" data-orig-size="507,337" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Getty Images\/First Light&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Maple Leaf and Forest Canopy, Gatineau Park, Quebec.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;56619358&quot;}" data-image-title="autumnleaf" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Maple Leaf and Forest Canopy, Gatineau Park, Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;
" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg?w=507" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg?w=640" alt="outside" title="autumnleaf"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10503" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg 507w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px" /></p>
<p>You aren’t doing fall right if you aren’t out there walking around in it. For me, fall is incredibly contemplative. The colors of the trees are beautiful and they are both high above your head and cushioning your feet. There’s something incredibly insulating about this. Though autumn doesn’t quite offer the pregnant chrysalis-like pause of spring, it does bring a quieter, more melancholic awakening. To do fall right you have to mourn a little, respect the change, notice how lovely it is. Hold a veiny speckled leaf in your fingers. Crack a twig in half. Poke your finger in the dirt. Watch the light break through the branches. Breathe cold air. Feel the gentle bite.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch <em>Grey Gardens</em></strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10504" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/greygardens/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greygardens.jpeg" data-orig-size="444,297" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="GreyGardens" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greygardens.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greygardens.jpeg?w=444" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greygardens.jpeg?w=640" alt="Grey Gardens" title="GreyGardens"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10504" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greygardens.jpeg 444w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greygardens.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/greygardens.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></p>
<p>When you’re not outside, you must curl up on a chair or couch, under a quilt, perhaps with the windows cracked a smidge for what could be the last time this year. Pets snoring or purring at your feet, read a book or watch a movie. This fall, I think <em>Grey Gardens</em> is where I’ll go. The documentary’s distressed browns and not-quite-cheery marigolds mimic the palette and emotional tone of the season. As we all become a little more reclusive in the changing weather, perhaps we can settle in to the devastatingly beautiful fall of a family, their land, and their home. Mother and daughter, both named Edith Beale, reflect on a gilded past and the future that never came while their home and any healthy relations to the outside world begin to crumble. It’s easy to see the gold-tinged beauty of Jackie O. and her Camelot, but I prefer to sit with her cousins, Big and Little Edie, out on their rotting deck &#8212; especially in this, the season of exquisite decay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me be clear that the title of this article is meant to be an exaggeration &#8212; by car, I live a very comfortable two or three minutes from a well-stocked grocery store with plenty of produce and a somewhat self-involved organic food section. (I&#8217;m down with organic foods, but this place is set up kind of weird, with all the organic stuff by itself between the paper towels and the frozen foods. If you&#8217;re looking for something organic, it won&#8217;t be by the regular item, it&#8217;ll be off by itself in the organic section. Me, I tend to just avoid it.)</p>
<p>No, my own private food desert is my apartment.</p>
<p>Like many people in this fine country of ours, I&#8217;m a bit heavier than I ought to be. And, again, without overstating the problem, things of late had been getting worse than better, so there are fewer impulse foods around the house. There is a strategically limited supply of dark chocolate, and cream cheese is strictly rationed. Red meat, already scarce, is gone almost entirely. There&#8217;s a solid supply of chicken breasts and ground turkey, but potato and corn chips are <em>persona non grata</em>.</p>
<p>None of these trends are entirely new to the Craig kitchen, but they have definitely become more pronounced.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing, although not, apparently, good enough. Because, you see, while my waistline has stopped expanding, after a good start, it&#8217;s stopped shrinking as well.</p>
<p>Before I lose you entirely, let me reaffirm that under no circumstances will this become a diet column. I have no interest in trading tips, debating the perfect diet, or passing any judgment on individual foods other than whether or not it makes me happy to put them in my mouth. (I do have such opinions, but like politics and religion, it is often best to keep such things to one&#8217;s self.) In the long run, my goal is to stay the same weight, and one not terribly far from the one I am now.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>
<p>So what do I do? Well, largely, I&#8217;m going to put a bit more time in at the gym, and I&#8217;m going to work to reconcile myself to being just a little hungry all the time until I get there. And that&#8217;s the complaint of which I&#8217;m most ashamed. Too many people deal with real hunger, and I, emphatically, do not equate my position with theirs. I am, however, finding that I do not deal well with that constant gnawing urge, and I&#8217;m looking forward to being done with it.</p>
<p>But there are two cheap tricks that I&#8217;m going to try in order to (hopefully) give me that additional push.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m going to cut liquid calories to an absolute bare minimum. For someone who doesn&#8217;t drink water, well, almost ever, I actually do better than you might expect on this front. Most of what I drink on a day-to-day basis is aspartame sweetened powdered tea or lemonade. (Yeah, it&#8217;s Crystal Light. And yeah, it&#8217;s pink lemonade. What?) However, that Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA has 209 calories per 12 ounces. (The 90 Minute IPA has 294.) And my beer snobbery means that light beers are out of the question, so yeah, beer is kind of out until I reach my goal.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not motivation, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p>And second, carrots. They&#8217;re low in calories, and even better, they&#8217;re incredibly satisfying to chew. And for me, at least, when I&#8217;m hungry, that&#8217;s a huge help. Chewing carrots (or sugar-free gum) at the end of the meal has been a great trick to let my stomach catch up with my mouth. It gives my chompers something to do, and it takes my mind off food.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p>But the sooner I get there, the sooner I get to have interesting food in my house again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Novelty items are popular.  People can’t help buying silly, whimsical merchandise if they think the joke is hysterical or their love for geekery is strong enough.  I am no exception.  I used to own a <a href="http://phonevault.com/catalog/Novelty/FamousCharacters/kermitcs.asp">Kermit the Frog phone</a>.  If the items double as something moderately useful then so much the better! (I’m looking at you, <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/lights/df8c/">Sonic Screwdriver flashlight</a>)  And then there are items that, well, aren’t that great an idea.  They aren’t funny or even useful.  Sometimes they’re just the opposite.</p>
<p>First off: <strong>The gross stuff</strong></p>
<div style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Kitty litter cake" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.slipperybrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kitty-litter-cake.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="221" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Toxoplasmosis, anyone?</p></div>
<p>I’ll never understand pretending food and beverages are bodily waste.  I can go along with red beverage vampire jokes, but confections like <strong>Kitty Litter Cake</strong>  (I could rant about how much I hate the idea of this recipe, but. . . later) and the idea of a glass of fresh urine just aren’t funny to me.  I think it’s downright disturbing. Which is why I can’t conceive of anyone ever wanting or, for that matter, using a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SQG4TU/?tag=047-20">toilet Bowl Coffee Mug</a></strong>. Who has this kind of, uhm, taste?  Is it really SO hilarious to pretend you’re drinking out of the toilet? The only possible reason I could see for owning this mug and using it for beverages is if you’re trying, in an excessively stupid way, to convey that in your opinion the office coffee is, uh, sub-par.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know where to start with the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Whizzer-Novelty-Liquor-Dispenser/dp/B000OKRP2C/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317771640&amp;sr=1-1">Little whizzer Drink Dispenser</a></strong>. It’s “inspired” by an <a href="http://images2.cafemomstatic.com/images/user/gallery/post_1490304_1260128516_med.jpg?imageId=17406720">actual fountain in Brussels</a>, but bottom line, it’s a figure of a urinating child.  If the figure were an adult it’d be an x-rated product.  Adults have the cash flow to be buying this “little man piss” drink dispenser, so the implications of that are pretty bad.</p>
<p>Second: <strong>The stupid stuff</strong></p>
<p>I’m not against low-brow humor.  Bad puns, “that’s what she said,&#8221; and innuendos (heh, heh, in-your-end-o, heh, heh) are not beyond me.  I won’t swear I’ve never laughed at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMvW-_pkX3Q&amp;feature=related">a fart joke</a>, it’s just that I don’t usually, especially if my olfactory sense is being assaulted.   Which is why I find the following products appalling:</p>
<div style="width: 288px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Fire fart" src="https://i2.wp.com/ecdn1.hark.com/images/000/000/628/628/original.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="193" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh, grow up</p></div>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Assets-Novelties-LLC-Mister/dp/B000OCEWGW/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317768639&amp;sr=8-31">Liquid Ass Fart Spray</a></strong> is described as a stink spray, something that sounds like an evil villain mastermind should be in charge of it. More than likely though, it’ll be wielded by that asshole from accounts who thinks farts are the end all be all of hilarity.  Either way, it has to be let off by the buyer somehow.  For $4.25 why not just indulge in a sub-par burrito? Or as one might call it, “Ass Classic”?</p>
<p>Also from the famous (really? Famous? Has ANYONE EVER heard of this?) makers of Liquid Ass:</p>
<p>BARFume – smells like barf!  Get it?!</p>
<p>Tex-Ass – smells like BBQ at first, and THEN ass! *eye roll*</p>
<p>The only possible practical use for these stink sprays would be to spray it around the Toilet Bowl Coffee Mug to teach that unfunny bastard we do NOT drink out of the toilet.</p>
<p>Thirdly: <strong>The dangerous stuff</strong></p>
<p>As far as multi-use elements go, water is tops in my book.  Yes, there’s a lot to do with good old H2O.  Bathing, swimming, relaxing, walking and flying… wait, what?  Walking and flying?  That’s not what water’s for!  Well, maybe with the right technology, which does not describe the next two items on our list:</p>
<div style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="The Flaming Lips in a ball!" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.nola.com/voodoofest_impact/photo/web-lipsjpg-3d94d13f206cb790_large.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="188" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wayne Coyne has one! You should too!</p></div>
<p>One of the two reviews of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZMN8IU/?tag=047-20">Water Ball</a></strong> explains a distinct lack of basic instructions and safety precautions for this human hamster ball.  Somehow you’re supposed to put someone inside this giant plastic ball, inflate it and then toss it on water.  Oxygen is limited.  It can’t be opened from the inside.  How would you exit it without the dastardly laws of physics taking over if a suitable shoreline was unavailable?  How can you even control the damn thing once you’re in it?  I can’t believe this inflatable deathtrap is on the market.</p>
<p>If you’ve got about $100,000 lying around and have a James Bond fantasy, but are afraid of fire, then perhaps what you need is the <strong><a href="http://www.jetlev-flyer.com/en/62868-Where-to-buy">water jetpack</a></strong>.  You may recognize it from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRVspuAJyAY&amp;NR=1">schadenfreude/fail</a>. That video should  be enough to put enough fear of humiliation into a person to avoid this contraption like a room that’s been infiltrated by Liquid Ass.  It seems like an awful high price tag and a lot of unnecessary danger for very little pay off.  On the other hand, I’m a huge fan of The Darwin Awards, so you know what?  I take it back.  Buy a jet pack and a water ball.  Play with the damn things on the ocean.  I look forward to reading the hilarious events of your death.</p>
<p>Lastly: <strong>The incredibly offensive stuff</strong></p>
<p>Here we have merchandise that is just downright inappropriate.  There are some things regarding which enough time has not passed for a joke to be regarded as anything but in bad taste.  Especially when innocent people died for said joke.  Behold:</p>
<div style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="  " title="Gin and Titonic" src="https://i2.wp.com/j.b5z.net/i/u/2075403/i/ginandtitonic_648.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="252" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Seriously, a lot of people died. I need a drink.</p></div>
<p>I know it’s been almost one hundred years since the Titanic sank, and I’m all for puns, but the<strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P8XE5W/?tag=047-20">Gin and Titonic</a></strong> could really ruin a drink for me.  Over 1500 men, women and children drowned and/or froze to death when Titanic sank due to an iceberg (and multiple design flaws).  I don’t think the victims or the survivors and their descendants would appreciate the irony of tiny iceberg and Titanic ice molds. If you think I’m taking this too seriously and should lighten up then please remember not to get all bent out of shape when someone thinks Challenger and World Trade Center inspired fireworks are a hilarious idea.</p>
<p>So the next time you’ve got money to burn and want to make a hilarious purchase to add some whimsy to your life and crack up your friends, maybe restrict yourself to a <strong><a href="http://beardbeanie.com/">beard beanie</a></strong> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kotobukiya-Star-Wars-Carbonite-Silicon/dp/B004R7S9I2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317778881&amp;sr=8-1">Han Solo ice molds</a>. In a worst-case scenario everyone will just think of you as a dork instead of gross, stupid or an asshole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe the first time I tasted prosecco was on the Paris to Milan Artesia night train. It’s called the Stendhal service and that’s a perfect name for a journey between these two cities. Stendhal was the pen name of Marie-Henri Beyle, a French writer well known for his unrequited love for  Mathilde, Countess Dembowska, whom he met while living in Milan.</p>
<p>Stendhal’s book, <em>On Love</em> is the reaction to this experience. It’s an attempt to dissect romantic love in a logical, level-headed way. As a Frenchman suffering from failed Italian-style desire, he made a worthy attempt. </p>
<blockquote><p>To make this course of action clear to my French readers, I must explain that in Italy, a country very far away from us, people are still driven to despair by love.</p></blockquote>
<p>We left Paris Bercy station in the early evening, scheduled to arrive in Milano Centrale station the next morning. I was feeling in a champagne state, but the dining car waiter suggested in French we should try an Italian sparkling wine instead, to put our hearts and minds in the mood of our destination.</p>
<p>Prosecco is dry, lemony, and bubbly. It’s created from predominately Prosecco grapes in the northern Veneto region of Italy in the foothills of the Alps on the opposite side of Italy from where we were going. We missed most of the scenery through the Alps since we traveled at night, but it was April. It was quite chilly and we saw snow on the ground whenever we slowed down.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Milan it was pouring rain. Our hotel, the most luxurious I’ve ever stayed in, was only a few blocks away.  After unsuccessfully trying to flag a taxi for more than a half-hour, we started to walk, umbrellas in one hand, one black, tourist-style, small, wheelie suitcase each in the other.</p>
<p>We arrived, dripping wet like two drowned rats, at the grand entrance of Hotel Principe di Savoia at 6:30 am. The bellman were not quite sure whether to laugh or cry at the sight of us. Rain puddles sloshed beneath us at the reception desk. I’m not sure if it was my hotel Platinum status or our pathetic state that forced the fastest check-in I’ve ever experienced, especially for an Italian hotel so early on a Saturday morning. </p>
<p>They showed us to a wondrous room. My traveling companion called it the Gianni Versace suite because of the gilt, multiple mirrors, and heavy velvet brocade of the bedding and draperies. </p>
<p>After a hot shower, a nap, and a late room service breakfast, we ventured out. The sun was shining.  Our first stop was the “quadrilatero della moda&#8221; where the luxury brands of Italian fashion live: via Manzoni, via Montenapoleone, via della Spiga and via Sant&#8217;Andrea. A lovely lunch included more prosecco.</p>
<p>When I came back to the U.S. the brand of prosecco I saw most often in the liquor stores was <a href="http://www.mionettousa.com/prosecco-il.php" target="_blank">Mionetto “IL” Prosecco D.o.c. di Treviso</a>. It’s a black bottle with a distinctive golden swirl. I drink Prosecco almost every time I eat Italian, at least as an aperitif. Some of the better restaurants surprisingly don’t serve it, since it’s not well known.  </p>
<p>It should be.</p>
<p>Although there are other very fine versions available, this Mionetto is not expensive, typically about $12.99 here in Chicago. If you’re a wine snob you might think that’s because the bottle is sealed with a generic 21-teeth crown cork bottle cap rather than a traditional foil covered cork inside the wire housing called the &#8220;cage&#8221;. The champagne ceremony of flipping up the wire ring of the cage, turning it exactly six half-turns counter-clockwise, freeing the cage from the neck of the bottle and then loudly popping a cork is lost. </p>
<p>But what you gain in fun bubbles is worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They say you can’t go home again. For me it’s too easy. I now live two doors down from the house where I grew up. My parents have been keeping tabs on the neighborhood for fifty years.</p>
<p>It’s that kind of continuity, unique to fewer and fewer communities in the United States, that binds us together. And that’s why a large turnout was expected for our all-years Catholic grade school reunion this past weekend. </p>
<p>A $40 ticket purchased from the church rectory in advance bought a full buffet and all the &#8220;well&#8221; drinks, beer, and wine you could handle. Chicken, mostaccioli, BBQ beef sandwiches. Or maybe it was pork. Trust me this was not a fussy crowd. </p>
<p>“Well&#8221; drinks meant no premium brand vodka, scotch, or gin. Nothing fancy or frilly. I did see martinis, but they were served in a tumbler. Mix the distilled generic brand liquor of your choice with 7-Up, Coke, tonic, orange juice or, maybe, pineapple juice if you’re my sister. Beer selection was a choice of various bottles, all of them domestic, except Corona &#8212; which might as well be domestic.</p>
<p>Wine &#8212; I didn’t even look &#8212; was probably Gallo jug.</p>
<p>I chose Michelob. Because that’s what we always drank as kids &#8212; I started drinking at 14 &#8212; and I wasn’t planning on having very many. The selection was limited to Ultra . Only 95 calories. </p>
<p>Because now we’re worried about calories.</p>
<p>Recently there was a big controversy over the possibility that Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, was going to discontinue selling Old Style beer. Wrigley Field patrons care about Old Style based on faux nostalgia rather than genuine, basic, blue-collar draft beer chops. The Pabst Brewing Company still produces all the old-fashioned, now in fashion with the hipsters, beers that used to be made by family-owned breweries. Old Style is what we drank in cans at my uncle’s tavern across the street from the old Comiskey Park. </p>
<p>When we were sixteen.</p>
<p>Pabst Blue Ribbon, Blatz, Strohs, and Old Style were our go-to beers when short of cash or when drinking in volume. But we all had jobs. I worked the cash register at the local hamburgers, hotdogs, and Italian beef joint across from Tony&#8217;s, the liquor store. Our boyfriends stocked Tony&#8217;s shelves. And sometimes they slipped a case or two out the back on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>The classic brands came in cans. Huggies hide cans well for drinking clandestinely behind the school, at the forest preserve, sitting on a park bench or, our favorite, in the cemetery. But when we didn’t have to worry about being seen we preferred Michelob or, for special occasions, Heineken.</p>
<p>It all came back to me as I watched the night progress at the reunion. I could have predicted who would be left at 11:00pm for last call. Some were trying to decide which bar to go next. There are plenty to choose from on Western Avenue and the beer is still cheap. I knew where that would lead. Once you agreed to go to the next place, it was impossible to leave before closing. In the old days that would have then led to breakfast at 24-hour Karson&#8217;s. But Karson&#8217;s isn&#8217;t there anymore.  </p>
<p>When we were in college, I called it “diminishing marginal returns.” At that age it was about going home with someone. If your plan wasn’t made by last call &#8212; some bars in Chicago serve until 5am on the weekends &#8212; no good would come of staying just a little longer. The later it got, the worse the outlook.</p>
<p>I figured it was time to go home.</p>
<p>I was thinking as I said goodbye that my family was lucky no one had ever landed in jail or the emergency room because of alcohol. Many families we grew up with had not been so fortunate. More than a few folks we knew ended up in rehab, Alcoholics Anonymous, and Narcotics Anonymous by the time they got out of college and started a family. We all have friends who, because of booze or drugs, are already gone. It was a sobering to look around and see how many that were still lingering now carry a gun as a Chicago Police or Sheriff’s Police officer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell for tequila long before I ever traveled to Mexico. From what I remember &#8212; although tequila memories are always a bit blurry &#8212; I’ve never actually fallen because of tequila. That honor goes to the Mexican dark beer, <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/75/667" target="_blank">Negra Modelo</a>. Cerveza oscura  &#8212; dark beer &#8212; was my drink of choice on the weekends in <a href="http://www.stuinmobiliaria.com/ixtapa-zihuatanejo-costa-grande-guerrero/" target="_blank">Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo</a> after I started living and working in Mexico.  </p>
<p>A story for another day. . .</p>
<p>When I was in high school and college my liquor was whiskey. It wasn’t until I graduated and started working that I tasted tequila. My best friend on my first job, as an internal auditor at the first “too big to fail bank” <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/04/18/mckenna-speaks-at-american-accounting-assn-public-interest-conference/" target="_blank">Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago</a>, was the oldest of five children of Mexican immigrants. Maria invited me to all the family’s gatherings. </p>
<p>Tequila was an important part of parties at their house, and the men &#8212; and Maria’s mother, sisters, and aunts – drank tequila shots to celebrate the new year, a birthday, a baptism, or just about any happy occasion and all the sad ones. Maria’s father, Rodolfo, taught me a rule of thumb for drinking tequila – one is never enough and three is too many.</p>
<p>When I started working in Mexico following that rule kept me safe.</p>
<p>I went to Mexico – and Argentina and Brazil – in 1997 as the project leader for J.P. Morgan’s Year 2000 (Y2K) project in Latin America. At that time, I was working for KPMG Consulting. Later I would go to work for J.P. Morgan directly in Latin America so I could stay on the project and in the region. I returned to the states at the end of 2001 after returning to BearingPoint, the successor firm of KPMG Consulting, once the Y2K project was completed.</p>
<p>During the early years of the project, 1997-1998, I worked primarily in Mexico. It was closer to New York, where the JP Morgan global team was based, and I preferred Mexico to Brazil or Argentina. Not that I didn’t like the other two countries. They have their charms, but Mexico was where I felt most comfortable.</p>
<p>I was the boss. As a woman, a foreign woman, you might think I had a hard time. Not at all. I could read and write Spanish fairly well when I arrived and worked hard to learn how to understand spoken Spanish and to speak as an educated professional during my time there. </p>
<p>My team, all men, were a big help in achieving that goal. The best way to learn a language, after loving with it, is to socialize using it.</p>
<p>The majority of the team came from the local KPMG offices and the rest from the local J.P. Morgan offices. There were a few women working with me in Argentina and Brazil, but in Mexico City it was all men. Management assigned primarily the younger professionals to help me with the tedious testing and documentation tasks needed to successfully complete the projects in each country before the start of the new millennium.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, KPMG is KPMG all over the world. We worked hard and played harder. The Mexican professionals treated me like a queen. We celebrated a project milestone or just the end of a long week together and I never had to eat alone if I didn’t want to. I never felt alone or unsafe in Mexico City. </p>
<p>One of the restaurants we liked to go was Mezzanotte, in Polanco on Avenida Presidente Masaryk. It was great because they had excellent Italian food and then, later in the evening, it turned into a nightclub. If you stayed through dinner you could keep your table and we danced the nights away in between them.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to taking tequila “la bandera,&#8221; Mexican flag style at Mezzanotte. The waiter serves three shot glasses. One has tequila blanco, another has lime juice for the green of the flag and the third contains sangrita, a spicy tomato juice chaser for red. I don’t know if it’s traditional but the guys always made me shout “Viva Mexico!” when we drank “la Bandera.”  </p>
<p>In short time I realized I really liked the taste of tequila. That can be a dangerous and expensive bow to the local culture, since I was never served less than a reposado, or aged 100% agave tequila. More often they ordered an añejo, the finest. I acquired a preference for <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a>, which is wasted if not taken straight. But a lady, and the boss, should not routinely drink her staff of young men under the table via tequila shots. It’s both tacky and a career-limiting move.  </p>
<p>Another restaurant, La Valentina in Polanco , was where the team introduced me to <a href="http://www.cocktailtimes.com/original/don_paloma.shtml" target="_blank">the Paloma</a>. Take a tall glass, some ice, a generous helping of tequila and Squirt. The carbonation in the lemon-lime flavored Mexican version of Squirt &#8212; much more pungent than Squirt available in the United States &#8212; serves as an inebriation antidote. You can have the flavor of tequila, and much more of it than doing straight shots, and remain upright for much longer. This approach, too, has its limits but I thankfully never reached them in any unpleasant way.</p>
<p>Another place the guys took me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Garibaldi" target="_blank">Plaza Garibaldi</a>, the <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2007/12/31/musings-on-the-eve-of-the-new-year/" target="_blank">center of mariachi</a> in Mexico City. The best cantina &#8212; and one a woman is allowed to enter &#8212; is <a href="http://www.planeteyetraveler.com/2010/06/24/cantina-crawl-salon-tenampa/" target="_blank">Salón Tenampa</a>. The only thing you drink there is tequila and only by the shot. All the better to get drunk enough to sing along. I’m still a big fan of mariachi. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mofzQYHbOw" target="_blank">“Volver, volver, volver a tus brazos otra vez. . .”</a> </p>
<p>I didn’t go home to Chicago much during this period. The Christmas holiday is the one time I always went back to cold, snowy Chicago. After a while the city seemed so much less warm than Mexico. I always picked up a bottle of very good tequila &#8212; something different each time but always an añejo &#8212; for Christmas at Maria’s and shots with her father. Each year I also bought Cuervo’s annual Reserva de la Familia special edition tequila in a wooden box hand-painted by a Mexican artist. My favorite one is <a href="http://www.cuervo.com/products/box.aspx?artist=grabados-de-artemio" target="_blank">the first, 1997</a>, by Artemio Rodriguez because it’s a typical Mexican drawing, white on blue.</p>
<p>There’s a bottle of <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a> in my cabinet now. There’s also a bottle of Cuervo for margaritas and one of those long, tall, blue bottles containing <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/reposados/corralejo-tequila-reposado.html" target="_blank">Corralejo Reposado</a>.</p>
<p>I have my tequila but I do miss <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/02/02/special-for-forbes-a-business-travel-story-about-mexico/" target="_blank">Mexico</a> mucho.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re the first thing I think of in the morning. I’ve never smoked, but I imagine it’s a similar craving. Should I make a pot or run to the corner café? When my head is heavy with sinusitis, it’s impossible to lift it off the pillow.  On these days I need coffee to keep me from blowing my brains out.</p>
<p>If I drank the night before, I can mistake the dull throbbing for a hangover. But I rarely drink enough, unfortunately to be hung-over. If only I could drown my sorrows and my sniffles in enough Vicodin and very fine wine.</p>
<p>Gulp two extra-strength Tylenol from the bottle on the nightstand. When I wake up listening to the Pacific ocean in Mexico, I always feel better. It’s the sea air and the ability to blame tequila for whatever hurts.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine coffee life before Starbucks. When I travel to New York or Washington D.C., they feed my beast, quickly and conveniently. Here in the U.S., a four-shot, venti, vanilla latte is always around the next corner, never more than a few steps away.</p>
<p>When I lived in South America, it was Starbucks that I missed the most. It’s impossible to get a take-out coffee to save your life in Argentina or Brazil. In Buenos Aires, if you ask at a café for a coffee “para llevar”, that is, “to go”, they squint their eyes and give you a very funny look.</p>
<p>“To go? But why? Relax, sit down, take an espresso and then go to work. It can wait. ”</p>
<p>There is no driving and drinking in Latin America. Coffee that is. Only a foreigner would think about walking down the street with a paper cup full of espresso.</p>
<p>When I order my four-shot drink in Chicago, sometimes iced in warm weather, the baristas do a double-take. “Are you ok?” they ask. “Whole milk? Are you sure?”</p>
<p><em>Really</em>…If I order four shots of espresso, cut with a double dose of vanilla syrup, do you really think I give a flying tomato about fat calories?</p>
<p>Every once and a while I try to cut down. I hear caffeine is bad for women in all sorts of ways. But I’ve been drinking coffee since I was ten or eleven. My grandmother served it as a warmer-upper when we stayed over, in brown melamine teacups.  My mother fed it to all six of us before school on cold mornings.</p>
<p>The electric coffeepot is always perking at my parents’ house, even though now, because of my father’s heart, they drink decaf.  A percolator keeps the coffee hotter than a drip coffeemaker. And we always drink our coffee with half and half.  I just can’t stomach it with milk or, god-forbid, 2% or skim. My sister takes her coffee with Equal, a bow to a diet of sorts, but good old regular sugar is still my vice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I drink too much on an empty stomach at the office, my knees start twitching uncontrollably under my desk. But the absence of coffee in my life feels like an absent lover. My head aches, my limbs go limp, and I crave, too much, a pillow and my blanket to hide from the sunrise.</p>
