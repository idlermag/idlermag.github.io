										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always been a great player of pretend. I love telling stories. As I child, I was often accused of having an overactive imagination. When I’d play outside with the neighborhood kids, I’d go beyond the typical “cops and robbers” and do “mob boss versus grizzled detective who’s getting too old for this stuff,” and add a subplot about a wandering preacher whose charisma dupes them both.</p>
<p>I’d perform soliloquies for Stitch, my teddy bear. My G.I. Joes took part in an ever-evolving saga of espionage. My Barbie dolls were the members of a huge and convoluted family tree, and participated in all the drama that comes with it. My mom’s Barbie was the mom. She still wore her makeup and hair exactly the way she did when she was a teenager herself. </p>
<p>Can’t you see it just dates you, Babs? You don’t look any younger!</p>
<p>I was also a voracious reader and movie watcher. I especially dug sci-fi. I saw <em>Alien</em> for the first time when I was eight, and apart from gifting me with the image that still pops up in my nightmares (the baby xenomorph birthing itself from John Hurt’s chest, obviously), it also introduced me to Our Ripley of Nostromo, the first female film character I found entirely relatable. I mean, Leia was close, but at the end of the day? I wanted to be Han Solo. Soon enough, I was calling my cat “Jonesy” and pretending she and I were going into cryostasis when we’d go to bed.</p>

<p>She always wanted to sleep directly on my head though, the little facehugger.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be great, I thought, to up the ante? To actually feel like I was on a spaceship? To wear the right clothes, say the right words, and be surrounded by a bunch of people doing the same? To feel really immersed in these worlds? Heck yes, it would. So I decided to become an actor.</p>
<p>And I did, and it was great. I made people laugh and cry (mostly laugh). I met the people who make up my core group of friends. I met my husband. I made contacts that got me my first paying gigs in New York. I told a lot of stories.</p>
<p>However, as with most things that are awesome, there was a catch. While little Sara assumed it was the actors who were at the center of the make-believe, actor Sara discovered it was really the audience (as of course it should be). </p>
<p>It may look like she’s on the deck of spaceship, but she’s actually standing in front of several panels of green spandex. Her costume is held together in the back by safety pins. Half the time, she’s not even talking with the person who appears in the scene with her. Theatre offers her more immersion, but then it’s a constant exchange of energy with the audience, because they’re actually there in the room. That energy exchange is important and wonderful and absolutely thrilling, and I miss it dearly, but there came a time when I realized I was the one who wanted to be fooled.</p>
<p>Enter Commander Shepard, stage right. </p>
<p>I was already well acquainted with the immersive qualities of video games, but <em>Mass Effect</em> took dead aim at my childhood fantasies and struck true. An epic space fantasy spanning three games, where decisions from the first affect outcomes in the second and third, it offered me the chance to be the badass space explorer I always wanted to be. </p>

<p>I stalked the decks of the Normandy. I donned space armors and wielded high tech weapons. I befriended my crew. Flirted with them, too. Some of them died, and I mourned them. I helped some people, and hurt some others. I saved the galaxy. For the most part, I was the good gal, but I followed my own code &#8212; sometimes you just have to use the Renegade interrupt option and blow up that gas tank your opponent is too busy monologuing to notice.</p>
<p>“Boring conversation anyway,” you’ll say out loud from your couch. </p>
<p>A video game tells a story for an audience of one. A great video game lets that audience help tell it. I may never get a chance to play Ripley in the <em>Alien</em> reboot (though I am totally available, Hollywood), but my Shepard ain’t a half bad substitute. Especially because she’s mine.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to tell stories, and I’ve got no plans to stop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her 2009 comedy album <em>Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome</em>, Maria Bamford prefaces a bit about aging with the following warning: “This joke might fall under the category of something only I enjoy.”  This is one of those cases where it’s funny ‘cause it’s true.  Though I find Bamford’s work hilarious, playful, darkly intelligent, and fun, I’ve noticed that when I try to share her genius with friends I get a less than enthusiastic response.  Think of how people don’t want to try sushi. “Oooh, raw fish? Aah.  Huh. Wrapped in seaweed, too, I see.  No, no, thanks, but you just eat that yourself.”  That face that’s trying to be polite, but disgust is creeping all over their visage.  Their head shaking a “no,” their hand gesturing “halt, there will be no sushi in this gullet!”  This is oftentimes the reaction I get from sharing Maria’s material.  But, to be fair, Bamford (aka The Bammer) isn’t your typical stand-up. If you want simple laughs unpacking the quirky inanity of airplane food, men vs. women, black guys drive like this/white guys drive like this, well, you’ve come to the wrong comedy show.</p>

I could go on.  Though one could lazily label her silly, just a weird voice lady, or as one radio deejay so inanely misread her,  a “schizophrenic,” if you listen closely you might hear how her woman of a million voices act quite brilliantly sketches what it feels like to be Maria &#8212; to inhabit her skin, her space, her mind.  And if we’re honest, we might find that all her “weird” characters, offbeat thoughts, songs and reactions are pretty familiar to our own experience.  You know that you at your core?  The one that likes popping zits, eating ice cream for breakfast, narrating the thoughts of your maniacally evil cat in Broadway style with jazz hands and aplomb?  Yeah, that’s the self we usually tidy up and edit out and that’s the one that Maria shares with us in public, on stage.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I actually had the (strange) fangirl pleasure of seeing Maria live in Ann Arbor, MI and it wasn’t exactly what I expected.  First off, I’ve always seen comedians perform in theaters, casino auditoriums, or arenas. The venues seemed to support the idea that the player we came to see was an artist, someone valuable, someone famous, or “big.”  However, the Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase is a lot more like (or at least trying be like) the comedy clubs you’ve seen intermittently on <em>Seinfeld</em> or <em>Louie</em>.  Small cramped quarters. Brick walls. Teeny tiny tables. The audience is ushered in two people to a table and every table is crammed into a semicircular formation around a small spare stage decorated only with a saddish mural of a big city.  The cityscape looks like stage dressing for a high school play.  I could easily walk up to the stage, take the mic, do a jig if I so desired.  There’s none of that spatial separation &#8212; none of those markers that suggest that the performer is not like me, is better.  This makes me sad for Maria.  “She deserves better than this!” my mind screams, and a nervous knot ties in my belly.</p>
<p>I switch seats with my friend Erin &#8212; she joining my husband at a table for two, I filling a half seat next to strangers. And then the fun begins.  A drunk crew of somebody’s moms and dads out for a wild Ann Arbor night squeeze into the spots next to me. The tipsy star of their band immediately starts chatting me up. A woman “alone” at the comedy club &#8212; of course I desire his doting attentions! He entertains, he reads my Facebook phone updates over my shoulder. His wife and friends cheer him on for he’s so funny he should clearly be on stage!  Oh, a laugh riot this guy.  He wants to know is Maria anything like Paula Poundstone?  He likes Paula Poundstone.</p>
<p>Way to know a contemporary female comedian, buddy.  I quietly seethe.</p>
<p>“Nooo, she’s not really your typical stand-up.  She plays a lot with voice work. . .”</p>
<p>“OH, so she does voices.  Can she do Cher?  Sylvester Stallone?”</p>
<p>“No.  Um, she’s not really an impressionist.  She uses the voices to. . .”</p>
<p>“Does she do Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Oh, all right, voices! “</p>
<p>“. . . . . . .”</p>
<p>He went on to showcase his devastating display of comedy knowledge referencing everyone from Sam Kinison to. . . well, Paula Poundstone again.  I went on to call him stupid on Twitter and then concocted elaborate anxiety fantasies of him heckling Bamford, me sitting next to him mouthing to her, “I’m so sorry!”  My stomach at this point was well on its way to cat-o-nine-tails.</p>
<p>The first act was a boring newcomer full of expected and borderline offensive jokes that the old kids sure enjoyed.  Second up was Jackie Kashian &#8212; a friend of Maria’s and strong comedian.  Her work was more story-oriented and built around the ridiculousness of her family, and tales of her nerdish childhood.  Kashian’s style is confident, unshakeably so without being arrogant.  A fine line to walk but she walked it well and all while sporting her Powell’s Books t-shirt.  I liked her.  Dr. Comedy next to me was less pleased but still riding his buzz.</p>
<p>Finally, Maria came on and she was all that I hoped she’d be and more.  The packed closeness that had inspired claustrophobia was now cushioned by loud shared laughter.  The sticky crampedness that built stomach knots gave way into release.  Maybe this layout is part of the build up &#8212; it provides some of the necessary tension that jokes erupt out of, I pondered.  But Maria brought some of this discomfort too.  Her voice could be too quiet, I strained to hear, she babbled her weird thoughts, she’d close her eyes rehearsing what she had told us and what she had yet to say.  One could possibly think she looked unstable or at least fearful, uncomfortable on stage.  There was something true about this but also something that was just part of her performance. I knew she possessed the wherewithal to clean this up, look more “normal” if she wanted to, but she was choosing to show this process as it was.  She does not glibly glide from joke to joke, she gets there messily, truthfully.</p>
<p>But beyond this, I can’t really do her justice as her show relies so heavily on voice and intonation.  For a taste of her sense of humor here’s a story/joke she relayed about a conversation she and her new neighbor shared:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Maria’s new neighbor:</strong> I hope you don’t mind living next to a Mexican &#8212; you know we leave stuff on our lawn.</p>
<p><strong>Maria:</strong> I hope you don’t mind living next to a white lady, because I’m gonna steal that stuff.</p>
<p>MANIFEST DESTINY!  It <em>feels</em> like it’s mine!</p></blockquote>
<p>Old Kinison to my left did not approve.  He was sorry he didn’t get a chance to tell her to her face how badly she sucked.</p>
<p>Erin’s high-pitched laugh squealed behind me. I laughed tearfully.  Maybe she didn’t please everyone that night, but she sure punched some of us right in the comedy gut.</p>
<p>Now, for a comedian to be successful, assuming successful means garnering a wide audience, playing huge theaters, arenas, even, their material needs to hit a sweet spot of broad experience.  It has to fit into, explain and reflect the thoughts, dreams and fears of a good many people.  We tend to mark “the best” by measuring success in this fashion. However, there’s something special about artists like Bamford, performers who refuse to play to the standard and reach every person.  There’s something brave, kinda punk, kinda D.Y.I., feminist awesome about how incredibly close she keeps her comedy.  Her stories all spin out from her unique self and even when she ventriloquizes and lampoons those around her, she maintains the oddity and complexity of her own voice and perspective.  Her show was small, intimate, a little too close and that’s exactly where she’s at home and I felt at home there, too.  She might be too unsettling for even my weird friends, she might not be the next comedy sweetheart to sweep the nation, but she’s honest and amazing in her own right.  She might not steal your heart, but she may steal your stuff. . . and then tell a small crowd a very good story about it.</p>

The story must relate to the theme of that night, have a beginning, middle and end, and be told in five minutes.  Teams of judges are chosen from the audience and the storyteller awarded the most points wins.  This goes on monthly for a year and Slam winners then compete in the GrandSlam.</p>
<p>A wonderful, generous friend of mine donated to WDET, which sponsors the Slam, and was given VIP seats for a year. VIP seats are important when Cliff Bell’s gets filled to fire-safety-regulated capacity every Slam night.  My friend invited me to go to this month’s March Slam and I took her up on it with enthusiasm. If you don’t hold VIP seats you best get down to CB’s early if you don’t want to stand the whole night.  The Slam starts at seven-thirty, we were there by five, and it was already crowded to standing room only.</p>
<p>The theme for March was animals.  I love animals.  I like talking about animals.  I have a few stories about them.  My friend finds these stories amusing and encouraged me to put my name in the hat.  So I did.</p>
<p>I used to do theater in high school.  I very much enjoy karaoke.  I’m not scared of crowds.  There’s always a bit of an adrenaline rush, but other than that I can get up, do my thing and feel pretty okay with it, performance quality aside.</p>
<p>I didn’t think it would happen, but crazily, my name got picked out of the hat.  My friend was excited for me, and I was suddenly struck with a mild panic.</p>
<p>You see, the stories aren’t supposed to be rehearsed, but they announce the theme a month in advance.  People have plenty of time to come up with a story and/or decide if they want to spend an evening listening to stories on that theme.  I had a funny story in my mind organized into a beginning, middle and end that I practiced a couple times just to figure out the timing.  They blow a whistle every minute you go over the allotted time and I wanted to be sure I could practice proper etiquette.</p>
<p>So my name got picked.  I got up.  I was blinded by spotlights and immediately went into my story.  It was about monkeys being too violent and sexy for children at the zoo.  The thing was, in my mild panic I inadvertently abandoned my plan.  My mouth went on automatic and it told the animal stories I meant to tell, but without a beginning, middle and end.  I can’t remember hearing laughter or not.</p>
<p>Another important thing about the Story Slam: It’s for stories, not stand-up.  They don’t want you going up there and telling a bunch of jokes.  There are comedy clubs for that. However, it would seem my default setting for public storytelling is to tell it a bit like stand-up routine, only not quite as funny as real comic.</p>
<p>When I was done I went back to my seat, not entirely satisfied with the way I told my story, but happy I had the experience.</p>
<p>Then it was time for the judges to sound off.  I had, somehow, completely forgotten about the scoring part of the slam.  I was the third person to go up and received the lowest score up to that point.  I was there to have fun and hear hysterical stories, but I will admit there was a part of me that hoped someone else would get a lower score by the end of the Slam.  No such luck.  I stayed at the bottom the rest of the night.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people in that place, and I like to think there were at least a few people who found my tales of the murderous mandrill, sexy bonobos and a masturbating chimpanzee mildly entertaining.  In fact, a lady came up to me during intermission to tell me she thought I was robbed, that she really liked my story.  The thing was, thinking back over how I ended up telling it, I wasn’t that happy with it.  I had a better way of telling that story.  I suddenly thought of other stories I could have told better.  My tale didn’t have a beginning, middle and end, and it had the air of stand-up about it, which is probably why it scored so low.  Another possible disadvantage is that, being one of the first few people up there, the judges weren’t as drunk as they could/might have been/probably were by the second half, but thems the breaks.</p>
<p>It was still an amazingly fun time.  The other nine stories were all entertaining and the experience was one I will always remember.  Still, I’d like to have just one more crack at it. </p>
