										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday’s episode of <em>Mad Men</em>, “The Crash,” was packed with break ups, break ins, and breakdowns. Framed by the volatile relationship between the ad company and the Chevy account, the episode examines how things fall apart, both in and out of the office, through the tropes of collision, danger, safety and care. Herky-jerky and oddly paced, “The Crash” quite purposefully suffers from an irregular heartbeat that drives the viewer quickly forward, while also maintaining an unsettling sense of disquiet on the verge of nausea. We’re meant to feel feverish, sick. We’re meant to follow the fall of Don Draper and vicariously experience the thrill and horror of that flight/fall.</p>
<p>The office (newly merged with a business rival), Don (desperate to win Sylvia back), and the country (steadily losing troops in Vietnam) are all slipping and sliding, trying to stand on shaky ground. Beginning with a bang, the show opens with a scene of reckless driving and an automobile crash. Ken Cosgrove fearfully tries to control the wheel but the raucously drunk Chevy clients laugh and swat at him, brandish a gun, cover his eyes. The men question his masculinity because he won’t speed up, and eventually they overpower him, coaxing the car head-on into danger. When we next see Ken he’s injured and hobbling on crutches. He seeks sympathy but his co-workers don’t seem to care. </p>
<p>There’s a ton going on in this episode, but I was most interested in the issues of health and sickness and what it means to be a man. The show’s made an icon of Don Draper &#8212; he’s heralded as a mysterious lothario, a sixties “pimp,” and people, men, seem to find him admirable for this. Yet, lately, he’s off his game. His moments of Draper ad magic are coming with less frequency, less pop, and his love-’em-and-leave-’em sex magic seems pretty dried up, too, since he’s become needy, even frightening, in his desire for Sylvia. “The Crash” could be read as his coming down from a Sylvia high &#8212; the doctor’s wife acting as his anodyne, his distracting drug. Though we’ve seen Draper use sex as medicine before, something is different about this particular relationship. He places a much higher value on her, spins out of control, is lost and manic when she shuts her door to him. </p>
<p>Speaking of panaceas, things get uber weird when the company higher-ups call in a doctor to basically administer speed to the employees. Injected with a performance enhancing serum (business-man boner pills, anyone?), the copywriters are to gain focus, clarity, energy with one little shot. It seems only men take the drug and almost immediately foot races, and games of strength and fortitude fill the space. With the men turned little boys, the workplace is boiled down to its essence &#8212; &#8220;I can do it better, run faster, pee farther, than the next guy.&#8221; The serum causes quite the frenzied production, not to mention pretty serious side effects and hallucinations, but nothing that could actually count as usable, viable, ideas. </p>
<p>However, it is striking that the serum (and perhaps being on the brink of exhaustion) frees up emotional expression for the Mad Men. After the drug is administered, the fellas ask each other, “can you feel anything?” Though in reference to the serum taking effect, the question hangs starkly in the air. Do they feel? When and how? In the temporary “insanity” of sorts that follows, Don pleads with Sylvia on the phone shouting, “I’m feeling a lot of emotions!” Ken performs a bizarre yet marvelous soft shoe whilst expressing pent up hatred for his job, and Stan reaches out to Peggy seeking sex as succor for emotional wounds. Where this magical medicine is supposed to “fix” these men by creating efficient capitalist output, the episode uses the trip to explore much realer pains and ailments that expectations of masculinity won’t allow them to properly address. Why does my heart hurt? How and why do I work in an abusive environment? How do I grieve?</p>
<p>Don’s pain, of course, is central. For Draper, “The Crash” is about collisions within himself. Physical and mental smash together as his emotional detritus takes on somatic shape. After a particularly painful discussion with Sylvia, he collapses into a guttural cough that at some moments is indiscernible from sobbing &#8212; for this high power male exec, his sadness is his sickness. The cough threads us back to his past as Dick Whitman sick with a severe chest cold. His mother, rather than caring for the boy with hot chicken soup (the stuff that ads are made of) banishes him to the basement so as not to infect the others in the whorehouse with Dick’s supposed consumption. Layered with this painful lack of care is an even more twisted knot of memories. A whore takes him into her room, watches over him, nurses him to health, and then uses her power, age, and experience to take Dick’s virginity in what appears to be an abusive act. Yes, this could seem a cop-out backstory for a flawed character, but I don’t think it excuses his behavior, so much as gives it some context. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, Don Draper could hone the sadness of his past into the shiny, nostalgic, artifice of his work, his ads genius feats of psychological alchemy. In this episode, his feelings and history are overburdening the work. In his frenzied state he confuses work and home life in an unproductive and depressing manner. He spends all his time building an ad for himself, crafting the perfect spiel that will sell Don Draper, will get a foot back into Sylvia’s door. But, he’s also selling something to himself, the narrative that this woman is the key, the mother and lover that he’s always wanted but never had. Hopefully, the viewer discomfort churned up in episodes like this one will allow the audience to rethink Draper’s smoothness and make him a more nuanced character in a complex gender structure. One in which our performances as men and women are constantly negotiating power, expression, and perception. </p>
<p>All the edges of the episode suggest that there is no safety, people lie, there’s no one we can trust. Where early <em>Mad Men</em> revelled in the intoxicating allure of embellishment, this season is dipping into the emptiness and horror that can structure a lie. Peggy, though she harbors an avoidant past of her own, suggests that we have to let ourselves feel painful emotions, that we can’t “dampen [them] with drugs and sex,” but as one can imagine, this advice is not very popular. “The Crash” undoubtedly presents a male desire for care and comfort (coded as feminine) along with freedom from typical masculine roles, but sadly it suggests that truthfully engaging with such desires is a temporary madness that the right ad, right soup, right fuck can cure. It gives a compelling interpretation of the world of men then and now, tender, lost boys in beards and button up shirts, white-knuckling the wheel, holding on for dear life while secretly wishing to be in the passenger seat. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know Claire Huxtable and Roseanne Conner are pretty fantastic big mamas of the small screen, but who will make my list of dream moms?</p>
<p><strong>Linda Belcher of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em></strong></p>
<p>If I could only pick one TV mama to be my very own, it would have to be Linda Belcher. With big flippy hair, a penchant for sing-narrating everything she’s thinking, and a flair for the dramatic, this burger joint matriarch could very well be my genetic mother (I might be part cartoon). Linda is fantastic and refreshing because she’s so dorkily proud of her kids even and especially when they are doing or saying what others would deem troubling or strange. Tina’s writing erotic fiction about her peers? Linda excitedly responds to the “artsy fartsy” creativity of this hobby exclaiming, “Freaky friend fiction, all right!” When her attempt at producing dinner theatre in the restaurant is poorly reviewed &#8212; the set looks like children made it &#8212; rather than taking a negative critique negatively, she’s bursting with pride. It was made by children! Her children! </p>
<p>Ms. Belcher is a cool, kooky, sweet, funny mom who loves everything her kids make and do. A bastion of support, jokes, and cuddles, she can be a little over-the-top motherly, but ultimately I admire that she’s so incredibly hard to disappoint. She showers her family of weirdies with respect and accolades that ring perfectly silly and genuine and she does so without asking them to be better. Instead, she can be counted on to accept them and celebrate them as they are. Now, that’s all kinds of  “all right!”</p>
<p>Here’s Linda kissing her porcelain collection of babies. Imagine what she’s like with her real kids!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ns9Mbsr3gUQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Lorelai Gilmore of <em>Gilmore Girls</em></strong></p>
<p>Now, I avoided <em>Gilmore Girls</em> like the plague for a long while when it was on the air. It looked like a sappy, stupid mother-daughter fantasy land where mom and kid are best pals who share all their secrets over root beer and pizza. Well, yeah. Okay, Stars Hollow is pretty much a fantasy place and the Lorelais are definitely fantasy women, but once you get past all your cynical Sally stuff (How can they eat junk all the time and never gain weight? How can they watch all the TV and movies and still have time to read <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em>? How could a real mom be that awesome?) you fall in love with the fantasy. </p>
<p>When Lorelai is being a “drag” of a parent it’s often because she’s pushing Rory to be more daring &#8212; wear a two piece bathing suit, sneak out of the house. Mama Gilmore does anything and everything to provide for her girl; she supplies Lorelai Junior with all the books, warmth, junk food, and cable channels that a growing woman needs. With a ton of femme knowledge that far surpasses regular mom tricks like “smudge some lipstick on your cheekies!,” Lorelai has all the fashion know-how to make a blah cardigan look like a fetching, but not trying too hard, signature piece. When it comes down to it, L.G. is just your typical total knockout, monied teen mom, who leaves the lap of luxury to live life by her own standards and provide for her daughter in the quaintest most pop culturally saturated existence possible. She knows everything from Muppets to Monet, the Go-Gos to <em>Grey Gardens</em>, and just about any of her spit-fire dialogue is incredibly quotable. I’m not ashamed to say it (anymore), I’d love to be a Gilmore Girl. </p>
<p>Lorelai on motherhood.</p>

<p><strong>Sophia Petrillo of <em>The Golden Girls</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve been watching and LOVING <em>The Golden Girls</em> since I was a kid. So, maybe I didn’t get why Rose accidentally buying extra large condoms (and then the grocery guy announcing it for a price check) was hilarious, but everything else translated well, and I’m pretty sure I get that condom joke, now, thank you very much. Even as a girl, I identified with Dorothy (do with that what you will) but you wouldn’t need to be a Dortothy to love her mom, Sophia, and envy their awesomely sarcastic and loving relationship. </p>
<p>Sophia is the perfect little old lady. That grandma shuffle? That wicker bag? A great listener, an old school classic storyteller (“Picture it &#8212; Sicily&#8230;), and the comedic timing and blunt brashness of Don Rickles. Sassy, sexy, and fun, this lil’ mama is just as comfortable volunteering caring for sickies at the hospital as painting the town red with Mr. Burt Reynolds. She’s the kind of mom who you’d actually want to shack up with you and your best buds, and she’s the kind of mom who will continue to love her “pussycat” daughter with all her wicked little Italian heart. . . even if that daughter has sent her to “the home” at least once before. That’s amore!</p>
<p>A favorite Sophia and Dorothy moment. Why isn’t this MY life?!</p>

<p><strong>Lucille Bluth of <em>Arrested Development</em></strong> </p>
<p>Her? Really? Her? Well, no. I don’t want her to be my mom, but I think she’s really funny. She’s all yours, Baby Buster.</p>
<p>“I don’t care for Gob.”  </p>

<p>Mama’s cuttin’ loose!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always loved watching TV. Yes, I said loved. I watch far too much and I blame my mother for that. She limited my TV watching when I was a kid. For a while growing up we didn’t even have a TV. (My babysitters were very bored after I went to bed.) I never watched <em>Sesame Street</em> or <em>Fraggle Rock</em>. At my father’s house the television screen was six inches. It wasn’t even a color TV. The only thing I remember watching on it was <em>Star Trek</em>. Once I got into middle school and high school I watched a bit more, but my mom was still there trying to curb my TV time. I would watch TV standing up with my hand on the cable box, ready to hit the power button and scurry off to start my chores the second I heard her car pull in the driveway. Obviously I had to make up for this lack of screen time in my childhood by watching an obscene amount of television (and movies on TV) once I hit adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite my devotion to television &#8212; you should see my cable bill &#8212; I still love books more. Lately I’ve been trying to figure out why. I think a big part of it is the freedom reading a book gives you. I don’t mean you can travel to new places or whatever the libraries of America try to convince you books can do. I mean that when I read a book I can picture the story unfolding in my head. And just because the author gives a main character blue eyes and fair skin doesn’t mean that’s how he looks to me. I can shorten him a little below the towering height a writer describes. I can ditch the blue eyes and give him brown ones like the boy I had a crush on in grade school. I can picture his smile and his mannerisms. With a movie you get what the casting director wants you to see.</p>
<p>With a book you can slow down and savor well-written passages. You can be surprised that an object mentioned in chapter one has a great deal of importance in the final pages because there wasn’t a slow dramatic camera pan to it. You can create your version of the world the author created.</p>
<p>This is not to say movies are bad or of lower quality than books. They&#8217;re an entirely different art form. And I do enjoy watching movies based on books I’ve enjoyed. To stop myself from fussing about all the differences I try to see the movie as a detailed summary of the book. Minor characters are often lost, plot points are condensed, motivations aren’t always fully explained. There’s nothing wrong with this, it’s just what makes the book better. I will always cry harder when a character dies in the book than in the movie.</p>
<p>Sometimes filmmakers try to capture the entire book. <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> was made into two movies. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> movies are all over three hours long. George R. R. Martin’s books are a television series on HBO and they still have to skip small details. I know making a book into a film can do wonders for the sales of that book. Finding out a movie I liked is a book often encourages me to read the book. What author wouldn’t love the boost in sales? </p>
<p>The notable exception to this rule is <em>American Psycho</em> (2000). The movie is fantastic, one of my favorites. A few years ago my husband bought the book, assuming that because he liked the movie so much he would enjoy it. I’ve been encouraging him to read more fiction so I proposed that we both read it for a little husband/wife book group. Neither of us made it past 60 pages. It’s awful. Obviously this is just my opinion, but I was shocked at the difference. I know one of the themes is consumerism and the movie touches that nicely. The book hits you over the head. I got tired of reading brand names somewhere around page five. It’s like half the text. And I felt like nothing was happening, the action was too slow, the characters too dull. </p>
<p>I wondered how this could be. Was I missing something? Was the novel better than the first read? I did a little investigating and I learned that Bret Easton Ellis, the author, wants to do a remake of the movie. Then I learned that Bret Easton Ellis is an idiot. He wants a shallow, rich, useless reality star to play Patrick Bateman, a role played impeccably by actor Christian Bale. First of all a remake would do nothing for this movie. <em>Total Recall</em> was remade with a different take on the story; <em>Star Trek</em> was set in an alternate reality. <em>American Psycho</em> was perfection in its first iteration; it needs no reboot. And you don’t need an insipid rich douche in real life to play one on the big screen. That’s the whole reason acting exists. A good actor can play a psychopath without actually being one. It’s actually amazing that Ellis didn’t ruin the movie. He didn’t write the screenplay and it shows. The director saw something in that book of his and polished it until it shown. </p>
<p>I’ve never fully understood that “exception proving the rule” phrase, but I think this nails it. Books and movies are each good in their own way and when they come together in capable hands magic can happen. I think it’s more often the case that a movie does a book a disservice – <em>The Golden Compass</em> movie was a wreck – than the other way around. Both are creative endeavors I will continue to enjoy, I’ll just always enjoys books a little more. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written before about <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/14/treat-yoself-to-parks-and-rec/">how much I love <em>Parks and Recreation</em></a> &#8212; the characters, the writing &#8212; but I haven’t been too happy with this season’s trajectory. Though I am pleased with the progression of Chris Traeger’s character and the manner in which his obsessive traits have been seriously examined, the current portrayal of Leslie Knope feels both incredibly off and off-putting. The shift in Chris was unexpected. The writers could easily have kept milking his trademark perfectionism without question &#8212; his extreme fitness and nutrition practices acting merely as reminders that Chris is “that guy,” a strange, yet colorful, weirdo in this merry band of weirdos. But, instead Parks opted for depth. Lately, we’ve seen Chris’ fears laid bare and more overtly witnessed his “quirks” explained as excessive and possibly even disordered behavior. This choice is pretty brave and refreshing &#8212; to show a man who seems perfect, if grossly on top of things, and unpack that perfection as an unhealthy desire for control manifested through unhealthy treatment of his body. Pretty progressive and neat. Parks is usually pretty thoughtful like that. </p>
<p>But then there’s this issue with Leslie. Ever since Leslie got engaged to geeky pocket cutie Ben, things have been weird, y’all. The wedding, per sitcom norm, has taken up a lot of story time and space. On one level that makes me sad because it’s so cliché. Weddings, babies, the addition of a dog, or a cousin Oliver, all seem to mark the death of a show as we once knew it. There’s a sense that when these narratives pop up that maybe the show has run out of steam. I know that in terms of storytelling, this situation can be more complex. Perhaps romances, babies, dogs, and long lost cousins are parts of important stories and that’s why we see them cycled through so often on the television, but I for one, think that there also must be so much more unexplored TV territory and I was hoping my favorite show would go there, courageously and hilariously. </p>
<p>Personally, I’m not all that interested in Ben and Leslie’s romance. I like Ben. I’m glad she found a cool guy, but I’m definitely not gushing over their nuptials. The latest episodes have been particularly uncomfortable to me because they show Leslie barely capable of containing her love for Ben. We learn that getting married to her cute-butted, elflike lover is her dream come true. Spoiler alert, the couple even ties the knot 3 months early because she just can’t wait any longer to be his wife. Um, what? Again, I’m glad that Leslie’s in love or whatever, but when has marriage ever been a top priority for Ms. Knope? The Leslie I know has always wanted to be a strong, fair, and caring woman, an important politician who works for the people of her beloved town, if not the entire nation. Leslie’s dream come true, to me, would look something like President Knope (and maybe first gentleman Joe Biden) raising mini horses on the White House lawn. The Biden husband would be a nice extra, but the presidency and the mini horses would be a must. </p>
<p>So for Parks to get all sweet and saccharine on me, celebrating wuv, twoo wuv, and beyond that painting Leslie as so intensely eager for a typical marital union, without considering the political ramifications of what that union might mean. . . well, it’s a little shocking and disappointing. I know it’s not like we found out that Leslie is a serial killer or she secretly hates puppies, but this move just doesn’t match the tone or consistency of the show and character that I love.</p>
<p>Will marriage end up being more of a struggle now that the fun, pretty, and sugar-coated part is over? (The bachelor party episode did indeed remind us that almost every male character is divorced, after all). Will the old Leslie’s passion for politics return as though no sitcom narrative cliché ever occured? Or will this strange feminist show I love jump the Pawnee shark (raccoon?) and become a more typical network show? Time will tell, I guess.</p>
<p>Instead of titillating my inner romantic, Leslie and Ben making it official has left me mourning stories where it’s okay for women to want different things, want more, want something beyond or outside marriage. I’m left wishing the Hillary Clinton of the hilarious memes could send my gal Leslie a text, cuz, Giiiirrrrl, something’s up with your game. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em> was a big deal for Louis C.K. Sure, anyone who hosts at least seems to realize the import of their insertion soundly into popular culture through this practice, but I still imagine this experience was a little more stirring for someone like Louis. Unlike a trendy young starlet, quirky pro athlete, or multi-talented musician, C.K. is a comedian; when he walks into Studio H8 he’s entering the hallowed halls of the comedians that came before him. There’s a precedent. There’s history. There’s awe. At the New York Public Library’s memorial for George Carlin, C.K. remembers his first aware, intense, and moving fit of laughter as brought forth by Carlin on <em>SNL</em>. <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/george-carlin-monologue-2/268365/" target="_blank">“What do dogs do on their day off? They can’t lie around &#8212; that’s their job&#8230;”</a> In relating this story of a joyful first, he makes a personal connection to that man and that show, through laughter, as the point in which he knew he wanted to be a comedian. This link to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> alone is huge, then add on top of that the disastrous effects of Sandy on New York and boy does the ante get upped. </p>
<p>In an email to his fans, Louis writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness. It can&#8217;t even be called a trip through time, because as long as new york has lived, its been lit. By electricity, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene. But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, to walk through the heart of it and feel like, in a way, it was dead. I can&#8217;t tell you how that felt.</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on in his letter to relate that when he walks on for his monologue he’ll be thinking about the people of New York, the people from <em>SNL</em> who worked so hard to put together a show amidst chaos, and his place as a comedian and New Yorker in relation to these various communities of public and fans. A huge C.K. fan myself, I must say I was incredibly moved by his writing to us in his alone moments before the show started. I could picture him nervous, a little sweaty, and gracious. This is the comedian I love. </p>
<p>On a personal level, it also meant a lot to me that he did his monologue old school, and in typical comedian-style, he just performed some stuff from his most recent shows &#8212; material I was lucky enough to hear at the Masonic Temple in Detroit in early October. Not only did he share work I’d heard live, but he shared my favorite story. </p>
<p>The story entails Louis making his way through the airport and this little old lady falls down. Inveterate misanthrope that he is, he pantomimes watching the lady tumble as he looks appropriately shocked, but clearly hopes someone else will help her. Well, no one does. The onus falls on our anti-hero and he’s like, “great, now I have an old lady.” He ends up schlepping this ancient broad and her bags and her onion paper travel documents through the busy airport. Many jokes are cracked at her expense. Poor put-upon Louis! He just wants to be anti-social and this happens to him! And the extended story culminates with C.K. sitting and talking with the woman all day and he finishes his telling in a bratty rushed/hushed and disinterested manner with, “and it was so beautiful to meet her, and she changed my life or whatever, *eyeroll*.”  </p>
<p>I like this joke because it has heart. It’s not super mushy sweetness, in fact it’s mostly girded by Louis’ discomfort with people, especially people who are different from him (old, from another country, or at least culture), and his unease when circumstances push him into intimate moments with this other. It’s truthful, it’s personal, it’s not the kind of joke you’ve heard over and over. It explores everyday life and emotion closely and carefully and ultimately it peels back superficial layers of stalwart masculinity and the coldness of the modern urban citizen and finds more. It opens up a space for Louis and for men and for people in general to understand themselves beyond the labels that keep us safe and comfortable. This is exactly the kind of revelatory work I love to see Louis do.  </p>
<p>It was important to me to watch C.K. pluck this piece, from a show of really strong and probably more easily digestible material, for this super important spotlight moment because it showed me that C.K. is still interested in what’s difficult, what’s hard and what’s weird and that he’s going to keep growing. His most recent show was great, really strong, up there with some of the best comedians in terms of laughability, pacing, content, but there’s a “But.” As good as it was, it felt a little bland, a little vanilla. . . from Louis. From anyone else, just fine, but from Louis I expect more. More darkness, more anger, more gurgling pit of stomach, kid hating, shameful, edgy moments, or at least risk, vulnerability. Instead there was a bit of ease. Is it because he’s getting older? Is he running out of ideas? Or is the Louis of old gone now that he’s incredibly renowned and Emmy-winning, <em>SNL</em>-hosting, famous? I think Ricky Gervais hits it on the nose when he pinpoints Louis’ precise draw as, “this is a man falling apart for my pleasure!” What’s left when our man is fairly put together? </p>
<p>The show I witnessed was about men and women (Louis’ getting “a lot of pussy,” or going on a lot of “nice dates” depending on which of his friends you talk to), how awesome boobs feel, and how young thin white guys are the worst and pretty much get whatever they want while the rest of us are fucked, and not in the fun way. There were some strong humorous hypotheticals &#8212; what if it were legal for everyone to kill just one person? And there was a pretty great story about C.K. moving on up to a fancier apartment community and how one of the richies came over to question his presence on the property. This allowed us some moments of that gruff C.K. we know, he’s angry and he’s just hoping this asshat comes over and tells him something, tries to kick him out. The audience digs in and thrills at the thought. . . ooooh, it’s gonna be good when Louis gets pissed! And he does! And it’s awesome, but then the disclaimer: none of this actually happened. The dude came up and said hi to Louis like he belonged there. Good story and all, but I think it also highlights his easier life and further separates us from him. Louis was the guy who was always getting shit on and we could commiserate with that, now he’s the guy in tuxedos, on the TV, in the fancy apartment. His fantasy of not belonging makes a lot of sense as a way of clinging to who he was and feeling a little unsure of how to deal with who he’s becoming. </p>
<p>I was starting to think maybe this was the case. Maybe Louis is fattening up on the good life and leaving me and all the other lonely ones behind with all our weirdness. I comforted myself with the idea that maybe his absurdist show provides him enough of an outlet for mining the abject and that leaves his stand-up room to take on a new shape (which is fine, even if it’s not as challenging or interesting to me). But then, he went on <em>SNL</em> and he didn’t talk about boobs, or dating, or dudes, or wanting to kill people. He talked about little old ladies, and that made me think that maybe everything with me and Louis is going to be all right. And by all right I mean strange, uncomfortable, and difficult ever after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It probably says a lot about me that the first show I ever recorded with a DVR was ALF. No, not some new reboot. The <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JDUBE2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JDUBE2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank">original show from the 1980s</a>. Yes, I now have access to a state of the art TV recording device, and I use it to record sitcom reruns.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>Like most who share my 31 years, I grew up watching ALF. I remember watching reruns after school as a kid. This might explain how I developed my own smart-mouth sarcastic humor (and perhaps, my fondness for cats). As a kid, the show&#8217;s draw was it had a puppet. But, as an adult, I get much, much more of the humor and enjoy its brilliant absurdity.</p>
<p>OK, and I still like that it has a puppet.</p>
<p>I watched a favorite episode the other day &#8212; where the Tanners throw a Halloween party, and ALF shows up with a zipper taped to his chest to pass off as a guest (<a href="http://alf.wikia.com/wiki/Some_Enchanted_Evening" target="_blank">“Some Enchanted Evening”</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still laughing about it. Yes, it was a cheesy, simple gag, but I loved it. The visual is hilarious on two levels &#8212; the zipper looks totally out of place, and ALF interacting with a room full of adults, instead of just the Tanners, really puts the focus on his shortness.</p>
<p>Ah, <em>sitcoms</em>.</p>
<p>The episode also has one of my favorite comedic reversals. I&#8217;m paraphrasing here, but it goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Willie: Where did you get that zipper?</p>
<p>ALF: You know that old jacket you&#8217;ve been meaning to throw out?</p>
<p>Willie: Yeah.</p>
<p>ALF: Well, you might wanna hang on to it. I ripped this out of your new raincoat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! Classic.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care much for sitcoms these days, but I will always watch ALF when I can. Maybe it is the connection to my youth, or maybe it is the humor.</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, I like smart-mouth puppets.</p>

On October 31st, I get to try on another skin (usually not in Leatherface style) and I get to try on another life.  It’s the day when we can flaunt all our baser instincts on the outside and everyone agrees to read this as merely part of a traditional running gag.  We pretend that a grown man dressed as a robot is simply kitsch, that my Kim Kardashian Klubwear (replete with faux bootyliciousness) is ironic and has nothing to do with a desire to be like her.  We pretend, but deep down we know who are and that our disguises may actually speak more truths than the mundane “costumes” we wear to work every day.</p>
<p>Cut to a place where the everyday norm is monstrous and strange while it’s Halloween that tends to feel tired, a little ho-hum.  Welcome to Sunnydale, California, a.k.a. Hellmouth, U.S.A.  Yes.  We’re going there.  Buffy territory, ya’ll.  Love it or leave it. And you better love it.</p>
<p>Now, during this blessed time of year, I urge you to go back to Buffy and her Scooby gang (or visit with her for the first time, if you dare) because this show really captures the silly/crazy/ugly/funny monstrosity of being human.  Starting with cheesier, dorkier episodes, the show grows with its cast and audience answering life’s questions from: “why must I be a teen werewolf in love?” to “how do I come out to my mom as a ‘kinda gay’ witch?” to “what is my greatest gift and how do I share it with the world while protecting mankind from total demonic destruction?”</p>

If you’re over high school shenanigans, try the college years.  The fashion hilarity alone is worth tracking, people.  How high up the torso can the Buffster’s khakis get?  How many lame-o terrycloth zipper-necked polos does Xander own?  Get in on these epic conversations!  </p>
<p><strong>Me</strong> (chanting): <em>One of us!  One of us!</em></p>
<p>And let me reiterate, if you love Halloween as much as I do, then <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> is a real treat.  The first Halloween episode cleverly plays out the psychological desires that linger inside one’s costume of choice by turning each character into the ghastly ghoulie or pretty princess they thought they were merely portraying. Chaotic hilarity ensues.  Each Halloween show is awesome, in my humble opinion, but like I mentioned above, in Sunnydale and in the Buffyverse by extension, everyday is pretty Halloweeny, so settle in and let the sugar rush take hold.</p>
<p>Not convinced?  Oh, but there are many reasons to (re)watch:</p>
<ol>
<li>You get to see a female hero (whoop, whoop!) cope with and learn to own her identity as slayer, savior, leader, daughter, sister and friend.</li>
<li>Teamwork abounds and each character is loveably flawed, quirky, angsty, hilarious and inevitably at some point, poorly dressed.</li>
<li>Even the villains and extras are freaking fantastic and they return throughout the series with realistic regularity so that you feel like you’re peeking in on a real universe full of real relationships.  There is no forgetting; the past is always part of the present and future of the show, which also makes for classic call-back catch phrases.</li>
<li>The monster metaphor speaks to the awkward, the outcasted and the queer&mdash;a part of all of us and the identity of many who don’t usually have the luxury of seeing their story on TV</li>
<li>Stemming from my first reason, issues of “girl power” intricately build into the furious glory of ultra feminism in the last season.  Legend-… (wait for it)…-dary.  Literally.  Like, whoa.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what say you we make Halloween last a little longer this year?  Carry the candy hangover well into Turkeyday (there’s a good episode about that, too) and invite good ole Spike and Drusilla over for a little cuddle and a wee bit of evil&mdash;How does that sound?  </p>
<p>Insane troll logic?  Well, that’s my favorite kind!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to this, the greatest of seasons, that wonderful time in which we are gifted new television shows from the networks, writers, and actors, I expect to take the good with the bad.  Pilots are pilots; they are rough and rusty little things, that are trying (often too hard) to get noticed when they aren’t even quite sure who they are yet, what their voice is, or where their soul lies. So, as exciting as it is to check out the newbies, I know that I have to watch for what’s working and forgive a lot of blahs that come with a new show’s desire to win a fickle and already overstimulated audience. I understand that there will be attempts to copy flimsy trends and well-worn formulas and that some of the greatest shows need time to develop. However, in this year’s lineup, I have to say then that I’m more than a little surprised to feel so immediately tapped into a program, especially as it’s one that I had harshly prejudged and pre-benched for bored-on-the-weekend viewing only. I gotta say, I’ve been loving NBC’s <em>Go On</em>, pilot and all.  </p>
<p><em>Go On</em> stars Matthew Perry as fancypants L.A. sportscaster, Ryan King, whose wife recently died in a car accident. Not dealing too well with the grieving process (he attacks a famous athlete for texting while driving, the very thing that killed his wife), he’s required to get some sessions in with a group that is likewise working through rough life transitions. Now, the group setting is where the show could slap together a rag-tag crew of oddballs and exploit their instability, or “craziness” for laughs, but <em>Go On</em> doesn’t do this. Instead, it’s the eccentrically loveable ensemble cast that is nicely carrying the show. The episodes are about how lonely it is to be “King,” yes, but it’s also about the group’s many brand’s of loneliness and how they find comfort in community. </p>
<p>The show finely rides the line of the stereotype though &#8212; there’s a cat lady, an angry lesbian, an old blind curmudgeon, an over-anxious Asian-American, a Latina woman who speaks mostly in Spanish, and a young African American kid who won’t open up. Beyond the exaggerated play on type (Fausta’s spanglish and references to Ryan as “Oh, Meester King!” for example), the camera clearly catches the depth of each person. Fausta could easily be simple, marginalized, but we see her sharp sense of humor and her pain at the loss of her family. Anne’s “angry lesbian” could be a throwaway schtick, but instead we’re pushed to understand where her anger comes from &#8212; her partner died because she didn’t take care of her health, and this to Anne is incredibly stupid and infuriating. Though the characterizations are subject to tokenization, the characters are three dimensional and the show’s early episodes suggest that their backstories will be complex, full, and emotional. Should they keep up the careful storytelling, the diversity of the cast will remain impressive. The support group along with Ryan’s work colleagues are all portrayed with nods toward their social context, but ultimately with dignity and normalcy, and that matters. These are not Asians and black people, weirdos or crazies, they are just people. People in messed up, funny/sad situations trying to make it and anyone could relate.  </p>
<p>Sans laughtrack, the show has more freedom to dip into despair, to follow the longing of a well-picked heartbreaking song and then poke out again into Perry’s sarcasm and silliness. I like that instead of painting King as a total bigshot the likes of Joel McHale’s character on Community, <em>Go On</em> presents him as incredibly charming, but given to his foibles. He may not think he needs the support group at first, but he doesn’t ever think he’s better than them. In fact, he has an exuberance for people that is quite endearing. Ryan tends to find a way to make therapy fun and active. Where Lauren, the group’s facilitator, is more well versed in psychological and behavioral theory and the delicate nature of emotions, Ryan is well suited to helping the group laugh, change, face fears, get out of the room and do. These different skill sets play with and against each other well and hint at the kind of issues and relationship concerns that both Lauren and Ryan and the entire group will face this season. And yes, it’s been picked up for a full season.  </p>
<p><em>Go On</em> isn’t blowing my mind or bringing me to tears, or fits of hilarity, but it’s good &#8212; really good. It depicts how and why we hurt and explores why it’s so difficult to talk about our pain, our loss, while also reminding us that this process can be full of ridiculous fears and failures, and funny ones to boot. Instead of building types of people&#8211;someone who has to overcome A, someone with issues with B &#8212; the program reveals unique personalities, ones that I want to continue getting to know. For a brand new, non-cable show, <em>Go On</em>’s come out of the gate strong and it’s invitation is tempting. I’m listening and watching&#8230; &#8220;Go on&#8230;&#8221; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrie Brownstein is rock and roll fun</p>
<p>Riot Grrl, band member of Sleater Kinney and Wild Flag, Carrie Brownstein is most recently famous for her work as a laugh-riot-girl on the ever quirky and strange IFC comedy series, <em>Portlandia</em>. Though this feminist chica is hot and awesome for both her talents and rockin’ ways, I’m also totally crushing on girlfriend’s wardrobe. Carrie Brownstein, you are a style icon!</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10571" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/19/style-icons-carrie-brownstein/carriewildflag/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg" data-orig-size="399,595" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="carriewildflag" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=201" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=399" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=201&#038;h=300" alt="onstage" title="carriewildflag" width="201" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10571" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=201&amp;h=300 201w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" /> Carrie’s style is basic, but hip. It’s relaxed and simple while quietly purring “rrrrrrawk.” There’s a tomboyish aspect to her uniform as she tends to live in jeans and shorts, but the cut and fit are everything. Her pants are always perfectly snug giving her a sleek sexy vibe even as she doesn’t show much skin. Her shorts, though they show off her great legs, often give off a cheeky appeal as she pairs them with tucked in, button-down shirts. These clean tailored outfits present a punked-up boy scout vibe and remind one a little of another musical school boy, AC/DC’s Angus Young. Brownstein’s shirts are either crisp, oxford style tops with short or rolled sleeves, or femme floaty blouses, perhaps with a little sheen or sheerness. When she sports the latter and throws on a sweet pair of speckled tights on under those shorties, the outfit becomes a magical amalgam of retro flirtatiousness and modern bad-assery. Now, granted, some of this comes with context. She’s up on stage, rollicking, strumming her guitar and singing her lungs out all while writhing to the music, flicking her head back and punctuating her performance with a high kick or two; this behavior paired with the sugary diaphanous tops is fashion balance to T. She soaks those dolly blouses in rocker sweat, shreds those tights like she does her guitar. Oh, and her rough and tumble, short-stack-heeled leather ankle booties &#8212; yeah, they’re, again, just the right mix of tough and cute. Work it out, head to toe, CB.  </p>
<p>Now, to make Brownstein’s style our own, as we are but mortals and not rock goddesses, we must up the ante a little in the accessory department. Grab all the basics, some grey, eggplant, or even lilac colored tight skinnies and your well-fitted buttoned and/or artsy-Portland-gal tops, but then add some studded earrings or a tough black leather cuff for more masculine umph. Miu Miu-inspired glitter boots are all the rage this season; find your knock-off pair and let your kicks bespeak your rock and roll lifestyle. Keep the look simple for ultimate chicness. Maybe let a structured, full coverage, pretty bra show through under your see-through shirt, but do remember to always temper the sex-pot of it all. Keep the hair messy bedhead in style and the makeup minimal &#8212; a swath of red on the pout if you feel like causing a ruckus. The Carrie look is cool and unassuming with a strut that’s willing and waiting to show itself. Put on some Wild Flag. Shake out your waves. Find your strut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Schumer’s first hour-long special, “Mostly Sex Stuff,” recently aired on Comedy Central. I’ve read some negative reviews claiming that she’s just another typical female comedian, oversexed, and too caught up in talking about dating, but I tend not to agree. One brilliant internet dude claims that we shouldn’t bother with Amy because if we’ve seen Chelsea Handler’s, Natasha Legerro’s, or Whitney Cumming’s acts we’ve seen Schumer’s. Because women are all the same. The fellas from the <em>Never Not a Nerd Show</em> explain that there are women who are funny socially or as writers, but as one nerd put it, “I’ve never seen stand-up from a woman that’s not “here’s me banging dudes. . .” and “being a girl is hard and vaginas are weird &#8212; that’s the other thing they [female stand-ups] have.” I’d like to go on the record with my own little review because men aren’t the only ones who can plaster their opinions all over the internet. And also because my opinions are better.</p>

Her persona is sharp as she playfully places a dark edge on her exaggerated and cutesy feminine mannerisms. Schumer’s style is all about inviting us into a familiarly gendered space and then exploding, or at least surprising, us out of it. She chats with her audience as though we are a gaggle of gal pals, and telling us about “mostly sex things” she takes us along on her adventures in dating, relationships, and more casual encounters.  Oozing with sarcasm she lulls everyone into the rhythm of the staid stereotypical (female) stand-up.  “Am I right, ladies?” she asks. When she gets a reaction from the crowd, “Thanks, sister-friends!”  But sandwiched in the “Ohmygawd, I’m a girl!” banter is a joke about being tested for AIDS, or how much of a boundary-blind cunt her mom is, or the time her boyfriend wanted to discuss the possibility of bringing assplay into their bedroom. I believe that last joke ended with her calling his bluff, his delicately placing one finger atop her anus, and her giving him the fisting of a lifetime. Yeah. And then she giggles, makes dolly eyes, and twirls her hair a bit.  I love it.  </p>
<p>Though her hour-long show sagged a bit in parts, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her observations, stories, or subject matter. Rather, it seems she has a unique rhythm and her strengths lie in her bracketed offbeats on the way to telling a larger joke. Let me explain what I mean, here. With the fisting joke, the punchline comes quite appropriately with the fisting, but she goes on to give some extra info &#8212; “He’s dead now.” That little line is so powerful. It’s unnecessary, but its excessiveness builds the enjoyment of the previous joke. Likewise, when she’s telling a tale about a man commenting on her “sturdy” build, she parenthetically adds, “He was from Texas. . . or some place I’m not going.”  These little extras, these bits of information that distract from the main focus, can add to the realistic feel of listening to a friend chatting while further playing up her critique of the “privileged white girl” character. </p>
<p>Though one could argue that this isn’t really new territory as one-liners were once the comedy norm, the way she weaves a number of tight and punchy one-liners into a larger set of more complex stories is impressive and really her own.  What she’s doing with her act is strong, but in an hour-long show all those fragments can create some weird beats and awkward pauses.  Yes, in this special not all of her transitions were exactly seamless, but as a young comic, she’s got plenty of time to perfect her timing and flow and work these issues out.  </p>
<p>If my critical breakdown of Schumer humor sucked the life out of all things comedic, perhaps I can sway you with some of the show’s high points that really worked and tickled my funny bone. </p>
<ul>
<li>On being a child and seeing her mom’s bushy pubic hair situation for the first time: &#8220;Is Mom being swarmed by BEES?&#8221;</li>
<li>On seeing an uncircumcised penis for the first time: (on phone) &#8220;Mom, can you come pick me up? . . . I don’t know &#8212; It’s wearing like a hat, or a cape. . . I don’t know!&#8221;</li>
<li>On using a toilet at a club after she assures us she’s not going to say anything gross: &#8220;So, there I was, just dropping a TON of heat. . . just massacring this bowl. . . I’m texting people, &#8216;Am I DYING?'&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>See?  She’s got the funny. She’s got the chops. She’s got boobs and vag and miraculously these body parts aren’t holding her back.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, the show is worth watching. If you know her work, you’ll see Schumer branching out a bit in places while also honing the voice she’s created. Sure, I’m excited to see her go a little deeper and lend more time to her discussions of class, race, feminism, and stand-up itself, but these things will come with time. I say, don’t listen to the internet guys who suggest you avoid her work for being too girly. (How quickly men forget how often we’ve patiently listened to their sex stories and their detailed depictions of their nether regions.) I say, nut up and imagine what it’s like to have an ovary for a second, fellas. What doesn’t kill you will make you stronger. . . and perhaps more highly educated, and worthier adversaries as fellow nerds.</p>
