										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not uncommon for my daughters to be up before me on weekend. They’re pretty good at entertaining themselves—sometimes quietly and sometimes not-so-much—while their parents try to steal a few more minutes of sleep. This Saturday, after she thought that she had waited long enough, my younger daughter, who I will refer to as Bootsy, came into the room and stood by my side of the bed. When I opened my eyes, she asked me, “Are you going to play the penguin today?”</p>

Complete with a cute little scarf. (I prefer to think of him as being more inspired by Opus than by Chilly Willy, but a bow tie wasn’t one of my choices.)</p>
<p>I don’t particularly like <em>Little Big Planet</em>. I’m not a big fan of platform games, which revolve around getting from point A to point B in a largely two-dimensional environment, and which reward reflexes and memorization above all else. I get bored quickly, and I almost always hit a very specific point where I get stuck, and the work involved in overcoming the obstacle is way more than I’m willing to invest in the game. In <em>Little Big Planet</em>, that point was in the second level in the Islands area. There’s a segment where your sackboy has to grab on to a series of spinning wheels, and basically throw one’s self up a tower. Mastering the sequence required many, many falls, and then you have to do the same thing again in a second area, this time, without a floor.</p>
<p>Yeah. Not so much.</p>
<p>But for all this, I’ve found myself playing <em>Little Big Planet</em> quite a bit lately. And trying to figure out why.</p>
<p>Part of the answer has something to do with the fact that not particularly liking something is nowhere near the same as hating it. <em>Little Big Planet</em> can be fun, and the user-designed levels give me something to do even if I&#8217;ve given up on the main &#8220;storyline.&#8221; Part of it is that many of the charms of <em>Little Big Planet</em>, at least for me, are similar to the charms of a game like <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/01/click-click-click-2/">Mafia Wars</a>. I can play it in short discrete sessions, and it gives me a wealth of little prizes to chase after, even if I&#8217;m no longer making progress toward some larger, overriding goal. (Given <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/23/final-fantasy-vii-again-for-the-first-time/">my current other gaming project</a>, being able to pick up a game and put it down again less than a hour later has a very real appeal.)</p>
<p>And part of the answer has to do with the face waiting for me to open my eyes on Saturday morning. It&#8217;s fun to play <em>Little Big Planet</em> because my daughters enjoy watching the game so much. <em>Little Big Planet</em> is a particularly kid-friendly game, cute, fun to look at, and not too scary, but I&#8217;m not sure that the girls care about any of that. It&#8217;s simply one of the two games I own (along with <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/22/693/">Katamari Forever</a>) that I&#8217;m willing to play in front of them. And the girls love video games. Any video game. Rabbit (the daughter who isn&#8217;t Bootsy) is a horse fanatic, and I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d love <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, but even if I avoid the storyline missions, I can&#8217;t be sure that any random person I encounter won&#8217;t swear at me. Or be trying to kill a prostitute. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready to explain that one.</p>
<p>Bootsy gets really upset when I lose a character in <em>Little Big Planet</em>, but he always pops out, good as new. It&#8217;s really comforting to be able to tell her that she doesn&#8217;t have to be afraid, that it&#8217;s okay, and for it to actually be okay. We have to lie about that kind of thing to our kids enough. So I relish my moment of honesty. And I play again.</p>
