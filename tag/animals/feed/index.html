										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first met Darius as he careened past me in a doorway, attempting to dart down the stairs behind us. It was a bit of a shock, frankly. This was my first visit to a no-kill animal shelter, and wasn’t quite prepared for how overwhelming the experience would be. I’d always wanted a cat of my own, having grown up caring for our neighbors’ feline friends when they were off on vacation or working a late shift. Suddenly, there were flocks of them demanding attention. Our guide rustled Darius back into the room while my husband and I began our walk-through amid every type of cat you could imagine &#8212; fat, thin, short hair, long hair, Siamese &#8212; playful, reclusive, hissing, and mewing in no certain symphony. To some degree, they must have been used to the game by now, competing for the chance to get out of this commune and leave the lazier of their brethren behind to become interminable lost causes. </p>
<p>Immediately after returning from his aborted escape, Darius became glued to us &#8212; to me &#8212; and followed my trail relentlessly from room to room, silent but determined to get out of this madhouse (regardless of how well cared for he was). An hour later, he was in our carrier and on his way home. I didn’t really make the choice, honestly. Darius chose for us.</p>
<p>Not everyone is an animal person, I admit. I’ve had many a houseguest over the years not particularly excited about the prospect of being singled out by Darius or another one of my cats. The rules are pretty much this: if you are wearing black, show little to no interest, and think keeping animals in the house just a little bit creepy, my cat will climb into your lap faster than if you opened a can of tuna over your head. This level of insistent devotion &#8212; pretty much a “whether you like it or not” proposition &#8212; from animals can be disconcerting to some, but I find it particularly endearing. They’re not exactly little persons, but the quality of personality we either project or recognize in our pets, as the case may be, resonates strongly with me. </p>
<p>It clearly does with one of the comic book industry’s superstars, Grant Morrison, as well. Morrison began his career in American comic books with the socially aware (while persistently wacky) <em>Animal Man</em>, wherein series star Buddy Baker frequently worked against those who would abuse, experiment on or otherwise mistreat the pals from whom he drew his considerable powers. The lead character in Morrison’s epic <em>The Filth</em> cares devotedly for his ailing cat Tony, and even viciously beats his para-personality replacement for letting Tony die on his watch. But it is in his collaboration with Frank Quitely, the brutally poetic <em>We3</em>, that Morrison’s true devotion to and understanding of our often silent furry friends take full shape.</p>
<p>Like Quentin Tarantino’s 2009 film <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>, a reconstructed fiction about Jewish resistance to Nazis during World War II, <em>We3</em> is a bit of a revenge fantasy for every animal ever done wrong by the inhumanity of man. Set in a military-industrial complex not unlike our own, this three-part limited series, published by DC Comics’ Vertigo imprint in 2004, follows the adventure of three military-grade weapons of mass destruction: a dog, a cat and a rabbit. Dubbed “Animal Weapon 3,” this branch of an experiment, blending domesticated beasts with a high-tech arsenal that would make the Terminator blush, is considered a grand success after the efficient elimination of an anti-American dictator. Despite positive outcomes, the call is made to decommission the three weapons. After a disturbing visit from Washington, it becomes all too obvious that the scientist caring for the animals treat them far better than she would an automatic rifle or war drone. Going so far as to teach each one basic English language skills, Dr. Berry finds herself soon to be out of a job and her furry friends in danger of being put down.</p>

<p>What follows is a madcap, but barbarically graphic, escape from the military facility for the animals now calling themselves We3, and each other by their numeric designation: 1, a canine retrofitted to resemble a small tank; 2, a cat designed to be a lethal stealth agent; and 3, the bunny trained to deliver mines and poison gas pellets into enemy territory. Language, as we soon discover, is only the tip of the iceberg to what separates man from beast, but it’s something Morrison uses effectively to center action precisely upon the animals, rather than on their human captors. It would be nearly impossible not to empathize with 3’s rapid obsessive chatter about fixing his broken tail, 1’s recurring concern about whether his actions make him a good or bad dog, or even 2’s animosity toward their former bosses with swears of <em>“Stink!”</em> at every challenge. By the end of their travels toward the elusive concept they refer to as “home,” Morrison has successfully defined each animal’s personality and motivation to such an individual degree &#8212; yet never forgetting that they are not, in fact, human. It would be easy to anthropomorphize, but the rawness to each weapon’s rationale is not simply survival instinct in action, but an honest reflection of how direct and unfettered by moral complexity the animals’ thought processes remain.</p>
<p>The illustration of time is another defining characteristic for <em>We3</em>’s treatment of the differences between animal and man. Indeed, as scientists postulate the passage of time to be perceived as much slower for small animals than for even larger non-humans, spatial adjustment must reflect temporal disparities on the page. When 2 moves to take down soldiers sent for him and his partners, the feline weapon is literally dancing between moments, ripping open aggressors faster than they can cognitively respond. Quitely executes spreads with movement in and out of panels <em>turned in space</em> to show how the action transcends recognition of its results for the human mind. Cause and effect are no longer purely consecutive endeavors. </p>

<p>Similarly, where an action has more ramifications than could possibly be noted from a single perspective, Quitely explodes out panels into dozens of intricately detailed components across the page. Each individual square layered on the primary image may represent a slightly different point of perspective in space, but also may follow through the next moment in time &#8212; leaving the reader with a sense that one hundred different points of damage are occurring simultaneously or, at least, faster than the camera can record. We’re left with the impression that animal senses exceed ours to such a great degree that new forms of representation have to be constructed just to translate information for human consumption. The artist is not distorting animalistic experience to fit into our comfortable worldview, but bending our perceptions to meet each beastly character on its own terms.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the only significant human perspective captured in the book is that of Dr. Berry, and even hers through a very distant lens. It would be easy to write her character off as shallowly constructed or one-note in her role as a post-millennial Doctor Doolittle, but subtle clues throughout the series point to her having a much more complicated back story. It is only because <em>We3</em> is rendered through the eyes of the three animal protagonists that revelations about anything beyond her devotion to their care is completely irrelevant. Her role is simply to reinforce and illuminate their identities, not the other way around. From the revelation of 1’s true name to his realization regarding the nature of their existence after a damaging firefight, all compelling moments in this adventure belong to <em>We3</em>. The after effects for humanity are simply not fundamental to the tale.</p>
<p>By the time my little Darius passed away last year, at thirteen years of age from cancer, I had already read <em>We3</em> more times than I can count. Not surprisingly, however, this book has never meant as much to me as it does today, after experiencing the loss of my first &#8212; and favorite &#8212; little pal. I often felt that I projected more personality onto my cat than was rational, particularly when I would share his exploits with the non-animal-lovers amid my friends and family. Now I’m not so certain. </p>
<p>Sure, Darius wasn’t a cybernetic killing machine, a fact that could have either lengthened or shortened (not entirely sure which) the three days I spent in tears after his departure. But he was a special little guy, and maybe even more special than I gave him credit for being. Like 1, he was deeply loyal to me, rarely wanting to separate himself from my side. Like 3, he would jump headlong into adventure without a second thought. And like 2, he wouldn’t take crap from anybody, even me. It’s probably for the best that all I had for him was a jaunty sweater and not a full-on war suit, but if <em>We3</em> teaches us anything, it’s not to underestimate those for whom humanity is not a defining characteristic &#8212; for good or ill. Seeing the world through their eyes for even a little while may not be the worst thing in the world after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My recreational research of animals and overactive imagination means I often entertain the idea of the possibility of movie monsters being real things.  For me this is my normal thought process and I don’t understand why everyone else isn’t more scared of this shit.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQNztpOnDw">Glow-in-the-dark cat clones are part of our world</a>, what’s so off-the-wall about thinking movie monsters could really happen?  Also, sometimes nature doesn’t need a whole lot of embellishment to be terrifying.   The abominations of the silver screen and their existence in the natural world can be easily linked with a little crazy creativity, and I’ve made a LIST.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alien</em> &amp; the Giant Isopod</strong></p>

<p>The giant isopod is like an aquatic woodlouse (roly poly) only, you know, bigger.  They can survive for eight weeks without food, but when these carnivorous scavengers scuttle over an abundant food source they’ll consume until they’re immobile</p>
<p>They don’t seem like much of a threat based on their fairly normal crustacean lifestyle, but I wouldn’t fall for that, “If your giant isopod is bigger than your face you have cancer” bullshit and put the crustacean up to your head.

<p>Seeing <em>Arachnophobia</em> as a child mainly scared me on account of how hard it was to kill the spider at the end.  That damn thing was the Rasputin of arachnids.  But stomp on something hard enough and it will stop living, right?</p>
<p>Probably not the Cyclocosmia spider.</p>
<p>It looks like it has a boot print on its ass from getting stomped on and NOT DYING. Science explains the weird truncated abdomen is its protection.  The hardened disc serving as a plug for the spiders borrow to keep unwanted visitors out and a means of camouflage.</p>
<p>Shut up, science! Spider voodoo surely keeps it alive!</p>

<p>Even Steve McQueen ran his bad ass away from <em>The Blob</em>, the gelatinous amorphous creature that fell from the sky.  To find nature’s blob hopeful look not up, but down.</p>
<p>The sea pig lives at great depths on the ominously named abyssal plain in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans.  Kinda cute as members of the sea cucumber family go, but like many kinds of sea cucumber, sea pigs are often found in huge numbers.  A gigantic mass of pink squishy things, you say?  Like. . . a BLOB?</p>
<p>It’s still too early to tell the extent of the damage from the BP oil spill.  It could some-crazy-how cause sea pigs to fuse together to form a carnivorous pink glob.  An angry glob.</p>

<p><em>Evil Dead 2</em>, while gloriously campy, does genuinely frighten me a bit.  Aside from the stab of panic I feel over the threat of ankle-grabbing cellar dwellers, there’s this possessed deer head. I used to live in far less fear with the knowledge that creepy deer with pointy teeth are not a thing, but then. . .</p>
<p>Instead of antlers Chinese water deer have what are technically classified as tusks, or, in murderous murdering terms, FANGS. Fangs the deer can actually MOVE. They can be drawn back out of the way while eating, or thrust forward to use in combat.  Like you do if you’re an evil deer.</p>
<p>In fact, according to Wikipedia, “Recently, the &#8216;vampire deer have made headlines in Southern Tennessee because &#8216;Aimee,&#8217; a small female, had escaped from a Marietta, Mississipp farm and displayed aggressive behavior towards visitors on the Natchez Trace Parkway.”</p>
<p>Wait. Tennessee?  Where <em>Evil Dead</em> was filmed?  Oh, HELL.</p>

<p>If you’ve never seen this science fiction (ahem) * thriller * about <a title="Night of the lepus" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xulXFB3-A3c">carnivorous mutated rabbits</a> then you have wasted less of your life than I.  I thought the concept giant rabbits was a load of bullocks. And then I discovered these gigantic bunnies.</p>
<p>My first thought was literally, “OH, SHIT.  GIANT RABBITS.”  For though <em>Night of the Lepus</em> is ridiculous, the idea of a rabbit ripping your throat out is actually terrifying because, let’s face it, bunnies are supposed to be non-threatening.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcxKIJTb3Hg">Monty Python really knew what they were talking about</a>. The Flemish Giant Rabbits were bred large on purpose based on the notion that large rabbits equals lots more rabbit meat.  If <em>Jurassic Park</em> has taught us anything, it’s that if man manipulates nature, nature is bound to rip man’s throat open with it’s adorably oversized teeth.</p>

<p id="internal-source-marker_0.5833292347100938" dir="ltr">
<p>Pokemon are weird bastard animals trained to battle other weird bastard animals with their magic to become more powerful, or whatever. It’s a little scary if you think about it (battles aren’t to the death, because, you know, the children.  But if it weren’t for the children you know these things would be slaughtering the shit out of each other).</p>
<p>I realize a Pokemon Lightning Dragon isn’t a movie monster, but, seriously, look at this sea slug and tell me your first thought wasn’t, “It looks like a Pokemon!”</p>
<p>The Nudibranchs thrive and reach their largest sizes in warm, shallow waters (where most humans like to swim).  If those waters were ever contaminated with whatever nuclear waste cocktail made Godzilla, well, you can see we&#8217;d have a problem.</p>
<p>Having shed their shells at the larval stage, Nudibrachs developed other means of defense.  Some types of Nudibranch prey on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Man_O%27_War">Portuguese Man O’ War</a>, which is slightly terrifying on its own.  Nudibranchs don’t kill the Man O’ War, they just eat off its most potent nematocysts (stinging cells) and rather than digest them, the slug passes them from its gut to the surface of its skin to use for protection.  Explain it with as much science as you want, it seems like gaining experience points and leveling up to me.  It’s just a matter of time before a slew of Nudibranchs mutates and start collecting us all.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zombies! </em>&amp; The Greenland shark</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Greenland Shark" src="https://i1.wp.com/2009oceans5.wikispaces.com/file/view/greenlandShark.jpg/114501201/greenlandShark.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="259" /></p>
<p>My first thought when I look at this shark?  Zombie.</p>
<p>If there were to be zombie fish, or a fish responsible for a zombie outbreak the Greenland shark would be the cause of it.  It lives in very deep, very cold water and it moves very slowly, much like the undead. Its lifespan is speculated to be 200 years (it’s 200 years old because it’s a damned ZOMBIE).  The perfectly logical explanation for the undead look of the eyes is a parasite called a Copepod that burrows into the shark’s cornea.</p>
<p>I don’t care what’s causing it.  It looks FUCKING. CREEPY.</p>
<p>Also, Greenland shark meat, considered a delicacy in Greenland and Iceland, is straight up toxic.  To prepare it you have to boil the hell out of it or bury it in the ground and let it freeze and thaw several times in order to ferment it.  Without this preparation consuming fresh, untreated Greenland shark meat may cause effects similar to “extreme drunkenness.”</p>
<p>You know what else resembles extreme drunkenness?</p>
<p>THE WALKING DEAD.</p>
<p>I’m not completely convinced that Greenland sharks are NOT Great White zombies.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you happen to be someone who was alone, forgotten or rejected on Valentines Day you may be thinking: Hell, even a damn dirty ape can get a date, and they don’t even have to send flowers!  Why not me?!”  Well, here’s a thought to cheer you up:</p>
<p>Yes, even stupid animals can find a partner, but there’s no way their mating rituals would work in the harsh dating world of the human race.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, these courtship strategies from the animal kingdom.  I have translated the animal behaviors into human dialogues to display the various degrees of failure that would ensue:</p>
<p><strong>1. The giraffe method</strong> <img data-attachment-id="3767" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/15/5-leas-unromantic-animal-mating-rituals/giraffe-tongue/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg" data-orig-size="640,577" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Giraffe Tongue" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=300&#038;h=270" alt="giraffe" title="Giraffe Tongue" width="300" height="270" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3767" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=300&amp;h=270 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=600&amp;h=540 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=150&amp;h=135 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>How can you tell she’s ready to go all the way?</p>
<p><strong>Guy:</strong>  Hi.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Hi.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> On your way to the bathroom?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> No.<br />
<em>Guy slaps her bottom a few times</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> How ‘bout now?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Yes, now I have to pee.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Oh good, could you save me some?  Here’s a mug.<br />
<em>A few minutes later, the Guy sips from the mug full of urine from the Girl who, for the purposes of this joke, has not yet run away</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Your urine is great!   Will you sleep with me?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> No.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Please?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> No. I’d like to keep my options open, if you don’t mind. I like older guys.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Okay, I’ll just follow you around all night with urine breath until you change your mind.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Oh, please don’t.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> No, it’s cool.  I’ll just be right next to you in case that older dude doesn’t show up. Then you can take pity on me.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong>  Security?</p>
<p>That’s right.  A male giraffe spots a female, head-butts her to induce urination so he can taste it to see if she’s ready to mate, and then follows her relentlessly until she gives in or another male shows up and they fight it out.  Fail.</p>

<p>When this lovely green bird goes after a mate he does so by locking beaks with a lady bird.  Kissing.  Normalish, yeah?  Wait for it. . .</p>
<p><strong>Guy:</strong>  Well, hello.  You’re very beautiful<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong>   Why thank you.<br />
<em>They kiss</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> That was wonderful<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I think I love you.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> I think I love you too.<br />
<em>Guy vomits into Girl&#8217;s mouth</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Ack! Gross! What are you doing?<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I’m showing my love for you by sharing my food!<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Sharing?  You just vomited in my mouth!<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Yep.  Mozzarella sticks. You like?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Get lost.</p>
<p>For these birds, second base is the male regurgitating the contents of his stomach into the female’s mouth. Maybe bird vomit tastes better than human vomit, but still. Ick.</p>

<p>These little apes engage in sex for almost everything.  Sounds awesome, right?  Let’s see if there can be too much of a good thing. </p>
<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Hello.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Hi.<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Meet my brother<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Meet my sister<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I’m hungry<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Look! A restaurant!<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> I’m angry with you for not paying for our meal!<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Don’t be angry!<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I’m sorry we almost got in an argument!<br />
<em>Lovemaking is initiated. . .</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Whoa, whoa whoa. Look, I’ve had about enough, okay? Five times in the last hour including an orgy with our siblings, and I&#8217;m exhausted, all right?  This isn’t fun anymore.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> You’re tired?  We should probably have sex to wake you up!<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Count me out.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Okay then, where’s your sister?</p>
<p>Bonobos use sex as a means of greeting. They have sex when they’re excited about finding food. They have sex instead of fighting or violence to resolve conflicts. (Holy crap, are they more advanced than us?) This means they have a less violent society as they tend to just, erm, “hug” everything (<em>everything</em>) out, but, seriously, who can keep up with that sort of lifestyle? Besides, as mentioned in the above dialogue, their social boundaries are way less strict. As in, it’s all in the family. Ew.</p>

<p>Ever have the feeling she wants a little more than you&#8217;re willing to give?  </p>
<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Hullo.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Hi, looking for a mate?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> As a matter of fact, I am. But I don’t actually want to look at you, talk to you, or have you around for any other reason than to fertilize my eggs.  Can you live with that?<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Sure!<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> I just need you to gnaw into my intestine and stay there until you dwindle down to an appendage full of sperm that can do its thing whenever my hormones tell you there are eggs to fertilize.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> So I’d lose my brain, heart and eyes and all sense of feeling?  What’s in it for me exactly?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> It would make me. . . happy?<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Pass.</p>
<p>Yep.  Male anglerfish just attach themselves to a female and dissolve down to nothing but glands, making the female anglerfish an independent woman.  All the women who are independent throw your fins up at me.</p>

<p>Aromatherapy, anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Hellooooo beautiful.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Uhm, hi.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Did you see what I did over there at the bar?  I fought all those other guys.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Yeah, I saw. I’m not really impressed.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Well then, allow me to show you another little trick of mine.<br />
<em>Guy drops his pants, turns around, proceeds to urinate and defecate in front of Girl</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> What do you think of that?  Pretty hot, right?<br />
<em>Girl recoils in disgust and runs away</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Wait! If you go all the way over there you can’t smell my poop! Here, I’ll shake my ass around so the scent can waft over to you! Where are you going?</p>
<p>Male hippos impress potential special lady friends by fighting at the old watering hole with each other and pooping themselves. The odor apparently does the trick for female hippos. Good for them.</p>
