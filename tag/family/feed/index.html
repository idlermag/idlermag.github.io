										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost seventeen years since I came out, not yet half my life, but edging closer to it year after year. Even way back then, I felt like I was coming into myself late, twenty-one years old and in my last year of college. Today, I read about out LGBT teenagers in high school (heck, even middle school) and I go slack-jawed in awe at the courage that must take. Not that it’s a new phenomenon &#8212; my best friend today was bravely out as a high school student &#8212; but I still think back to who I was at that age and how absolutely impossible that transition would have seemed. The closet is a remarkably cold place for something so insulated from everything around you. It appears to one as a protective armor, a shield from the risk of emotional and physical attack from outside oneself. The reality is that it is more like a straightjacket, a confining garment that constricts the more you struggle against it, until you manage to perform that one magic trick that releases your bonds.</p>
<p>Up until the days, weeks, months that I came out, I could imagine only the worst. As lonely and frighteningly tenuous as that closet feels when within its walls, representing myself with what is essentially a half-lie was the only life I knew until then. No matter what you read or witness or hear about life outside the closet, you can’t truly know it until you’ve made that leap. And that is scary stuff. It’s not as if the understanding of those around you &#8212; friends, family, colleagues &#8212; is completely antithetical to the truth. But sexuality pervades the very essence of each of us. Not our sum total, or even divisible half, but a strong current that flows through every aspect of our most basic selves, making it feel as if everything is tainted when that one part is misrepresented. The build-up of that sort of pressure can be crippling, but so too can its release be equally, if not more, freeing. </p>
<p>I was lucky in many ways in regard to my coming out. I got to choose the moment; it wasn’t chosen for me. I had time to prepare. Laugh if you must, but two of my dear friends &#8212; lesbians long out of the closet themselves &#8212; helped me make note cards with possible arguments to have on hand when I spoke with my parents on the phone. I had parents who loved me, not despite my sexuality, but in concordance with it. My friends were rock solid behind me, even afterwards when I spent the goodly part of a year “catching up” on every gay-themed film, book or discussion I could wrap my arms around. The tedium of that stage in my development for those around me cannot be overstated, I think. I was blessed to be studying (and eventually working) in a field where being gay was prevalent, moving to a major metropolitan city with a large gay population, and met my husband &#8212; now of nearly 15 years &#8212; pretty early on. So, today, it’s easy for me to look back at the process as if it couldn’t have gone any other way. And while I can assuredly echo that it almost always does indeed get better, the honest truth is that every LGBT story is not the same. Some situations, sadly, only get better by degrees.</p>
<p>Renee Montoya is the perfect, albeit fictional, representation of that truth.</p>

<p>One of several lead characters in DC Comics’ 2003 series <em>Gotham Central</em>, and focus of the second story arc entitled <em>Half a Life</em>, Renee Montoya is a detective in the major crimes unit of the Gotham City Police Department. A good cop in possibly the most corrupt city in the world, Montoya stands out among her peers as incorruptible, having even survived the political nightmare of a dirty (although well-meaning) partner, now since retired. She is tough, smart and has earned the trust of both the police commissioner and the Batman himself. And she has a secret.</p>
<p>Greg Rucka, sole writer on issues 6 through 10 of the series he alternately wrote with fellow Gotham scribe Ed Brubaker, presents a tale of the closet unraveling in possibly the worst-case scenario one can imagine. Not only does Montoya get outed publicly at work by the sudden appearance of a surveillance photo pinned to the bulletin board, but a series of orchestrated events lead her to become chief suspect in a murder investigation with protection of her lover Daria as the assumed motive. That plot evolution aside, however, Rucka delivers two key scenes to Montoya’s coming out narrative that boldly reflect his commitment to telling the harsh truth behind the detective’s circumstances: the counsel from Maggie Sawyer, Montoya’s superior officer, and a confrontation with her brother Ben over a similar photo delivered to their parents.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10919" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/01/24/better-by-half/halfalife2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg" data-orig-size="640,502" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HalfaLife2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=502" alt="Maggie Sawyer" width="640" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10919" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=235 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In Sawyer, Rucka presents someone who has come out the other side of Montoya’s travails, an out lesbian holding a significant position of power in what is historically one of the most homophobic and misogynistic professions. She is the golden ideal that Montoya, quite reasonably, cannot project her own future onto. Whether motivated by anger, fear, or most likely both, Montoya divides herself from Sawyer’s experience along lines of race and culture, positing that her boss did not come out as a Latina queer with a family tradition steeped in religious guilt and brimstone. This is a very true distinction and a bitter reality for women and men of color coming out from more traditional backgrounds and families. But there is also a sense that one can’t truly see the possibilities of an out life from inside the closet. The risks still appear to loom too heavily over the rewards, that even were Montoya to see her own future in a magic mirror, it would still remain unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Rucka’s ultimate argument on the closet, verbalized by Sawyer’s final thoughts to Montoya, is particularly astute: “It’s a one-way door, Detective. Once the closet is open, it doesn’t shut again. What you do next, you get to live with it for the rest of your life.” Whether she realizes it or not at the time, Montoya takes this advice into the next encounter with her brother, who shares their parents’ dismay over the shock of her lesbianism.</p>

<p>Ben Montoya isn’t just coming to this news, however. His sister shared her secret with him over ten years before, to poor reception. His role in enabling her closet by covering for Renee’s sexuality with their parents is an insidious, but common aspect of the type of open secret. Those family and friends who cannot immediately accept and embrace their LGBT sister or brother become implicit in the half-lie, reinforce the closet walls as it were, and are posed to suffer from its destruction as well. Ben takes it upon himself to convince his parents the photograph they received in the mail was doctored, that some freak criminal sent it as method of destroying their daughter’s credibility. As it stands, that’s pretty much what happened, but Montoya’s unwillingness to go along with his continued illusion of her heterosexuality is distinctly powerful. As they argue, notably shifting into Spanish to speak in their parents’ language of origin, Montoya expresses clearly her belief that being gay is at the core of her being, not a so-called “lifestyle choice,” and that it is in fact a positive part of herself. No matter what institutions and preconceived notions crumble around her now, she has that admission to depend on. Rucka may throw madmen and dirty cops and frame jobs at his fictional heroine, but this foundation of self-worth and respect means the reader can fight back alongside her, reflecting back her righteous indignation and pride.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10921" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/01/24/better-by-half/halfalife4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg" data-orig-size="640,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HalfaLife4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=490" alt="aftermath" width="640" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10921" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=115 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=230 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><em>Half a Life</em> ultimately owes a great deal to the artistic abilities of illustrator Michael Lark as well. Lark’s rough pencils and deep shadows reinforce not just the grit and grime of Gotham City, but also perfectly reflect the emotional tenuousness behind Montoya’s experience. She is a hard woman at her face, but builds that exterior on a shaky foundation, all the more represented by Lark’s sketched quality of line. Montoya’s range of emotion expressed through Lark’s pencils is nothing short of fantastic, as he takes the reader through every reaction the detective has &#8212; stoic or otherwise. Combined with Rucka’s trademark care for his deeply conflicted heroine, the story of Renee Montoya’s coming out stands as one of the most brutally honest, and deeply realized, reflections of the reality of LGBT life in America, even today. Times may have changed, politics are evolving, but the closet &#8212; that straightjacket of half-lies &#8212; still has a power deeply rooted in a fear and anger that won’t go away in a matter of decades. Thankfully, stories like this one have an inherent power as well, owing to the deep sense of reverence their creators have for their subject matter. As a result, for many readers gay and straight alike, it’s hard to imagine it gets better than this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s probably pretty clear by now that I’ve read more than my share of comic books. I have about fifteen thousand in my personal collection, curated carefully over the last thirty years, not to mention the thousands more I’ve read and subsequently donated to worthy causes. I still pick up an insane number of new books each month, but can genuinely say I enjoy them all. There doesn’t seem to be much point, after everything I’ve read, to suffer bad stories anymore &#8212; especially when there are always so many good ones to be found on the monthly rack or in the back issue bin. Nonetheless, there is a single comic book that has never quite managed to be topped in my mind and heart, and with good reason. A unique treatise on the power of family, the story “Who is Donna Troy?” still resonates with me after a hundred, possibly two hundred reads, just as strongly as it did the first time I opened its pages.</p>
<p>Originally published in DC Comics’ <em>New Teen Titans</em> #38 in 1984, “Who is Donna Troy?” begins as a curious play on the classic detective story. Dick Grayson, the young man known to the world as Robin, sits in a dark room that feels lifted from every noir film to feature a grizzled sleuth, just waiting for some femme fatale to stroll in the door and turn his life upside-down. Light slides between slits of the window blinds, creating patterns against the hero’s trench coat as he sits down with his coffee to silently review his case files. Dick’s inner monologue is every bit the cliché you expect from a movie detective from the ‘30s or ‘40s, crafting himself as a solitary figure emotionally distanced from those around him. The reality couldn’t be further from the truth, and co-plotters Marv Wolfman and George Perez know it. In actuality, Dick has grown up surrounded by family and friends, first in the spotlight of the circus, then later at Batman’s side and among his peers in the Teen Titans. As a result, Wolfman and Perez beautifully set up this brief façade &#8212; both within Dick’s physical surroundings and own thought process &#8212; to accentuate just how far from hackneyed this tale is going to tread.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10753" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/11/08/sisters-and-brothers-wonder-girls-and-boy-wonders/donna1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg" data-orig-size="640,631" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Donna1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=631" alt="Dick Grayson, private dick" title="Donna1" width="640" height="631" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10753" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=148 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/donna1.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=296 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The key irony to this scene is that Donna Troy has never been a femme fatale, but rather was known for many years (perhaps in great part because of this very story) as the girl everyone wants as a best friend. Kind to a fault, equal parts warrior and compassioned ally, Donna is a super-heroic Mary Tyler Moore, whose only darkness rests in the uncertainty about her own origins. Rescued from a tenement fire as an infant by Wonder Woman, Donna remembered nothing of her past prior to her arrival on the mythic Paradise Island. Raised as Wonder Woman’s sister by her mother Queen Hippolyte, and granted similar powers through technological means, Donna became the teenage heroine Wonder Girl and helped found the Teen Titans with Robin. Since day one, Donna had been committed to the team, coming to regard them as her own adopted family in lieu of any recollection of a birth family. Nevertheless, now coming up on the eve of her wedding, it seems to Wonder Girl more important than ever to know where she came from and who she really is. It’s a tension a lot of adopted children experience as they grow older, but one for Donna that fortunately does not seem alien or hurtful to the family of friends she’s gathered around her. Dick Grayson, an orphan himself, perfectly understands her dilemma, and while he briefly knew and enjoyed a life with his birth parents, Donna’s need for a connection to her past resonates strongly within him.</p>
<p>Donna and Dick’s relationship is one of the most rare in comics, perhaps even pop culture as a whole, in that they are and always have been completely platonic, but deeply connected friends. This dynamic between a heterosexual male and female, particularly in their teens, is far more unusual than one might think. Time and time again, television and books seem to need to address sexual attraction between every male and female lead, but here the writers consistently represent Dick and Donna as solely the closest of friends. Brother and sister in a carefully constructed family, these two are bound not by blood, but by a lifetime of shared adventures and similar loss. It’s a much more difficult dynamic for writers to capture, as it bucks almost every tradition Western culture has tried to maintain regarding heterosexual inevitability, but Wolfman and Perez seem to instill it effortlessly, between these two characters in particular.</p>

<p>While Donna’s desire to know her past may not create familial tension with her groom-to-be or brother-in-arms, her frustration over the process of discovery does reverberate through her relationships. She may not think twice when barreling after the Fearsome Five or throwing a punch at the Terminator, but when confronted by the brick walls of her family history, Wonder Girl may have found her greatest weakness. She does at times project the same misgivings upon Robin, however unwarranted. Ward to the world’s greatest detective, Dick is no slouch when it comes to solving mysteries. That he in fact does so in a single comic book issue is its own meta-reading of Dick Grayson’s expertise, although it also typifies an era when single plotlines were not stretched over six to nine issues of decompressed storytelling. Inevitably, Dick strikes out on his own to find answers on Donna’s behalf, because despite her protests, he knows her heart as well as he knows his own. The family reunions, three to be exact, that Donna is graced with as a result of Dick’s love and dedication (and no small measure of pride), still create the same lump in my throat and tear-filled eyes that I had the first time I read this issue.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, Perez’s ability to capture facial emotion and body language so eloquently goes a long way toward contributing to my sentimental nature about Donna’s origin story. Every character is distinctively drawn and immediately recognizable in Perez’s <em>New Teen Titans</em> run, not needing to rely on costumes, clothing cues or even hairstyles to adequately differentiate Donna or Dick from other recurring family members or passers-by. Each character is a unique person, as flawed and perfectly individual as those people we know in our day-to-day lives. I frankly can only name a handful of other artists of super-hero comics about which I could say the same, and none of which render their charges nearly as effectively.</p>

<p>But honestly, “Who is Donna Troy?” just isn’t your normal super-hero tale anyway. No punches are thrown. No super-villains show up to move the plot along or introduce witty banter. Indeed, the very fact that Wonder Girl and Robin put on their costumes for any part of this issue seems only in service to the series as a whole; Donna and Dick’s deductive activities certainly don’t necessitate it. What this story excels at doing is removing all the faux action super-hero comics are usually packed with and letting honest motivations and character relationships unveil the dramatic potential of the story instead. While exploding buildings or invading hoards from outer space may often punctuate Donna’s experience of her expanded family, it is more appropriately defined by the smaller moments and revelations between them &#8212; not unlike our own.</p>
<p>As someone lucky enough to have both a strong connection to my family of origin and a constructed family of choice, I get to experience a lot of the joy that Donna sees in her own clan. “Who is Donna Troy?” may ultimately be the most perfect single comic book I’ve read for that reason alone, because it narrows down everything I believe to be true about family &#8212; that ties of friendship are as important as blood, that finding joy is paramount no matter what the odds, and every family deserves the right to define itself by its own best terms. Thanks, Donna and Dick, for being shining reminders of these truths, even all these years later. It’s no wonder I still think of you as one of my best examples for how important best friends and family can be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d like to clear up a bit of a myth &#8212; you can actually follow either <em>Animal Man</em> or <em>Swamp Thing</em> without reading the other. Writers Jeff Lemire and Scott Snyder have clearly spent the first year of the two titles building a common world with a number of common elements and themes, but they each have their own plan. Together, the two titles considered together form a dark, rich tapestry, but they&#8217;re each outstanding titles on their own. You don&#8217;t have to read both <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em>, although I can&#8217;t imagine why you wouldn&#8217;t want to.</p>

<p>At first glance, Buddy Baker and Alec Holland don&#8217;t have much in common. Baker is a sometime actor and stuntman who has embraced his public role as Animal Man not just to fight crime, but to be an advocate for animal issues. He&#8217;s married with a son and a daughter, and while his acting career has never really taken off, he&#8217;s just starred in a little indie film which is garnering a some attention and even a hint of Oscar buzz. In the pages of <em>Animal Man</em>, there&#8217;s an ongoing contrast between the humble, salt-of-the-earth (I&#8217;m trying to avoid the phrase white trash) nature of the Baker family, and the way modern media occasionally intrudes on the story &#8212; the first page of the first issue of <em>Animal Man</em> is a faux interview with Buddy Baker from the deeply hip magazine <em>The Believer</em>, and most of the sixth issue consists of scenes from Baker&#8217;s indie film <em>Tights</em>, as viewed on Baker&#8217;s son&#8217;s smartphone while the family is on the run in their RV.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10625" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/28/521-the-varieties-of-horror/hollandconstruction/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg" data-orig-size="640,394" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hollandconstruction" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=640&#038;h=394" alt="Alec Holland, contractor" title="hollandconstruction" width="640" height="394" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10625" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=300&amp;h=185 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Alec Holland, on the other hand, is a renowned plant biologist who in the first issue of <em>Swamp Thing</em> is working in construction. He&#8217;s recently returned to life after a lab explosion years ago to find not only that his wife wasn&#8217;t so lucky, but that he shares memories with a monstrous superhero animated by a force known as the Parliament of Trees using what they were able to salvage of Holland&#8217;s personality after his death. The Parliament now wants Holland to become their champion himself as they had always intended, and he feels the unwanted pull of that destiny in both his waking hours and in his dreams.</p>
<p>But for all their differences, Baker and Holland have one thing in common. Their lives have been shaped and directed by forces that are beyond anything they had ever imagined, and the first year of each of their titles can be read as an extended cinematic pull back shot. In every issue, the frame expands a little, revealing a world bigger, deeper, stranger, and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In the New 52, Animal Man and Swamp Thing are revealed to be champions (&#8220;avatars&#8221;) for the constantly battling forces of animal and plant life, known as The Red and The Green, both of which oppose the embodied force of death known as The Rot. In times of balance, each of the three forces keeps the others in check. If things were in balance, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have much of a story, and both titles at the inception find themselves in a place where the way things are is far from the way things should be.</p>
<p>In <em>Animal Man</em>, artist Travel Foreman evokes this dislocation by creating a world of open, realistic but flattened spaces with bizarre, hyper-detailed intruders. (Steve Pugh largely takes over by issue #7, but maintains Foreman&#8217;s overall stylistic deisgn.) Buddy Baker and his family are pursued by a grotesque, distended group calling themselves The Hunters Three who can consume living beings and wear their skins. The Hunters are portrayed as occasionally struggling to fit within their assumed shapes, which become cartoonishly distorted when a hunter is distracted or fatigued. Nothing about the process is pleasant or pretty. &#8220;This will hurt very badly,&#8221; one of the hunters tells a victim as he is being eaten, &#8220;but I need your sssskin. . .&#8221;</p>

<p>The flatness of Buddy Baker&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; world is a vivid illustration of the new series&#8217; central revelation. While Baker has been empowered by the Red as the <em>de facto</em> champion of the animal world, he is only a placeholder. The untimely death of the Red&#8217;s previous avatar left them in need of a temporary replacement, so they granted some of the next avatar&#8217;s abilities to her father. Maxine Baker&#8217;s connection to the Red far exceeds anything Buddy Baker has ever experienced, and her nacent powers already far exceed his own. Maxine is also just four years old, and for all her power, far from able to protect herself from the Lovecraftian figures pursing her.</p>
<p>While Buddy Baker finds himself a smaller figure in a bigger world, a custodian more than a champion, then Alec Holland is precisely the opposite, the champion who was taken from the Green and has now returned. Holland, however, wants nothing to do with the destiny the Green so fervently desires that he embrace, and he finds himself trying to prune back the tendrils the Parliament of Trees have wrapped around his soul. Fittingly, Yanick Paquette&#8217;s art is lush, flowing, and sometimes oppressively detailed. In the second and third issues, Holland meets a kindred spirit in Abigail Arcane, a woman whose family has a deep connection to the Rot, and who has a history with the Alec Holland simulacrum that was the previous Swamp Thing. Holland finds himself irresistibly drawn to Abigail, defending her life against both the Rot seeking to reclaim her, and the Green&#8217;s demands that he destroy her. </p>

<p>In different hands, we might have had two strong but unrelated titles, the interim hero and the reluctant champion with their very different stories in their own separate worlds. Linking the two together is a brilliant idea which has been executed with what I&#8217;m certain was no little effort and a great deal of skill. The star-crossed lovers and the father defending his progeny are both classic, even primal stories, but together they form a rich and unexpected epic about blood and family, and creating a future beyond what is encoded within history and genetics.</p>
<p>Because of this, <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em> are comics about heroism and not just superheroes. Both titles have seen, groundbreaking work in the past (as written by Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, respectively), but they existed for all practical purposes in their own pocket narrative universes. With their New 52 incarnations, Snyder and Lemire have been able to bring themes (and a level of quality) more often found in indie comics or imprints like Vertigo to the mainstream DC universe. It&#8217;s an effort whose first fruits are just beginning to mature, but the ground is rich, and there&#8217;s the promise of even better to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year into DC&#8217;s reboot of their primary continuity, known as the New 52, <em>Idler</em> comics writer Matt Santori-Griffith and co-editor Gavin Craig are taking stock of some of the high points. This week, they talk about Wonder Woman&#8217;s revitalized mythology, and how family seems to be a central concern of the best titles of the New 52. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It strikes me as very curious that all of the books we chose to discuss for this month devoted to DC&#8217;s New 52 have central themes — if not dominating themes — about family. And not constructed families, but families bound by blood. Of all of them, <em>Wonder Woman</em> definitely hits this note the hardest.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Out of all the New 52 titles, <em>Wonder Woman</em> for me has been the biggest surprise, although maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be. As a member of DC&#8217;s &#8220;trinity,&#8221; Wonder Woman has often felt like the junior member, in sales or big memorable stories if not power or character. When I&#8217;ve dipped into <em>Wonder Woman</em> in the past, she&#8217;s felt like someone different almost every time. Which is fine for a character like the Joker, but not for a daughter of the Amazons. Giving her a family seems to have been a good move. It&#8217;s given her a center. And worthy antagonists.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Which is interesting, because I have the opposite reaction. I have read <em>Wonder Woman</em> every month for nearly 30 years and feel like we haven&#8217;t seen THAT much variety in her perspective over time. That&#8217;s not a dig at any previous run, but for me points to a certain preciousness about her character that the other two members of the Trinity aren&#8217;t as subject to. Azzarello and Chiang have taken a great departure from what has come before, and I am enjoying it if even just for what it implies about her iconic (or dare I say mythological) nature.</p>

<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yeah, I think what I&#8217;m talking about would be more an impression of inconsistency &#8212; probably growing out of a central uncertainty in the casting of Diana&#8217;s character. She&#8217;s normally been a character sort of torn between two worlds &#8212; Themyscira and the mortal world &#8212; but not entirely at home in either. Done well, that sort of tension can be really rich, but if a writer is uncertain about the character, or not totally comfortable in both those worlds, it can lead to weak storytelling. I love that Azzarello has basically cut that Gordian knot.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Well, Diana being torn between two worlds has been a factor over time at certain points (most notably during George Perez&#8217;s magnificent post-Crisis run on the title), but more often than not, her mother and sisters have been made inaccessible to her by a variety of plot devices. So many times, I have a hard time imagining the tension as that real any more. But the tension between being human and being godly? Now that&#8217;s a new one. And exceedingly interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The way that Azzarello has revealed Diana&#8217;s new history &#8212; not shaped from clay by her mother and given life by the gods, but the biological daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, a fact hidden from Diana in order to protect her (and Paradise Island) from Hera &#8212; has been a big part of what makes the title work. As you said when we were talking about <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/06/521-the-bat/">Bruce Wayne and the Court of Owls</a>, it&#8217;s a retcon, but it&#8217;s not just an abrupt change, it&#8217;s written as information that was hidden from Diana and the world for a reason, and we get to share in Diana&#8217;s readjustment to her new understanding of herself.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Right. And it&#8217;s funny, but other than a few minor details (not being able to fly until #12), I can&#8217;t reasonably think why Diana&#8217;s entire post-Crisis history can&#8217;t still be in play. Until we&#8217;re told otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> And that&#8217;s probably a big observation worth making about the New 52: For a continuity-altering reboot, it&#8217;s left room for a lot of great old stories to be able to carry forward &#8212; titles like <em>Batwoman</em> and <em>Batman Incorporated</em> are big obvious examples where the reboot affects almost nothing, but DC (at least in some places) has done an amazing job of letting writers take a character in a new direction in a way that&#8217;s still amazingly faithful to who they&#8217;ve been in the past. (Like <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/13/521-the-girl-most-likely-to/">Barbara Gordon</a>, for example.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I understand the frustration many DC Comics fans (and in particular long-time Wonder Woman fans) have experienced, but I also think we don&#8217;t have a lot of perspective on what&#8217;s being accomplished here yet. Being able to break from previous storylines in such a way that doesn&#8217;t necessarily negate anything, but allows the writers to pick and choose what aspects of a character to emphasize, really reinforces how legendary these icons are. Comic books are modern mythology, and like the different portrayals of the Greek gods (over centuries, but heck, even just over the last 20 years in <em>Wonder Woman</em>), there&#8217;s always another angle or interpretation to enjoy. Some will get revisited. Ultimately, they are all true.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> &#8220;Ultimately they are all true.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s exactly right. I think you really can&#8217;t undervalue what Azzarello has done in terms of recasting Diana&#8217;s place in the cosmos, especially since while it might seem to lend itself to criticism as character aggrandizement (&#8220;Oh great, not only is she an AMAZON, now she&#8217;s <em>Zeus&#8217;s daughter</em>.&#8221;), but there&#8217;s a way in which Diana has been sort of set apart from the general superhero universe. I&#8217;m really happy to see that she&#8217;s starting to show up in titles like <em>Batwoman</em>, but I think it&#8217;s no accident that she hasn&#8217;t had any guests in her own title. Characters like Bruce Wayne always seemed a bit uncomfortable on Olympus, but I almost have a hard time imagining someone like Apollo even deigning to take notice of him.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I had thought about the break from compartmentalization with the Batwoman/Wonder Woman team-up as a good thing almost exclusively from the <em>Batwoman</em> side, but it&#8217;s true in relation to Diana&#8217;s title as well. Re-reading <em>Wonder Woman</em> 1-12 as a set was pure joy, but the opportunity to see a little bleed over from the main DC Universe is tempting as well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily think of the recasting of Diana as Zeus&#8217; daughter is that prone to the criticism of aggrandizement as much as it has been offensive to those who preferred an exclusively female-centered origin for Diana&#8217;s birth and development.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Makes sense, although I&#8217;ve really appreciated the portrayal of the derision Diana got from at least some of the other Amazons. Even as the perfect Amazon, untainted by the touch of man, things aren&#8217;t perfect.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That actually speared my heart a little. &#8220;Clay.&#8221; Honestly, what a cruel name. But it is a little unbelievable that a nation of any human beings, exclusively female or not, could be so idyllic as to never resent their monarchy or the princess who everyone loves just a little bit more than each one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> No one wants a perfect sibling.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Of course, Diana certainly doesn&#8217;t have to worry about standing above her newfound siblings in the same way. It&#8217;s not a question in my mind that Diana is a better woman, person, or god than Strife or Apollo, but they certainly wouldn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Getting back to the question of family, I agree wholeheartedly that throwing Diana into the middle of a big, confusing, lumpy family with conflicting desires and shifting loyalties has been the single best storytelling move Azzarello could have made. I think that you&#8217;re right that a big part of what makes Diana&#8217;s story right now compelling is the way that all of her struggles have been given the urgency of blood relation, but I think that he&#8217;s doing something else as well. I was really happy that we got to run <a href="http://wp.me/p1KCPb-6W" target="_blank">our conversation about the various Robins</a> as an &#8220;outtake,&#8221; because it has a lot to do with what&#8217;s going on here. We talked a bit about the additional tension in Bruce and Damien Wayne&#8217;s relationship because he&#8217;s the first Robin, the first of Bruce&#8217;s many sons to be a blood relation. But it&#8217;s really important that while Damien&#8217;s blood relation means that Bruce feels responsible for Damien&#8217;s shortcomings in a way that he doesn&#8217;t for, say, Jason Todd, it&#8217;s also true that to Bruce and Alfred (and I think most of us) all of the Robins are Bruce&#8217;s sons. Ward, adoptee, or biological, they&#8217;re all family.</p>
<p>Now this is a really tough thing to try to portray &#8212; that is, family of choice or circumstance as not being lesser than biological or traditional family construction. There&#8217;s something Azzarello can do with the Greek gods that&#8217;s otherwise challenging (but not quite impossible) &#8212; he can create blood relations that actually do a better job of portraying the complexity and contingency of blood relation by taking advantage of the prolificacy of immortality, as well as its destruction of normative family relations based on age seniority.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I&#8217;ve been thinking about this blood versus constructed family thing a lot lately as well, because of <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/16/hopelessly-devoted/" target="_blank">my recent look at <em>Hopeless Savages</em></a>. There actually aren&#8217;t that many blood related families in comics. Lots of orphans. Many many constructed families that I hold extremely dear. But outside of the Fantastic Four, not many &#8220;families&#8221; come from requirement rather than choice. The Olympians are far more a family of requirement for Diana than one of endearment, and I don&#8217;t get the sense that that will ever change. However, it&#8217;s curious, because her strongest tie at the moment is to Zola, the woman who will bear her half-brother, and to whom she&#8217;d really not be related to in even the most generous of family trees. What is it about Zola&#8217;s predicament that compels such loyalty in Diana? I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s not about family or her situation at all. It&#8217;s that she needs help. Azzarello&#8217;s Diana is no different than any previous iteration. She is selfless and as she tells her uncle Hell, &#8220;I love everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, by the way, was the moment I lost any doubt about whether or not Azzarello gets Diana. If you understand that Diana simply loves everyone, you understand her everything.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Indeed. The entire world is family to Diana. Blood (in the traditional sense) doesn&#8217;t have much to do with it. She helps the one most in need of help. Zola perhaps even more than her child. On Olympus, everyone is family, and no one loves anyone. Diana is the mirror image of that. Except for Hephaestus! I love him. &#8220;No one loves himself more than Eros.&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;And I love [him] even more that that.&#8221; He&#8217;s the one character who could say that in this comic &#8212; the most traditional expression of paternal love &#8212; and I totally believe him.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I agree. And Hephaestus illuminated Diana&#8217;s biggest failing as well when she attempted to liberate her Amazon brothers from their &#8220;slavery.&#8221; At the end of the day, Wonder Woman lives in a world of black and white. Moral greys don&#8217;t really factor in. Once decided on a course of action, she acts, and while that makes her an exceedingly strong super-hero, it produces a conundrum at times, particularly in regard to family.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m not always right.&#8221; Acting and not always being right is just about the perfect formula for good fiction. Or even better, drama, in the ancient Greek sense. As opposed to Strife&#8217;s <em>drama</em>, in the contemporary sense.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Upon re-reading, I absolutely adored that Strife was not a traditional villain, nor even much of an antagonist for Diana, but almost a big sister ruthlessly teasing her little sister.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Strife is great. She does nothing but tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Any thoughts on historical/mythological versus comic book literary influences for the Amazons?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Not a whole lot specifically, except that it&#8217;s another good example of drawing the best of old sources while not feeling limited by them. Kind of like the character design. Every mythological character in <em>Wonder Woman</em> feels like they&#8217;re totally in character, and how great is it that they&#8217;re not all just drawn as traditional chiseled-marble humans in togas? There are a lot of great reveals in <em>Wonder Woman</em>&#8216;s first year, but Poseidon&#8217;s full-page introduction (which is actually drawn by Tony Atkins) was astounding.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> There is something so&#8230; ugh, I don&#8217;t have the word&#8230; elementary about the standard comic book depiction of the gods. Poseidon&#8217;s reveal was definitely a highlight, but so too was that last image of Hell staring into his reflection before Diana shot him with Eros&#8217;s revolver. For as monstrous as some of them are, they too are weak and vulnerable.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10532" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/20/521-wonder-woman/hell/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hell.jpg" data-orig-size="640,338" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hell" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hell.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hell.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hell.jpg?w=640&#038;h=338" alt="hell" title="hell" width="640" height="338" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10532" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hell.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hell.jpg?w=150&amp;h=79 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hell.jpg?w=300&amp;h=158 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I love Hades/Hell. Drawing him as a small boy with an emo candle-wax obscured face is just perfect. He&#8217;s all hurt feelings and inadequacy.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I also loved that you never saw Aphrodite&#8217;s face when she appeared in issue 9, as if the comic book panel couldn&#8217;t adequately describe her beauty anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> You made the point about comic books being modern mythology, and I think the reverse is true as well. Myths were the comic books of their day &#8212; Homer&#8217;s vivid depictions of how spears destroyed people&#8217;s faces and knocked out their teeth as they died &#8212; and Azzarello and Cliff Chiang really letting their imaginations run wild on how the gods look as well as what they do is actually more faithful to the ancient myths than it would be to draw the gods as walking Greek statuary. After all, what have the gods been doing all these years? It&#8217;s exactly right that War has never had a moment of rest, and that Eros would never let himself look less than perfect, whatever perfect means at the particular time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a moment I caught re-reading #4 that I skimmed past on my first read. When Hera confronts Hippolyta, she asks Hippolyta how she could have betrayed her as another woman. Hera is interrupted by the arrival of the rest of the Amazons to protect their queen, but in the last moments that the two are alone, Hera asks &#8220;What did he say to make you love him? What can I do to make him. . .&#8221; She never finishes that sentence, but it&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s asking Hippolyta what she can do to make Zeus love her. It&#8217;s heartbreaking. Again, the vulnerability behind the rage.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I felt the exact same thing. These gods are so fallible. The concern has been that Diana&#8217;s characterization has seemed weak (although that&#8217;s not one I personally subscribe to), but if anything, we&#8217;re starting to see a Wonder Woman who is so much more together than her brethren, even in her most vulnerable moments. And then, there&#8217;s her powers. The reimagining of Diana&#8217;s bracelets (which have not directly represented submission for her alone since pre-<em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>) as holding BACK her power, not simply adding to it, is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I think the key to Wonder Woman&#8217;s strength, especially compared to her family, is that she owns her vulnerability, her love. She doesn&#8217;t hide them under force like the rest of her family, which is why they&#8217;re each overwhelmed by their vulnerabilities. I love how Diana&#8217;s powers are still becoming clear to us and (mostly) to her. It wasn&#8217;t totally clear before #12 that she couldn&#8217;t fly, although she can apparently walk on water.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> So now we have a Wonder Woman whose power level is unknown. That&#8217;s more than a little exciting. So many years, debates have gone on about whether she is at Superman&#8217;s level or not. Who cares? This is an entirely different ballgame, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Exactly. I love how many times when we&#8217;ve asked specific detail or continuity questions, the answer has come back to &#8220;who cares?&#8221; I think you and I can obsess over detail with the best of them, but that&#8217;s been one of the big shortcomings of previous attempts to &#8220;clean up&#8221; continuity. It&#8217;s about telling a great story. You need to be consistent within the bounds of the story you&#8217;re telling, but that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> There have been a lot of cosmetic changes. Diana wields a much larger arsenal than just her lasso, frequently brandishing a sword. No longer an American resident, Diana lives in a London flat and frequents a metropolitan dance club. Perhaps reflecting this move, her costume has a much darker palette. For me, these items have really illuminated, rather than obscured, some of the things that I love dearly about Diana. Her wit. Her adaptability. Her kick-assness.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I think you hit on it when you talked about her iconic nature. As a big Batman geek, I&#8217;d be the first to say that what makes him so great isn&#8217;t the consistency of his continuity, it&#8217;s the way that he&#8217;s infinitely malleable and still totally recognizable. If DC has finally recognized that about Diana, then we&#8217;re in for some great comics, and Chiang and Azzarello had a big hand in that realization. It almost (almost) pains me to say it, but as good as Snyder&#8217;s <em>Batman</em> is, I&#8217;d put <em>Wonder Woman</em> up as the best title of the New 52, every single month.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Totally agree. It&#8217;s not my heart&#8217;s favorite (as <em>Batgirl</em> holds that precious space), but it is probably my brain&#8217;s. And frankly, it&#8217;s not that far behind on the heart, either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who knows me at all knows I am not particularly musical. It’s not just that I can’t play an instrument or carry much of a tune. I don’t even have much of an ear for music. My iPod, at any given time, has about a dozen songs on it &#8212; ones that would make any sophisticated music fan blanche, I’m sure &#8212; that I listen to relentlessly and may rotate every few weeks. I buy a new song here or there, but my diehard CD collection consists of about two dozen albums, almost all by two or three different artists. I think I had one piano lesson as a child before begging my parents to just let me go back to my colored pencils and Bristol board. I just don’t <em>get</em> music the way I get more visual media. I never really have.</p>
<p>Looking back, many of the kids with whom I became close friends used music as an escape much the way I used comic books. If you grow up feeling different from your peers, or even your family, having something to take you out of that world &#8212; and into one where being different means being powerful and admired &#8212; is almost critical to make it through. It’s why I imagine so many of the most popular super-hero comics star teams. Outsiders, who sometimes might otherwise be hated or feared, band together to not only attempt something greater than themselves, but also to form a new family that accepts their uniqueness, even celebrates it. Occasionally, that team has been a blood-related family at the start (as is the case of Marvel Comics’ <em>Fantastic Four</em>), but most of the time, it is in strangers that the lonely or orphaned hero finds camaraderie and acceptance. Like forming a band with those other kids no one seems to want to hang around, comic book creators relentlessly imagine families not-so nuclear to grant characters and readers validation of their worth, oddities aside.</p>
<p>That non-nuclear families so pervade the comic book genre makes <em>Hopeless Savages</em> that much more unique for its own outsider status. Published in multiple mini-series by Oni Press and recently collected in a <em>Greatest Hits</em> edition, <em>Hopeless Savages</em> recounts the life of a punk rock couple, Dirk Hopeless and Nikki Savage, who left groupies and concerts behind for the white picket fence dream to have a family out in the suburbs. Far from losing themselves in the conformity of Middle America, the Hopeless-Savages have raised four <strong>extraordinary</strong> children, in every sense of that word. Named by their parents to forever remind them of their origins, Rat Bastard, Arsenal Fierce, Twitch Strummer, and Skank Zero Hopeless-Savage are unquestionably chips off their parents’ old block &#8212; cultural outsiders who didn’t have to look very far at all to find their accepting clan.</p>

<p>Rather than deliver a fairy tale existence for the entire family, however, series creator and writer Jen Van Meter goes to great lengths to make each child’s individuality a clear and central focus for the narrative. Eldest daughter Arsenal is a dojo master and martial arts expert from a family that urges peaceful, non-violent resolution whenever possible to conflict. Youngest son Twitch adheres to Mod style and subculture, a sharp departure from his parents’ dedication to the tenets of punk, but a distinction far more germane than his homosexuality. Eldest son Rat took the greatest leap away from his family’s standards in abandoning his hard-core punk style after receiving a teenage broken heart. Restyling himself to adopt the corporate fast track, Rat (calling himself Dave, after his father’s given name) is found at the beginning of the series after ten years away, working for a Starbucks-like coffee conglomerate. While Rat returns to the family dynamic in an urgent adventure to save his parents’ lives, he never quite goes back to his outrageous childhood self. In a house where everyone else is so sure of her or himself, Rat is still searching for his genuine identity, still trying to be comfortable in his own skin.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10379" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/16/hopelessly-devoted/twitch-2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/twitch.jpeg" data-orig-size="500,357" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Twitch" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/twitch.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/twitch.jpeg?w=500" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/twitch.jpeg?w=640" alt="Twitch" title="Twitch"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10379" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/twitch.jpeg 500w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/twitch.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/twitch.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>But it is around youngest daughter Zero that Van Meter’s story most steadily revolves, as the aspiring punk musician evolves from little girl to young woman. At the beginning of the series, Zero is a brash, determined child who speaks her mind unapologetically and gets in way over her head on a regular basis, particularly when her parents go missing in an apparent kidnapping. Of the entire family, Zero takes Rat’s departure most personally, only reluctantly including him in the search for Dirk and Nikki. She takes her parents’ legacy seriously, so much so as to brand Rat a traitor for choosing to leave behind the family name and business. Even so, Zero is the fiercest defender of Rat’s honor, even years later, in confronting the girl that broke his heart. Most like her mother in exuberant temper and sharp wit, Zero is intensely protective, even at a young age, of the life her mother left Nebraska to acquire. </p>
<p>Zero’s maturation into her own person in high school is no less tumultuous than normal, despite her one-track desire to follow in her mother’s footsteps. First true love hits hard in the form of Ginger Kincaid, another social outcast, but this time of the science nerd variety. The road to Zero and Ginger’s relationship is a mighty bumpy one, as a series of minor teenage misdeeds &#8212; and one serious offense in punching a boy at school for inferring too much from her given name &#8212; leads to extensive grounding at the hands of her overprotective mom. Drawn in the adolescent style now made famous by his <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> series, second series artist Bryan Lee O’Malley captures so perfectly the pains to which Zero and Ginger go through to finally align their stars. </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10380" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/16/hopelessly-devoted/ginger/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ginger.jpeg" data-orig-size="599,478" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Ginger" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ginger.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ginger.jpeg?w=599" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ginger.jpeg?w=640" alt="Ginger" title="Ginger"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10380" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ginger.jpeg 599w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ginger.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ginger.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p><em>Hopeless Savages</em> is uniquely blessed by many different artists, yet the differences never feel arbitrary &#8212; much like those of the family members themselves. Original series artist Christine Norrie may feel like the definitive penciller for a family somewhat rough around the edges, but other contributors (such as <em>Conan</em> and <em>Batman</em> artist Becky Cloonan and <em>Anya’s Ghost</em> creator Vera Brosgol) bring an almost mandatory eclecticism to the book. This is in some ways how I imagine an album must get assembled from multiple songs: each one has its own unique beat, but reflect a novel, yet important, aspect of the overall score. </p>
<p>The cast of <em>Hopeless Savages</em> is no different, each bringing his or her own individuality to the mix. How the story as whole comes together, though, is what lifts the readers’ spirits and inspires a great escape. Jen Van Meter has crafted a family we’d all want to join, but one that also ultimately leads us to look at our own &#8212; blood-born or made &#8212; and appreciate and admire the differences within. Not every family may stand out from those around them the way this punk rock tribe may, but it’s hard not to want to get yours to try after sharing their world for a little while.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My parents were divorced and my mom was mentally ill throughout most of my childhood so I didn’t always learn a lot about how to be a “proper” girl or woman &#8212; I’m an adult who is still figuring out liquid liner.  In a number of ways, I love that I wasn’t forced into a pink category, that I played Ninja Turtles and watched wrestling, that I had He-Man action figures and wore weird mismatched outfits of my choosing. So, please don’t take the following text to mean that my dad was some monster. This is definitely NOT the intent and in fact he’s a lot more like Santa Claus than anyone else I can think of. He did a pretty good job trying to help me be me and grow and take care of myself, but his lack of hair knowledge was a bit of a hindrance. He didn’t help me with my “Embarrassing Moments” hair woes because, as a man, he didn’t know they existed. What I know now that I didn’t then is that society is kind of a jerk to women and it expects a lot out of our bodies and out of our hair. I wish I had had a Frida Kahlo fairy godmother to help me suss this out earlier, or maybe Madonna, if she’d kept those thick spidery brows, or fellow helmet head Daria. But I didn’t. So, here are a few things I wish I had known.  </p>
<p><strong>I Wish Someone Had Taught Me:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The difference between high brow and low brow.</strong></li>
<p>When I was in the sixth grade I had full-on 80’s Madonna brows, the kind that have at least four regions to each brow, they’re so big. What no one told me was if you paid a professional to wax or expertly tweeze that bottom chunk, you could still be left with 2 fairly thick, yet fantastic eyebrows. Or, that pretty much anything is better than giving a sixth grader free-tweezing reign over her forehead hair because she is gonna pluck the fuck outta those suckers and then become a 31-year-old person who can list “growing brows” as a hobby on Facebook.</p>
<p>Ok, to be fair, I knew that waxing made the brows look amazing. My friends all shared stories about how their mom took them to Elizabeth Arden, or even a hair cutting place I had actually heard of. However, I felt I would not be afforded such a luxury &#8212; how could my dad understand that he’d be helping me shape the brows that would define my life?! I just wish future me could go back and give my lovely Madonna brows a pep talk, maybe with a Whoopie Goldberg <em>Ghost</em>-style speech to really get the point across, “Little self, put those tweezers down &#8212; you’re in danger, girl!”</p>
<li><strong>That straighteners exist and that naturally pretty hair is a lie.</strong></li>
<p>Okay, maybe not all pretty hair is a lie but at least that “pretty” is suspicious.  For about 25 years of my life I’ve assumed that popular girl hair was a magically bouncy, shiny and fantastic boon bequeathed upon only the richest and fanciest look-at-me-I-eat-at-Red-Lobster-and-it’s-not-even-a-special- occasion divas. In my younger days, I assumed that the Barbie girls just woke up with perfectly scrunchied barrel curls, bangs elegantly reaching skyward with a mere spritz of spray.  If they needed a little help perhaps a ritual blood-letting or a simple kitten sacrifice to Aphrodite, and voila! Perfection. (Because popular girls read their Edith Hamilton, right?) I was sure I was destined to my thick, coarse, bell-shaped helmet because all I had was a round brush, blow dryer, and my stupid Catholic saints to help me. </p>
<p>Alas, there is no Saint Perpetua de la Coiffure and I didn’t really have internet access until college, so you can imagine my shock when I discovered hair straightening technology. Science! After a quick 40-minute blow dry I can now straighten 500 or so tressy chunks of my head and thusly trick everyone into the belief that my mammalian strands are not just normal, but nice, even. Until it rains.</p>
<li><strong>That perms don’t belong on third graders.</strong></li>
<p>This should be self explanatory.  Why did we DO this?  Why did adults let us do this?  How was looking like Eraserhead &#8212; not to mention pouring pungent chemicals all over a child’s noggin &#8212; a cute trend in the way of slap bracelets and hypercolor t-shirts?!  Forget the face on Mars, this is a UNIVERSAL MYSTERY.</p>
<li><strong>That, “Hey, don’t shave all your parts.”</strong></li>
<p>When I got the green light from my dad to go ahead and shave my legs if I felt like it, I had a bit of a lightbulb moment. As I watched my gams shed their thick and lustrous Sasquatch fur, I felt a strange sensation of feminine empowerment. . . or was that the stinging pain of bleeding? Oh, how soft and silky and attractive my stems/stumps had become!  </p>
<p>What if&#8230;what if&#8230;What if I shaved the entirety of my body to be free of hairs (A.K.A. The Follicled Menace)?!! </p>
<p>Oh, and I did it.  Knuckles, elbows, face. Peach fuzz be damned, I’m a LADY!  What I wish I had the forethought to have seen at this turning point was that, much like the hair on my head, all those little hairs were gonna grow back &#8212; and thickly and thoroughly with a pokey vengeance and much itching.  And it’s stupid to shave your toe knuckles, Stupid. And hey, remember your dad’s face? How he shaves it and gets a 5 o’clock shadow at noon? Well, shit. So, “hey, don’t shave all your parts” would have been a nice heads up. That’s all I’m saying.</p>
<li><strong>That dyeing your mustache will just give you a creepy blonde mustache.</strong></li>
<p>Again, help a sister out. I have a pretty sizable overbite and never got braces because, “meh, they look fine.” There’s no way my family was shelling out cash to deal with my Magnum P.I. situation.  I took matters into my own hands on a tip from <em>Young and Modern</em> (<em>YM</em>) magazine and I sported a blonde ‘stache that perfectly matched my jet black hair for an embarrassing portion of my existence on this planet.</p>
<li><strong>That conditioner is a thing and so is social conditioning.</strong></li>
<p>When I was a little kid, my hair was pretty fun. My dad would squish a lot of shampoo into it and give me a very impressive Ed Grimley hairdo.  Less fun was the brushing and the styling of the hair, as you see, my dad didn’t know that conditioner existed. Once the old chap figured that one out, the tangles were less tangly and the brushing was more manageable. The ponytails, well, they still were a little tight, pulling my eyes sideways on more than a few occasions, but as Dad would say, “Pain is beauty, beauty pain.”  </p>
<p>Even though he was trying to collect my hair into a quirky side-pigtail just like his favorite female college basketball player, even though he was wearing a pro-woman t-shirt from a feminist rally on the day I was born, even though he was breaking all kinds of gender norms by being my mom AND my dad, there’s still that pesky conditioner that can get in our eyes and in my experience, it’s not the tearless kind.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as a nonfiction writer, I’ve already managed to lie to you before I even start. Quit cooking, start reading is not quite true &#8212; I pretty much never stop reading. Not to eat, brush my teeth, not even when cleaning the kitchen or taking a walk. I read my way through the winter hibernation and through the summer vacations. Whenever I fly, I carry 2-3 books on the plane with me because I’m too cheap for an e-reader and because I’m likely to get through at least two. The back problems are totally worth it.</p>
<p>One of my professors sent me the reading list for my fall literature class ahead of time so that we can go ahead and get started. A cooler person than me might have been dismayed, but it made me thrilled to start school. Partly, I was psyched because I’d already read some of the things on the list, which made me feel educated as hell. And that meant I could reread them, actually remember them, and maybe think of some smart shit to say ahead of time in class. (But not too many smart things &#8212; no one wants to be THAT girl, and I don’t want to be shunned at the after-class happy hour.) I’ve already started rereading Nabokov’s <em>Lolita</em>, and have been keeping a list of the beautiful and inventive language he uses so that I can try to learn something while I limp along in my novicehood.</p>
<p>For example: “. . . a poplar playing its liquid shadows all over the local Honor Roll” (p. 137); the backyard with “apple-green light” (p. 31); Lolita with “all four limbs starfished” across the chair (p. 174). Oh dear, I got too Englishy. But if you can’t appreciate the gorgeous prose, then I probably can’t appreciate you. I’m also excited to reread Raymond Carver’s short stories “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” and “Beginners.”</p>
<p>I expect to probably be cooking much less when I’m in school, and writing to you about the best ways to jazz up rice and beans, writing a treatise on the various forms of caffeine, or on the best way to discreetly drink wine during workshop. But before I do all of that, I’m headed back to Michigan with my dad’s side of the family and Charlie to go up north to one of my most favorite places.</p>

<p>We all spend a ton of time reading up there, moving from the hammock to the dock, to the pontoon, to a lawn chair, and back to the hammock again. My dad reads exactly one book a year. He always reads it up north, and it’s always about music. Last year I let him borrow my copy of Steve Almond’s book <em>Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life</em>, with its companion playlist. The year before that, he read Keith Richards’s <em>Life</em>, and read aloud anecdotes about prostitutes and drug cocktails. The year before that, it was Alice Cooper’s book <em>Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roller&#8217;s 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict</em> (which is actually pretty hilarious).</p>
<p>For me, I found a used book at the lovely <a href="http://www.greenapplebooks.com/" target="_blank">Green Apple Books</a> called <em>Not for Bread Alone: Writers on Food, Wine, and the Art of Eating</em>, edited by Daniel Halpern. It’s a collection of food writing from well-known writers, including Wendell Berry, Charles Simic, Joyce Carol Oates, and Francine Prose, among others. Before I get started with classes and get buried under class readings, I’m bringing that one up north, along with Julia Child’s <em>My Life in France</em>, which was given to me as a gift and I MUST READ before I lose all steam.</p>
<p>Reading while lying in the sun and/or eating is one of the things I enjoy most. I wish you all a happy summer, and happy reading!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can’t know grief until you experience grief.  Its pain is ineffable. It socks your body and mind and ruins all sense of reason, meaning. Anything you’ve believed or held true becomes subject to question when someone you care for passes away because something impossibly ridiculous has happened &#8212; a living breathing someone gives up the spark of life and enters a world of objects. Voice, heart, soul, mind, touch. . . all removed from personhood.  Unmagicked into a thing, a someone becomes corpse, becomes ash, becomes not. As death and grief are universals that rip at the fabric of human understanding, of course this subject matter has inspired much in the way of the arts. Though I’ve been moved by many a film and story, I reserve this space to discuss a text that maybe you won’t happen upon on the bestsellers case at your bookstore, or hear about from a friend. Anne Carson’s book/assemblage <em>Nox</em> (2010) has affected me deeply as it so closely and strangely performs and researches the reaches of grief through its remarkable structure, art, truth and tone.  This odd text is worth seeking, finding, discovering and revisiting again and again.</p>
<p>Carson lost her brother twice. A kind of shade in life, he lived apart from his family. Estranged for long periods of time, he kept little contact with his sister. He’d pass along snippets of information by post &#8212; his envelopes acting as clues to his whereabouts overseas. He was a brother, blood, but he existed and didn’t.  His death gave his absence a new permanence and the author was left with the odd practice of learning to grieve for a shade &#8212; giving up he who was already a ghost.  <em>Nox</em> could be interpreted as her attempt of reconfiguring him, erecting a monument, seeking her brother, seeking peace. In making her piece, Carson creates a solid, material presence in the face of loss. It commemorates, elegizes, and yearns for him. Both heartrending and comforting, the text exposes her wounds, but also creates a space for commiseration through the making-public, the opening out of her pain to a world of others floating in the same limbo of emotions.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9953" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/06/unpacking-loss-unpacking-nox/nox1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg" data-orig-size="610,406" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Nox1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=610" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=640" alt="Nox" title="Nox1"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9953" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg 610w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nox1.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /></p>
<p>Paradoxically apt then, <em>Nox</em> is a book that is not one.  A grey hardcover case, something like a pencil or cigar box, houses one long folded sheet, an accordion of pictures, pasted-in letters, hand-scribbled and typewritten text. This unexpected book-form embodies a different kind of connectivity between the reader and what is written. With its layered folds the construction of the accordion suggests a different relationship between story and its experienced temporality. Before we’ve even read the first line, Carson forces us to sensually read and feel the text, to understand with fingers and eyes &#8212; we read without words.  We must open the box, find its secret. Lift the heft of the zigzagging page, careful not to spill it.  We do not merely start reading, but are offered an encounter. Photocopied pages from books and articles, well-worn and folded notes, dog-eared photographs and the visual echoes of writing (a pencil pressed into a page too hard) all lend themselves to the creation of authenticity, the personal, while also expressing the lack that inevitably surrounds these traces—these things only lead back, but do not (re)capture.</p>
<p>An academic and poet, Carson leans on poetry, history, and etymology to answer her questions and fill grief’s emptiness.  Her questions range from the intimately personal (Who was my brother? To me?) to the generalizable or philosophical (How have people written of loss historically? How do the words and practices of the past shape who we are? How we grieve and how we feel?).  She covers the gamut examining historical texts from the ancient Greeks to historical texts from her family’s archive.  Placing these works side by side suggests their similarity as practices of collection, keeping, and knowing, that ultimately cannot offer <em>enough</em> truth or consolation in the face of a death’s void.  Carson records her brother’s life (or more his death?) like a history or legend.  She makes it akin to her precious academic artifacts perhaps hoping to rub more epic meaning on the ordinariness of her loss. Or, perhaps in this move, she stresses the power of context &#8212; the intimate experiences of “my life” are felt as mythic in proportion. She then invites us into this scrapbook of her personal tragedy &#8212; asks us to place it beside Oedipus and Antigone, Romeo, Hamlet.</p>
<p>Carson reminds us that our lives &#8212; even as we live them daily, solidly, in what we deem “reality” &#8212; are made up of things that are only close to us, or pretend to be us. We compose ourselves through the stories we remember, the stories we choose to tell and not tell, archives we endorse or simply leave behind.  Carson tries to re-member her brother through or as an object &#8212; the writing, the book.  He is brought together in pieces like Osiris, reformed, but the product is never satisfactory. Always product, never brother. A collection of scraps and fragments, this text, and perhaps all our histories, form poetic statements that yearn for context, detail and connection, but they also stand alone as particularly resonant poetic moments of open-endedness &#8212; fragments that can only create the feelings/meanings they create because of their inherent disconnection.</p>
<p>I can’t say that writing/building/making this text was a salve of some kind to its maker. I don’t know if it brought relief or consolation or even if consolation is at all ever possible. I can say however that the reading and experiencing of Carson’s <em>Nox</em> is the closest thing I’ve found to someone saying “I know how you feel. I’ve been there. I am there,” while also being the closest I’ve felt to actually believing that statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s strange to string up Christmas lights around a window framing palm trees and sunshine, instead of cloudy skies and snow. Listening to Christmas music on Pandora just felt like a sham. I wonder how parents in San Francisco justify Santa’s sleigh. There’s nothing for his runners to skate over in California but fresh asphalt and no woods in which grandma gets run over. Santa would have to whip his reindeer through Golden Gate Park and mow down dispassionate hipsters instead.</p>
<p>It’s just started to get chilly enough at night to leave frost in the morning, so I decided to celebrate my lack of seasonal affective disorder by making my mother’s homemade chicken and dumplings soup. my family normally spends Christmas Eve at my grandparents’ house, where my grandma cooks three different pots of soup (chicken noodle, chili, and clam chowder). We fill up on crackers and cheese and vegetables beforehand, but we eat two bowls of soup anyway. My grandfather is doing well, but he’s still recovering from surgery and needs to rest, so we’re giving my grandmother a break.</p>
<p>Instead, I wanted to create my own mini-Christmas. If chicken soup cures your sickness, chicken and dumplings soup is the effing elixir of youth. Not only do you have the warm broth and spices, but you have the soft, chewy dumplings. I’d prescribe this for most illnesses—heart, mind, body, whatever.</p>
<p>There’s no link to send you because this is a recipe I actually have written down on a card, in my mother’s handwriting, ending with the word “Yummm!” and a smiley face. I’d share it with you, but I don’t have my mom’s permission and frankly I’d like to keep it to myself. I’ll be coy with the details instead. This will be my only Grinchy moment, I promise.</p>
<p>First, I chopped up chicken, broccoli, carrots, and celery, and added them to a broth with cream of celery soup, some cloves and bay leaves.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was a little disappointed in the simplicity of the recipe. I’ve never watched my mother cook it, but I assumed she threw a bunch of ingredients together—a pinch of this and that, and it somehow came out perfect. Maybe this is part of getting older and realizing that your parents are actually people, but instead of thinking about it too hard, I put a lid on the broth to simmer.</p>
<p>I measured all the ingredients for the dumplings and stirred them into a bowl, then reread the recipe. I was supposed to have mixed the dry ingredients, then added the liquid ones. As usual, I immediately assumed the recipe would be a disaster and went about huffily mixing the dough, though I wondered what was even the POINT, now that it was ruined.</p>

<p>Next, the recipe told me to drop the dumplings into the spoon by the tablespoonful. I’d never learned the physics of dumplings, but I’d assumed they would drop in doughy little balls to the bottom of the pot. Not so. All the dumplings floated on the surface of the broth like Michigan’s winter cloud cover. I couldn’t even see the broth. How were they going to cook if they weren’t even sitting in the broth?</p>

<p>At this point, I wanted to call my mom and cry a little bit over my dumplings and make her promise me lots of Christmas chocolate in my stocking, but it was 11 p.m. in Michigan. After keeping an eye on the expanding dumplings for ten minutes, I turned the heat down, smushed them down with the pot lid, and let it cook.</p>

<p>After only a few minutes, I heard a sizzle from the stovetop, meaning the pot had boiled over. I love having an electric stove for all reasons but this—as soon as you spill something, it burns to a crisp on the hot surface and starts smoking and smelling all sorts of terrible. Even with my slight phobia of burning things, I wasn’t entirely surprised. What more was to be expected from doomed dumplings? I switched burners, turned on the fan, and waited a few more minutes.</p>

<p>Somehow, the dumplings cooked. Those that had been pushed to the bottom of the pan were a little doughier, those at the top were fluffy. I couldn’t imagine how that had happened, when most of the dumplings seemed to be above the broth’s surface, but I didn’t question it and ladled out two bowls. As a kid, I used to fill my bowl with more dumplings than soup, and my mom’s recipe had the ideal ratio, with a bite of dumpling for every spoonful. As usual, if I listen to my mom, everything will turn out okay.</p>
<p>I’m writing this from a plane, watching the red rock terrain change to snowy Rocky Mountain peaks, which shrink into plains where Santa would have no sleigh problems. I wish you warmth and a full belly for the holidays and the new year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My grandfather wouldn&#8217;t eat garlic. While my family has produced a number of picky eaters, I don&#8217;t normally think of my grandfather as having been one of them. I don&#8217;t remember running into many things that he wouldn&#8217;t eat, although that may be been one of the privileges of eating mostly at one&#8217;s own house and being choosy about where one eats out. I ate a lot of good food with my grandfather, but no garlic.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast to the food I eat with my wife&#8217;s Italian family. When I was a child, pasta sauce was something that came from a jar and was poured over ground beef and noodles. My wife makes her own sauce, sometimes with fresh tomatoes and sometimes with canned, but always, always with fresh garlic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being a picky eater and being a food snob. I&#8217;d like to suggest that in the right hands garlic can sometimes bridge the two. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to do garlic bread. Even a quick search turns up recipes from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Rachel Ray</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/zesty-roasted-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Paula Deen</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Ina Garten</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/herbed-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Tyler Florence</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/guy-fieri/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Guy Fieri</a>, <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-2734" target="_blank">Bon Appétit</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-106583" target="_blank">Gourmet</a></em>. A lot of these involve quantities of cheese, herbs, tomatoes, or some combination of the above, and they&#8217;re all fine.</p>
<p>But as much as I love fresh garlic &#8212; and I do &#8212; garlic powder makes a perfectly good garlic bread. Take any loaf of unsliced crusty bread and cut it in half. Spread butter over both halves. Sprinkle garlic powder on the butter &#8212; a little goes a long way &#8212; and toast both halves under the broiler just until it starts to brown. Share if necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not anything that I would eaten in my grandfather&#8217;s house, but I think of him every time I eat it.</p>
