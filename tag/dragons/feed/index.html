										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robin McKinley&#8217;s <em>Dragonhaven</em> is set in Smokehill National Park somewhere out west, where the major draw is a population of <em>Draco australiensis</em> &#8212;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop there.</p>
<p>I love this novel about a national park with dragons, which is also a meditation on parenting, communication, and memory. The premise alone was enough to sell me on this 2007 novel by the author of a dozen or so smart, humane, chatty fantasy novels, but I&#8217;ll give you a little more detail to explain why I love it so much.</p>
<p>Jake Mendoza is the teenage son of the director of the dragon studies institute at Smokehill, a chronically underfunded, understaffed dragon reserve. Almost no one sees the dragons on the millions of acres of parkland; Smokehill rangers track dragon population by counting the casualties among wild sheep, deer, and bison. Smokehill also has a very strange dragon-proof (and more importantly, poacher-proof) fence. Jake and his father are both devastated by the death of Jake&#8217;s mother three years before on a dragon study sabbatical in Kenya (the world&#8217;s only preserves for the endangered dragons are at Smokehill, in Kenya, and in Australia, to which dragons are native. The detail in <em>Dragonhaven</em> on the rediscovery and near-extinction of dragons and the politics of protecting enormous, flying, endangered species is right on.)</p>
<p>The following happens in the first 50 pages of the book, so don&#8217;t fear spoilers. Jake is belatedly allowed to do his first solo hike in the park and stumbles upon a dragon. It&#8217;s not just a dragon, which he has never seen up close before, but a dragon who has just given birth, which no one in the records has ever seen. And not only that, the dragon is dying, shot by a poacher. These are all unthinkably strange things, but Jake is focused only on the surviving baby dragon, who he saves and tries to raise, despite knowing &#8212; because of that complicated legislative picture &#8212; that it&#8217;s illegal to save the life of a dragon.</p>
<p>The relationship between Jake and Lois the baby dragon and the serious parenting crash course Jake has to undertake (what do you feed a baby dragon and how do you keep it from burning you? How can you do anything else when she needs feeding every half hour?) is compelling and all-consuming and feels true. The book is structured as a memoir Jake is writing to explain the events at Smokehill to a national audience, and he explains that he was so short of sleep while raising Lois that some of those years were a blur. Jake&#8217;s voice really does feel like a teenager&#8217;s voice and it sells you on the story and its required suspensions of disbelief because you trust that it happened the way Jake said it, even if he didn&#8217;t understand the larger political ramifications.</p>
<p>There are excellent small observations: because it seems absurd to Jake to say “Good dragon, Lois” like he was talking to a dog, he says “Hot stuff, Lois!” as a praise-phrase. And it&#8217;s exactly right that interspecies telepathy would cause terrible headaches.</p>
<p>If the book had a different cover I could see it being sold as a thrilling adventure novel, or as a touching book about parents and children. As it is, look for it in the young adult section of your bookstore or library.</p>
