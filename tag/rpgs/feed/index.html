										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first stood in front of the Raging Thrak Inn when I was twelve. The game was still called <em>Gemstone III</em>, and no one in the house was allowed to use the phone when I played, lest I get “booted.” I was a different character then. I quit playing when I was fourteen, then joined again in my mid-twenties. Things change in a decade. The inn hasn’t changed much, which is a comfort.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <em>Gemstone III</em> while exploring AOL’s games section. That was back in the days when AOL presented their online content in curated sections, only one of which was labeled the “world wide web.” Take a drive on that information superhighway, and it was nothing but GeoCities and Angelfire pages for miles. At least it seemed that way. I didn’t much care for it. </p>
<p>Games I could always get behind, though, and soon enough I found myself in <em>Gemstone</em>’s character creator. After getting over the initial shock of seeing nothing but scrolling text on my screen (this was a video game?), I chose my race, profession, physical characteristics, and name. I also placed a limited number of training points into various stats and skills without having any idea of what I was doing. Soon enough, I was thrust into the high fantasy world of Elanthia, dressed in rags and standing in an alley in a frontier town called Wehnimer’s Landing. </p>
<p>Eventually I made my way to the town square, which was buzzing with activity. There were other people here, real people, and they were healing each other, raising the dead, pickpocketing, talking, laughing, passing through. The text scrolling by so quickly was dizzying.</p>

<p>Town Square Central remains a hub of activity today. There’s no better place to drag a dead body, I can tell you that much. It’s still the best place to find both a healer and a cleric on short notice.</p>
<p>Here in <em>Gemstone IV</em>, I step into the Raging Thrak Inn’s barroom, then move west to the trophy room. With some trepidation, I move behind a non-descript thrak hide curtain.</p>
<p>Thank the Arkati he’s still here.</p>
<p>A thrak is a monster in the game, but the Raging Thrak is a human warrior gone to seed, and if a young player seeks him out, both experience and wisdom can be gained from the meeting.</p>
<p>He surprises me by launching into his spiel:</p>
<p>“Well, now,” he starts off, “it seems we have another fresh young face right off the turnip farms come to town to be a hero. Bein&#8217; a hero ain&#8217;t all it&#8217;s cracked up to be some days, but most of the time it&#8217;s pretty excitin&#8217;. Now, listen up and I&#8217;ll give ya the benefit of my many years of wisdom, gleaned from the farthest corners of the lands and the brightest and best of the heroes of the past.”</p>
<p>I’m level 17, three trains away from titling. I’m a long way from the turnip farms, Mr. Thrak, sir. Nonetheless, I sit and listen to his advice, for nostalgia’s sake. Except I’m fairly sure you can’t have this meeting more than once. It’s a tutorial for new players. Thrak gives several paragraphs of information on game mechanics and etiquette, and quizzes you afterwards. You gain a modest amount of experience points if answer the questions correctly. Could it be I never visited the Thrak with my current character?</p>
<p>Sure enough, here’s the test. I pass with flying colors.</p>

<p>Ha! Level 18! So I suppose I didn’t come to see him this time. I laugh, in real life and in the game, like this:</p>
<p>&gt;laugh<br />
You laugh out loud!<br />
&gt;</p>
<p>I get a little misty in real life. I play it cool in the game. </p>
<p>It’s strange, the things that cause you to look back. Listening to the old warrior tell me to avoid using all caps or multiple exclamation marks when speaking to other players sends me shooting back through time to the age of wearing cutoffs, and climbing trees, and otter pops, and riding bikes. An age of cops and robbers, and my neighbor’s swing set, and my other neighbor’s friendly mutt dog. </p>
<p>An age where this:</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>Meant “What’s next?”</p>
<p>The age of my first MUD. My first RPG, for that matter. My first, but certainly not last, text-based game. Perhaps my first experience feeling emotion while playing a video game. Perhaps <em>Gemstone</em> is a reason I write about video games. Strike that “perhaps.” It’s most definitely a reason. It taught me how to type, at the very least.  </p>
<p>To say writing about video games here at <em>The Idler</em> was an honor and a pleasure would be an understatement. It’s only been a couple of months, but the brightest flames burn quickest, they say. Even more of a pleasure was reading the works of my fellow Idlers. I still have much of the archives to comb through. I can’t wait to look back.</p>
<p>But let’s all remember to look forward, too. Here, a parting gift:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/17/cave-story-jumping-into-story/">Last week</a>, I promised that this week&#8217;s post would be about narrative in <em>Cave Story</em>, but I&#8217;m going to put that off a bit, in part because the game is doing a great job of doling out the story bit by bit in ways that are keeping me interested as a player, and making me feel that I&#8217;m not really going to be able to say anything substantial until I can talk about the beginning, middle, and the end all at once. Right now, I know that I&#8217;m a robot left over from a war 10 years ago in which people attacked an island and its Mimiga inhabitants. Backed into a corner, the Mimiga ate certain red flowers, and became vicious fighting machines. Now, there are few Mimiga and fewer robots, an evil doctor who wants to exploit the Mimiga, and a good professor who wants to stop him. The whys and wherefores are still up in the air, but it&#8217;s becoming clear that everyone knows everyone else. Well, except for me, that is.</p>
<p>So instead I&#8217;d like to continue to talk about the ways in which the game mixes RPG and 2D platformer mechanics &#8212; primarily how a strikingly simple design choice serves to open up what would otherwise be a fairly linear world. In the 8-bit platforming world which is my (admittedly outdated) primary point of reference, games largely ask the player to navigate in one direction, often from left to right. The basic model would be, of course, <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/11/18/mario-gets-old/">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, which doesn&#8217;t even let you backtrack once the screen has scrolled to the right, but even when games like <em>Castlevania</em> include vertical and right-to-left elements in their level design, there&#8217;s usually a specific forward direction at any given time, and it&#8217;s rare for a game to ask you to retrace your steps.</p>
<p>This might be one of the most brilliant components of the 2D platform game &#8212; particularly in systems with severe technical limitations (like an 8-bit console), the 2D platform game architecture creates a perpetual feeling of active progress. The game, when played, is in constant motion, and that motion is always directed toward a specific end. Thus, as long as the player is in motion, they can be confident that they&#8217;ll eventually reach the goal. The game may include rewards for exploration &#8212; hidden power-ups, warp zones, or bonus areas &#8212; but even a new player can just keep moving forward and progress through the game.</p>
<p><em>Cave Story</em>, on the other hand, pushes the player back and forth within a level like no other 2D platformer I&#8217;ve ever played. I&#8217;ve created a map below of the path I followed to complete the Bushlands level (known in some versions of the game as the Grasslands). [Click on the map for a larger version.]</p>
<p><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="9966" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/23/cave-story-the-zig-zag-world/grasslandmap6/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg" data-orig-size="2164,920" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="grasslandmap6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=640&#038;h=272" alt="back and forth" title="grasslandmap6" width="640" height="272" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9966" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=640&amp;h=272 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=544 1280w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=150&amp;h=64 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=300&amp;h=128 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=768&amp;h=327 768w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/grasslandmap61.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=435 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note that in addition to all of the smaller back-and-forths, the game requires the player to return to the very beginning of the level <em>at least three times</em>. While the level largely follows a progressive back-and-forth &#8212; that is, you could basically divide the level in half, and the player is required to thoroughly explore the first half, and then can largely move on to thoroughly explore the second half &#8212; but then the game violates this neat division when it makes the player return to the beginning to fetch charcoal as a bomb component.</p>
<p>The effect of all this, at least in my play, was to make the area much more of a map (in RPG terms) than a level (in 2D platformer terms). Rather than simply being able to progress (and then return to the teleporter after completing the level), I had to continue to re-explore, and continue to converse with non-player characters (NPCs), just like returning to a town after defeating a major monster, accomplishing a specific goal, or acquiring new items in an RPG. In fact, the player&#8217;s relationships with NPCs in Cave Story are more dynamic than in many 40-hour RPGs I&#8217;ve played.</p>
<p>And, in all honesty, <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> could learn a thing or two from <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s level design. (Too often, running around in <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> is like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> without the jumping. Ugh.)</p>
<p>So, story next week, I promise, and I&#8217;m hoping to look back on how the robot works as a blank slate/player identification character compared to <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/15/earthbound-taking-dads-advice/">Ness from <em>EarthBound</em></a>. (My initial take is that the robot works a lot better, but I need to do some noodling as to why and how.)</p>
<p>Thus far, we know that <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/22/cave-story-power-up/">Daniel is enthusiastic about <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s power-ups</a>, and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/16/cave-story-platform-mechanics/">Kevin is a bit skeptical about the jumping mechanics</a> (which is a pretty big problem for a platformer). I&#8217;m curious to know, though, on the whole how is the game working for the two of you? What genre would you cram it into? What, as you head towards the end, would it take to make or break the game for you?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe that we wrap up next week! Well, onward! (And maybe back again.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It took longer than I expected (I blame Thanksgiving, and <a title="Stuff to watch!" href="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/30/im-thankful-for/"><em>Mysterious Cities of Gold</em></a> being on Netflix Watch Instant), but I finished playing through <em>EarthBound</em> over the weekend. This was only my second time completing the entire game, and the first time since I was in my early-mid-lower-teens.</p>
<p>Now, the big question: <em><del>When will ALF get a new show?</del> What did I think of EarthBound this time around?</em></p>
<p>First, let’s compare to my <a title="Geek Speak – Final Fantasy VII Revisited part 1" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2010/12/23/geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-1/"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> play through</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed a lot more subtext and thematic elements while playing <em>FFVII</em> as an adult, which is why I think the game still holds up very well. The plot, while a tad complicated, is filled with themes which still ring strong in 2011: <a title="Yep." href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/01/20/geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-4/&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=lm3dTojUIcLpgQelnJWFBg&amp;ved=0CAUQFjAA&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGUb9kOYiP4rbJd5_oL8sKBXVumg">availability of natural resources</a>, <a title="Terror!" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-2/">terrorism</a>, powerful corporations running the world, and yes, even <a title="Oh, boy. " href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-3/">cross-dressing</a>.</p>
<p>But what of <em>EarthBound</em>? Did I notice more subtext and themes? Not really, save for the final battle (I will elaborate below). Something I <strong>did</strong> notice this time around, were aspects of the game which drove me bonkers:</p>
<p><strong>No multiple save slots.</strong> Yes, you can have different “games,” but you cannot save the same game in a different slot, allowing you to backtrack if you screw up.</p>
<p><strong>The static battle screen.</strong> While I am usually a fan of simplicity, the battle screens in EarthBound were as visually engaging as a postage stamp (although I did enjoy the character design and names). Battles became a chore, and by extension, so did the game.</p>
<p><strong>The item system.</strong> <em>Sweet Batman-on-a-crutch</em>, this was perhaps the <a title="Hated it." href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-7-problems/">most infuriating aspect of the game</a>. I spent too much time juggling items between characters and Escargo Express, the “storage locker” business.</p>
<p><strong>The very linear, hand-holding, deus ex machina-filled plot</strong>. The game goes out of its way to tell you <a title="You should go in that room. Really, go ahead. I will wait here. That room looks important." href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-8go-there-do-that /">where you go and what you should do</a>.</p>
<p>I could nitpick <em>EarthBound</em> apart for another thousand words, but I still enjoy the game. I enjoy <em>EarthBound</em> because it is so different &#8212; it is not the typical role-playing game of that era (the early-mid-1990s).</p>
<p>Now, on to the final battle. <strong>Here be Spoilers.</strong></p>
<h3>Spoilers Start Here</h3>
<p>In order for the gang to battle Giygas, they must travel back in time &#8212; but, the time machine cannot send back living tissue (the opposite of <em>The Terminator</em>). What’s a hero to do?</p>
<p>Dr. Andonuts transfers the “minds” of the heroes to robots, which are sent back in time. This is done by way of a scene of each character laying down with their eyes closed, while sounds of chainsaws, drills and hammers play in the background. Creepy.</p>
<p>Speaking of creepy, <a title="read at own risk" href="http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Games/Mother2/The-Giygas-Fetus-theory">theories abound</a> that the final battle against Giygas is some sort of thinly veiled abortion: You go back in time, before Giygas is a threat (fetus), enter a cave (vagina), travel up a fleshy path to the Devil’s Machine (uterus/cervix) and kill him &#8212; with metal, robots. <em>Ahem</em>. You can watch for yourself, <a title="Oh, boy." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gbG_gzgyJI">here</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, you do go back in time and kill Giygas when he is weaker &#8212; not unlike the plot to kill John Connor’s mother before he is born in <em>Terminator</em> (called “retroactive abortion” in the film). I found <a title="Eep." href="http://forum.valinor.com.br/attachment.php?attachmentid=17753&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1210564833">an image online</a> which points out a fetus-like image later in the battle, and connects the dots of the theory. Part of this theory also suggests Giygas is only attacking Ness and the others in defense, and he was not evil during the fight (he was just a fetus, or at least not evil &#8216;yet&#8217;).</p>
<p><strong>Do I buy into this theory?</strong> Not really. I am a firm believer in &#8220;if you go looking for something, you can find it.&#8221; I once wrote a (terrible) film theory paper on how <em>The Breakfast Club</em> represented the American Revolution, and another (even worse) on how <em>Gremlins</em> can be seen as an allegory for Western Capitalism run amok (I can lay on the BS when needed, as you have learned by now) .</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>While <em>EarthBound</em> can be frustrating, it is none the less a very original, genre breaking RPG. Yes, playing became more of a chore toward the end, but I am glad I finished. Despite the game&#8217;s annoyances, I am happy I took the time to replay this quirky Super Nintendo classic &#8212; because, <a title="Geek Speak – Earthbound Revisited, Part One: All My Friends are in There" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/09/13/geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-pt-1/">all of my friends are in there</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will say this about <em>EarthBound</em>, it has no shortage of curveballs and it does take you to some strange locations. In a different role-playing game (RPG), some of the locations may not stand out so much, but given the &#8220;suburban&#8221; look and feel of most of the game, the more &#8220;unique&#8221; locales can be filed under <em>What the French Toast</em>?</p>
<p>After leaving the desert, via a yellow submarine (yes), the party comes to a swamp area known as The Deep Darkness.</p>
<p>Now, if the party was one of leather-clad warriors wielding insanely huge swords, then Deep Darkness would not stand out. But, the party in <em>EarthBound</em> is one of suburban kids with baseball bats and frying pans. In this case, trudging through a swamp, beating up baddies with said bats and pans draws attention to the fact this is quirky game and nearly knocks the player out of the game.</p>
<p>You’re thinking <del>“Why am I reading this?&#8221;</del> &#8220;What?”</p>
<p>Let me explain. Or at least try.</p>
<p>The other RPGs released for Super Nintendo around the time of <em>EarthBound</em> had more of a fantasy look (<em>Final Fantasy II</em> and <em>III</em>, <em>Secret of Mana</em>, <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, etc). In such a setting, a dark swamp filled with strange creatures fits &#8212; we expect such a thing, like a spooky dungeon or a strange forest. Such settings are &#8220;stock characters&#8221; for RPGs because of the &#8220;fantasy&#8221; setting in which they (usually) take place.</p>
<p>But, when you throw a stock setting like Deep Darkness into a game like <em>EarthBound</em>, it sticks out. Why? Because the characters are different than those in other RPGs of the time.</p>
<p>For example, Crono and the gang fighting their way through a vine-filled, snake-infested swamp fits in <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, because they complement each other. Whereas in <em>EarthBound</em>, the characters are such a contrast to the setting, it nearly knocks the player out of the game. Crono, a talking frog, and a lonely robot traveling through a poor man’s <a title="Yoda's hood." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagobah">Dagobah</a>? Sure. Gamers buy it. Three suburban teens armed with household items beating up crocodiles? Uhh.</p>
<p>This is why <em>EarthBound</em> is a “love it or hate it” game &#8212; it breaks molds and plays with what the player expects from a 1990s RPG.</p>
<p>Is this a bad thing? No. <em>EarthBound</em> is unique, which is why it has legions of fans. If we look at the game as a satire of other RPGs of the time, then all of this makes sense.</p>
<p>I think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am currently in the Egypt-themed country of Scaraba, and the story gets pretty interesting. By which I mean, strange. No surprise there, right?</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Scaraba, I came upon an NPC on the edge of town and he informed me, “The fat kid did his business over there.” Sure enough, on the sand there are a pair of black pixels. Upon inspecting the pixels, the game says (more or less) “Pokey’s stink still hangs in the air.”</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>A defecation joke in a Super Nintendo Game? <em>Dang</em>.</p>
<p>And this was not even the strangest part of Scaraba. Really. <a title="Details" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeon_Man#Dungeon_Man">Dungeon Man</a> is perhaps the strangest (but in a cool way). Dungeon Man is, according to the game, “the first fusion of Man and Dungeon.”</p>
<p>Yes, Dungeon Man is <em>a giant walking dungeon</em>. He also joins the party (Poo left for a bit to learn Starstorm). This is sort of like if <a title="wiki" href="http://www.tfu.info/1986/Autobot/Metroplex/metroplex.htm">Metroplex</a> from <em>The Transformers</em> joined the party. I should add, Dungeon Man started out as a very human dungeon designer by the name of Brick Road. Jeff’s father, Dr. Andonuts, made the fusion of Man and Dungeon possible. Again, this foreshadows later events in the game.</p>
<p>Oh, and Dungeon Man also has folks living inside, including a Hospital (where you can heal your party). This reminds me of the <em>Futurama</em> episode where Fry becomes infested with <a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasites_Lost">intelligent space worms</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I added the remaining player character to my party this week: <a title="Wiki" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Poo">Poo</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, that is his name. I read an article where the writer wondered why his Japanese name was not translated as Pu, but given the quirkiness of the game, along with the inclusion of characters like Master Barf, Poo fits.</p>
<p>Poo, like Ness and Paula, can use PSI powers. He is also rather strong, which makes him a great secondary fighter (after Ness).</p>
<p>Since Poo started at out at level 15, and the rest of my party was pushing 50, I had to do a bit of level grinding. That’s always fun. Nothing I enjoy more than an hour spent beating up enemies to boost stats. /snark</p>
<p>Level grinding is something I never really thought about, or spent time on, when I originally played <em>EarthBound</em> as a teen. My original save file is still on the cartridge (and I&#8217;m playing on my original Super Nintendo), and I beat the game with Ness at level 59. Currently, I have Ness at level 53 and there is plenty of game left.</p>
<p>But, back to Poo. The prince is not without his own quirks (yes, he is a prince, but sadly not the musician. Image <em>that</em> game).  Mainly, only certain foods will give Poo more than six or so HP. The player’s guide presents this as some sort of commentary on the Standard American Diet (lots of meat, junk food), as Poo is from a country where everyone lives on water and rice gruel.</p>
<p>To sum up, feeding Poo a burger is a waste of money. He will only recover a few HP. So yes, we have a video game character with a particular diet. In some ways, this is a rather ingenious feature. But, in many ways, it is rather annoying. The easiest trick is to just load up on items which restore PP (the game’s version of magic points) and use Lifeup instead of items.</p>
<p>However, I need to back up and mention how the game introduces Poo. Ness and the party consume a Magic Cake in Summers, which induces a psychedelic freak-out-state. The game shifts control to Poo, who is far away in another country. And this is not the first time the game has the characters consume mind-altering foodstuffs either.</p>
<p>Remember the coffee with <a title="Geek Speak – EarthBound Revisited, pt. 5: They Call Me Mr. Saturn" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/10/18/geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-pt-5-they-call-me-mr-saturn/">Mr. Saturn</a>?</p>
<p>Being familiar with the later parts of the game, I now think these two experiences (the coffee, the Magic Cake) foreshadow some of the stranger events to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not totally ready to write off <em>EarthBound</em>. There are, after all, some good things to say about the game. The enemy design is unusual and imaginative, even (or especially) for a genre that spends a lot of time on its bestiaries. I love bumping into tripped-out blue-skinned people who &#8220;turn back to normal&#8221; at the end of a fight. I love that Territorial Oaks are hardcore, and that while they take a chunk out of you when they self-immolate, it&#8217;s far worse if you have a teddy bear, because you&#8217;ll survive, but the teddy bear won&#8217;t. I love that you can walk around with a teddy bear to attract enemy attacks!</p>
<p>And I especially love the boss fights, which are often unexpected in a deeply refreshing way. You can run into a boss in the middle of a town instead of always having to fight through a huge dungeon, and they have <em>personality</em>. In fact, if there&#8217;s one thing that this game has, it&#8217;s personality. It takes RPG tropes and tweaks them a little. You can&#8217;t take any of the standard RPG mechanics for granted (see Daniel&#8217;s column this week about Poo&#8217;s unique diet), and everything from the battle narration to the save system is just a little offbeat in a really good way.</p>
<p>And yet. For a game with such wonderful personality, the protagonist, Ness, has none at all. There&#8217;s no feeling of an overarching direction. And, worst of all, when I turn off the game, I don&#8217;t think about it. At all. It&#8217;s not until I&#8217;m coming up on another Gamer&#8217;s Club deadline that I remember that I need to put some time in. And, until I turn on the game at least, it feels like such a chore.</p>
<p>In fact, if I think about the game at all, it&#8217;s to try to figure out what it could be possibly missing. Why does it seem to measure up so poorly to its near-contemporaries <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, <em>A Link to the Past</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy III</em> (<em>VI</em>)? Part of it, certainly, is that the graphics and animation are sub-par &#8212; In fact, it&#8217;s not much beyond what I would expect from an NES rather than an SNES title &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient. I played through the original <em>Final Fantasy</em> a few years ago, long, long after its original NES release, and even in its polished Game Boy Advance re-release, the game is no more technically advanced or polished than <em>EarthBound</em>, and it&#8217;s far less unique.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a genuine conundrum, and this, if nothing else, has kept me playing for the past few weeks.</p>
<p>But I think I&#8217;ve figured it out. While Ness&#8217;s lack of personality is in itself far from a deal-breaker &#8212; none of the playable characters in the original <em>Final Fantasy</em> have any personality at all &#8212; and despite the fact that <em>EarthBound</em>&#8216;s designers clearly put a lot of energy into creating the world of the game, the game itself spends no time or energy exploring Ness&#8217;s place in that world, and that&#8217;s making it difficult for me to get invested in playing.</p>
<p>Let me give an example, using the last Gamers&#8217; Club game. In <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, you don&#8217;t just have a quest, or a world to explore, you have a main character, Cloud, who has left one life, as a member of the elite military group SOLDIER, and is trying to start another. Initially, that means working as a mercenary with the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, but the game quickly throws not only Cloud&#8217;s self-conception, but his entire past, memory, and even his birth into question. You, as the player, are trying to save the world, but you&#8217;re also trying to solve a mystery, and your relationships with the supporting characters and villains are critical to that mystery.</p>
<p>In short, everything matters, and it brought me back, even when playing the game felt like homework. (Deadlines are deadlines.)</p>
<p><em>EarthBound</em> isn&#8217;t giving me that, and so, for now, I&#8217;m going to let it fall to the side. It&#8217;s been an interesting experiment, and a fertile imaginative world at an unsettled time in my life. I&#8217;m glad that I gave the game a go, and one day I will come back to it. You know, when I finish reading all those books I&#8217;ve been meaning to read, or after I make it through <em>Indigo Prophecy</em>, or the <em>Ico/Shadow of the Colossus</em> re-release. (Aw, yeah.)</p>
<p>So long, <em>EarthBound</em>. We&#8217;ll meet again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally rescued Paula (for the second time) the other night, and I am glad to have her back in the party. I missed her PSI Powers. But, maybe I missed her extra item slots even more (OK, that sounds kind of dirty).</p>
<p>Last week, I touched on some of the <a title="Geek Speak – EarthBound Revisited, Pt. 7: Problems" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/11/01/geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-7-problems/">heavy handed plot elements</a> in the game, and well, the exposition and hand-holding was piled on again.</p>
<p>I mentioned last week how the game dishes out plot driving items without little or no involvement on the player&#8217;s part (they aren&#8217;t really connected to what the party is doing at the moment).</p>
<p>Case in point, Apple Kid.</p>
<p>Apple Kid randomly calls Ness up to say he has invented X device to help the party do Y. This really sticks out, because he phrases the calls in such a way to suggest he invented the necessary gadget without having any idea of what the party is doing. Coincidence, he has it.</p>
<p>I guess this plays into Apple Kid&#8217;s &#8220;unappreciated genius&#8221; status a bit, but it would probably make for better storytelling if Ness went to Apple Kid for help in the first place and the party had to search for the items to build the gadget.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that &#8220;Apple&#8221; Kid invented a portable phone to help the party is not lost on me. Did <em>EarthBound</em> predict the iPhone? Maybe.  (See: <em>You Can Find Meaning When You Want to Find It</em>.)</p>
<p>What I really noticed this past week was how the NPCs (non-player characters) try really hard to tell Ness where he should go. For example, NPCs will say something like &#8220;Man, that room behind me looks pretty weird. You should go check it out. Go ahead, I&#8217;ll wait here.&#8221;</p>
<p>This grew to annoy me a bit, as the &#8220;go there,&#8221; &#8220;do this&#8221; text came in a flood during and after rescuing Paula.</p>
<p>Then I thought it over a bit. I figured, <em>EarthBound</em> was (more or less) intended for gamers around half my age. When I played this game originally as a teenager, I was &#8220;age appropriate&#8221; and did not notice the spoon-fed plot as much.</p>
<p>Let us (<em>lettuce?</em>) not forget the translation factor. The over-obvious plot (at least the text) could be the result of the English translator. Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>I guess the mantra of <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> is worth noting here:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a show, I should really just relax.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>EarthBound</em> is just a video game. An atypical video game yes, but still a video game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-make-or-break/">last week</a> I said that this was going to be a make or break week for me. Well, I don&#8217;t know that I can say that another couple of hours of play made <em>EarthBound</em> for me, but at least I can say it didn&#8217;t break it either.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a close thing, and while at the moment there&#8217;s (just) enough to keep me going, there are times when the game itself specifically neglects to encourage to to continue playing. Every time you save your game by calling your dad, he asks you if you want to turn the game off, and sounds a bit disappointed if you say that you want to continue playing.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a relic of days before save points, quicksaves, and autosaves, days when getting <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/06/housed/">housed</a> was just part of playing an RPG, days when you would lose an entire term paper when your word processing program crashed.</p>
<p>Days, in other words, best forgotten.</p>
<p>I spent most of this week in Happy Happy, which Daniel wrote about in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/09/27/earthbound-happy-happy/">week 3</a>. (Yeah, I&#8217;m a bit behind. Did I mention that I&#8217;m living in a new state?) Happy Happy is a town run by a cult known as the Happyists, who run around in blue Klu Klux Klan robes and have painted the town, well, blue. Not coincidentally, when you run into hostile townspeople in Twoson, what color are they? Yeah, you got it.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s something sinister about the color blue in this game. We&#8217;ll store that away for future reference.</p>
<p>In Happy Happy, you find a house where a girl named Paula is being held. Pokey sics a couple of cultists on you and runs away. (<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-hokey-pokey/">He apparently shows up later, too.</a>) When you confront the cult&#8217;s leader, a man named Carpainter, he&#8217;s standing in front of a statue of Gygas &#8212; finally! It&#8217;s almost easy to forget that Gygas is supposed to be the big bad in this game, since we haven’t seen any sign of him since Lier X. Agerate showed off the statue he found under his house. (It is, in fact, the same statue in Happy Happy &#8212; Carpainter bought it from Lier.)</p>
<p>When Carpainter is defeated (which was actually pretty easy. I had Ness at level 16, which was apparently perfectly adequate), Pokey shows up and apologizes. Then he yells “psych!” and runs away. Jerk.</p>
<p>Paula, somewhat oddly, starts off at level 1, with strength and hit points (or lack thereof) accordingly, but she catches up quickly, and learns several PSI abilities. She’s still not terribly powerful, but her extra item slots are valuable in and of themselves.</p>
<p>If I had any observations at this point, it that Lilliput Steps is an oddly non-essential area. It&#8217;s where you record the second Sanctuary Song, but there&#8217;s nothing else that you need in the game to progress to the next town. It&#8217;s even geographically removed &#8212; a side area adjacent to Happy Happy &#8212; and when you rescue Paula, she encourages you to return to Twoson as opposed to going after the Sanctuary Song. In all truth, this is probably intended to give you a chance to level Paula up a bit, and for all I know, the game&#8217;s designers do intend for you to come back to Lilliput Steps (a little) later in the game. If Carpainter was an easy boss fight, the Mondo Mole was actually pretty hard. With Ness at level 20 and Paula at level 16, I only just survived.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m making progress! Also, I finished <em>Arkham City</em>, so that&#8217;s not a distraction (read: far better game) anymore. So, onward!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week, my gamer brothers-in-arms, <a title="Gavin's post last week." href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-make-or-break/">Gavin</a> and Andrew, hinted at <em>EarthBound</em> testing their patience. Andrew, bless him, even went so far to title last week&#8217;s post <a title="Andrew's post." href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-i-loathe-this-game/"><em>&#8220;I loathe this game.&#8221;</em></a></p>
<p>However, while I do not plan on giving up, I told the fellas to do whatever they wish. Since this snag came up, it inspired me to weigh in on my feelings about the game overall.</p>
<p>I do not fault Gavin and Andrew for wanting to hang up their controllers. <em>EarthBound</em> can be a challenging game. It is not without its faults. Compared to other classic RPGs on the Super Nintendo, <em>EarthBound</em> is lacking in some areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I hate the item system.</strong> It is a constant source of frustration. Yes, on some level, it adds a bit of &#8220;realism&#8221; to the game: each item takes up a slot, and each character only has so many slots. I suppose I should count my blessings. It could be like the item system in <em>Resident Evil</em>, where you must arrange items like pieces in Tetris to fit inside your &#8220;backpack.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>The battles are visually boring.</strong> Granted, coming to <em>EarthBound</em> after <a title="Final Fantasy VII Revisited" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/category/blog/geek-speak/games/final-fantasy-vii-revisited/"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a> may not have been the best move. While I enjoy the design and names of the enemies (e.g., Annoying Old Party Man, Cute Li&#8217;l UFO), the static sprites and lack of player sprites make battles about as visually engaging as a postage stamp. Compare this to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> or <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, two other classic RPGs for the Super Nintendo (yes, I know the enemies were also static in <em>FFVI</em>, but at least the player characters moved).</li>
<li><strong>Character abilities are somewhat lacking.</strong> Again, I must refer back to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Each of those games featured characters with a wide array of abilities. Yes, Ness and Paula have their PSI attacks, but few, if any, are as interesting as Sabin&#8217;s attacks in <em>FFVI</em>, or X-Strike in <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Jeff is the most lacking of the three (soon to be four, once I get Poo). He cannot use PSI attacks, but he can Spy to learn an enemy&#8217;s weakness. He can also use Bottle Rockets and such, but you can only carry so many due to the item system (see above).</li>
<li><strong>The game play is very linear.</strong> I don&#8217;t always hate linear games. The world opens up a bit once you learn Teleport (which I did recently), but it is nothing like <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> or <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. A point Andrew brought up was, essentially, how the party just goes somewhere and then the game rewards them <a title="Andrew's post." href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/11/earthbound-let%E2%80%99s-roll-another-boulder-up-the-hill-shall-we/">with an item to progress further</a>. I didn&#8217;t really think about this until he pointed it out, but this does happen quite a bit. Apple Kid and others supply the party with items to move the story along, without much (or any) effort on the player&#8217;s part, in such a way that it is almost like a time release Plot Pill.</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, I make these observations as a fan of the game. I still love <em>EarthBound</em>, despite these faults, and I look forward to completing this wacky, quirky adventure. There is no such thing as a perfect video game. Well, except for maybe <a title="Kidding. Ms. Pac-Man." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgertime">BurgerTime</a>.</p>
