Too  much.</p></div> But how to celebrate?  </p>
<p>If I had my way I’d gather and lock all my favorite people into a room and we’d gorge on the tasty insides of Discovery Channel television and snack until we were sick!  But, as I am once again in a new state, and with Husband beating the heat in Russia, and Simon Pegg not returning my calls (what? I said I wanted all my favorite people) I was stuck alone at home, glum, on the brink of an epic quadranscentennial week of shark television.</p>
<p>In order to keep my loneliness at bay and maintain my enthusiasm for my favorite week of the year, I decided I would nevertheless celebrate Shark Week on my own by combining two of my favorite things: Sharks and Food (Is this healthy? This might not be healthy).</p>
<p>In a fit of inspiration (and boredom) I began to flesh out my idea for a Shark Week themed treat.  I didn’t feel like carving up a shark watermelon or actively searching out a precise recipe.  I didn’t have the attention span for that sort of nonsense. I decided to wing it with some baking.</p>
<p>Yes, I know baking is usually <a href="https://idlermag.com/author/jkolongowski/">Jill’s area</a>, but I promise I yelled really loud across our great state to ask her if she would be okay with me writing about baking.  I took the silence to mean I should probably just go for it.  </p>
<p>After a late lunch/early dinner of sushi (yes, this was on purpose), I got started.</p>

<p>I gathered my baking supplies and iPod so The Mountain Goats (and sometimes Adele) could keep me company.  I tried not to feel too depressed I was baking for one and instead focused on how awesome this might turn out.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>  I also kept in mind that, in the end, I would be entitled to share my bounty of cupcakes with exactly no one while watching <em>Air Jaws Apocalypse</em> (these are the thoughts that urge me onwards in times of trial, you guys).</p>
<p>The plan was simple:  Make bloody adorable Lemon Shark cupcakes.</p>
<p>I picked a <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-white-cake/" target="_blank">simple white cake recipe</a> and added the zest of two lemons and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, hoping this would all end up as lemony as possible and not gross.</p>
<p>Once the batter was mixed I separated about a half cup of batter away from the batch to dye red.  The rest got blue like Tobias Funke. </p>

This was happening!</p>
<p>Once the cupcakes were in the oven I started to clean up, and then realized cleaning sucks and I should have a drink while I washed dishes.  I highly recommend wine (and more Adele) for this part of the solitary baking process.</p>
<p>30 minutes later, the cupcakes were done.  The next thing to do while they cooled was to start fixing the butter cream frosting.  Yes, I know there are ready available frostings I could have bought at the store, but that’s not how I roll.  Don’t tell me how to live my life!</p>
<p>The butter cream was going to take about 20 minutes of mixing, so I stuck the cakes in the fridge to make sure they’d be ready when the frosting was.</p>
<p>Guys? 20 minutes of mixing is a long time to watch a machine spin butter and sugar around all by yourself.</p>
<p>I had some more wine.</p>

<p>Soon the cakes were cooled and the frosting was finished.  After filling the cupcakes with strawberry jam I tried to be one with the ocean as I squeezed my delectable ocean blue (read: as blue as I could get it because I ran out of dye) frosting from my pastry bag into little cupcake sized waves. I added a yummy candy lemon fruit slice dorsal fin on top, and voilà!</p>
<p>Strawberry/Lemon Shark Cupcakes!</p>

<p>The lemon really came through in the cake, and the strawberry jam was strawberry jam so of course that was delicious.  My mother’s butter cream frosting?  Forgeddaboudit.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Sure, they’re not shark cupcakes like <a href="http://store.discovery.com/dc-cupcakes-shark-week-dozen/detail.php?p=375803&amp;v=tlc_shows_dc-cupcakes&amp;ecid=SMM-DSC-00273&amp;pa=SMM-DSC-00273#mkcpgn=fbdsc1" target="_blank">THESE</a> are shark cupcakes, but mine were CONCEPT cupcakes!  I was all alone and I don’t know how to mold fondant!  What do you want from me?  </p>
<p>No, I will not share them!  </p>
<p>My private feeding frenzy ensues!</p>
<p>Happy Shark Week everybody!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a name="note1"></a>1. I am a recreational, not pro baker, so I had no idea how to bake myself just one fancy little cupcake like Kristen Wiig’s character does in <em>Bridesmaids</em>.  Besides, if I only made one cupcake how would I know if a second or third cupcake would be just as delicious?  Or the sixth or the twelfth??  I’m not a wizard!  Unless the cupcakes turn out awesome.  Then I’m a wizard!</p>
<p><a name="note2"></a>2. I am a wizard!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a breakfast purist. Even if, like yesterday, I’m not up and out of bed until noon, I’m having breakfast for my first meal of the day. No cold pizza or soggy leftover bullshit. Breakfast is way too good to miss out on. I also have strict ideas about what breakfast should be. For example, I don’t think steak belongs anywhere near my eggs. Nor ham. What is this, lunch? No. I’ve only recently come to terms with potatoes as part of breakfast, and even that’s iffy.</p>
<p>Because of my irrational breakfast rules, I was never interested in biscuits and gravy for breakfast. While I love biscuits, I could not handle the thought of gravy in the morningtime. I realize that it’s gravy made with breakfast sausage, but I couldn’t separate it from the kind of gravy that belongs on turkey and mashed potatoes, and that kind of gravy should get the right the fuck out of my breakfast.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled on this <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/biscuits-and-veggie-sausage-gr-147646" target="_blank">recipe</a> for homemade biscuits and vegetarian sausage gravy. I’m not a vegetarian, but I love Morning Star’s sausage patties because they’re easy to make and a little bit healthier than regular sausage. The pictures on that blog post looked so amazing, they sold me. More often than not, I reject food outright for no good reason at all, so I decided to give this a try.</p>
<p>First came Alton Brown’s biscuits. I’d never made biscuits from scratch before, and the recipe was asking me to do some awfully strange things. I read and reread the recipe to remember what to do. First, I had to mix the fats (butter and shortening) with the dry ingredients WITH MY HANDS. I had no idea what I was doing. I sort of vaguely smooshed the stuff around until it seemed mixed, though it was hard to tell. Then, I made a well in the middle of the bowl for the chilled buttermilk, as instructed:</p>

<p>I stirred the dough until it was just combined, and plopped it onto the cutting board. In order to keep the biscuits fluffy, you’re not supposed to knead the dough very much at all. I got extremely paranoid about over-kneading because WHAT IF THE WHOLE THING IS RUINED. I formed the dough into a circle (a challenge because the dough was so sticky it didn’t want to move where I wanted), and asked Charlie if it was one inch thick.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, “That’s less than an inch.” I have such poor spatial reasoning I’m incapable of seeing what an inch looks like without getting out a ruler. I folded the dough over, but the flour from the cutting board kept the two halves from sticking together. I immediately started swearing and complaining that I&#8217;d screwed it up. The dough did not look cute at all.</p>

<p>The oven was already preheated and there was no point in quitting while I was so far along. Apparently there’s some sort of tool you can use to cut the biscuits into even circles, but I didn’t know such a thing existed. Instead I used a cup to make biscuit slices, putting the leftover scraps together each time to make new biscuits. They were wildly inconsistent.</p>

<p>Into the oven they went, and I started to make the gravy. I cooked the Morning Star sausage patties, crumbling them up as I went, and put them on a plate off to the side. The recipe told me to whisk the flour in with the butter once the butter started foaming. But the pan was so hot from the sausage that the butter started foaming almost instantly, some of it burning in the center of the pan. I panicked and dumped the flour and milk in at once, whisking like it would all be okay if I just WHISKED FAST ENOUGH.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’d messed up the timing, and the biscuits were done earlier than I expected. But they looked delicious, if a little lopsided, so I started to feel like perhaps I hadn’t screwed up everything.</p>

<p>It turns out gravy is really simple, guys. I thought you had to add a bunch of spices or corn starch or something, but it’s just milk, butter, flour, salt, and pepper. I added the sausage back to the gravy, and let it thicken. I called Charlie over multiple times to check if the gravy looked edible, since he’s much more of a gravy expert than I am. Eventually, it started to look like it should.</p>
<p>We split open a biscuit, and between how fluffy they turned out and the way the gravy smelled, I was willing to admit I’d been totally wrong about sausage gravy.</p>

<p>I worried that it might be bland with just salt and pepper for spices, but hot damn was this hearty and delicious. I wanted to put on some flannel and go split logs when I was done. My apologies to sausage gravy for shunning you for so long. We will have to make up for lost time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never cared much about Valentine’s Day, one way or the other. I don’t moon over a romantic evening or loudly proclaim that it’s some corporate bullshit designed to play on our tender emotions in order to get us to buy diamonds and chocolate. I’d rather get worked up over something important, like getting blue-shelled at the end of a <em>Mario Kart</em> race. Even though Saint Valentine was a pretty cool guy, Charlie and I take the opportunity to spend some time together and maybe eat some excellent food, rather than buying gifts.</p>
<p>As usual, though, I decided to bake my heart out and charm Charlie with something neither of us should be eating. In general, we eat pretty healthy, so I like to use as much butter and sugar as possible when I make a treat. I’d had this recipe for <a href="http://bakeitinacake.com/recipes/doublerainbowcupcakes" target="_blank">Double Rainbow Coconut Cupcakes</a> from the wonderful Bake It in a Cake website saved on my computer for months. If you would like to salivate over some amazing recipes, go there. She literally bakes things into cakes and cupcakes. It’s genius.</p>
<p>The recipe is immensely complicated, which is part of the reason I chose it. Baking feels natural to me &#8212; with all its exact measurements, way easier than cooking &#8212; so I like to try something difficult and see if I can do it without screwing up too badly. And this recipe has MARZIPAN RAINBOWS baked inside coconut cupcakes, topped with buttercream frosting and rainbow coconut. It needed three and a half sticks of butter. The only answer is yes.</p>
<p>A warning: If you want to make this yourself, marzipan is EXPENSIVE. I paid $14 for two packages, which only made 12 cupcakes. Another warning: Cream of coconut is near impossible to find. I tried three different grocery stores, including Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods. On the morning I planned to make the cupcakes, I drove back to Safeway with my hair disheveled and without having eaten breakfast and tried to recall all the research I’d done. At last, I found a sad, discounted squeeze-bottle of coconut cream next to the liquors &#8212; in addition to baking, it’s also used to make piña coladas. I went home triumphant, rolled up my sleeves, and began.</p>
<p>Marzipan is almond candy dough. I divided it into six sections, and started to dye them. I had no idea how much food coloring to use, so just squeezed some on and started smooshing it around like Play-doh. The red made my hands look like I’d murdered someone. It was fun as hell, even though it took an immense amount of time. I kept having to stop and wash my hands to keep the colors from bleeding and to sprinkle powdered sugar to keep the marzipan from getting too sticky.</p>

<p>Then, I had to roll out the each of the colors into long strips, which I’d then stack in order to make the rainbows. I don’t have a rolling pin, so I did the civilized thing and rolled the dough into little snakes with my hands, then used a plastic cup and my fingers to roll it flat. I’m completely incapable of measuring anything spatially, so I used a tape measure to make sure each strip was as close as possible to the 12 inches x 2 inches the recipe recommended. The dough stretched and broke a lot, and I worried that the rainbows wouldn’t look very cute and ALL WOULD BE LOST.</p>

<p>I trimmed the end and the sides with a butter knife to make right angles, anxiety-eating most of the leftover dough as I went. Then, I cut the rainbows into 12 pieces. I shouldn’t have worried, because they turned out so fucking cute.</p>

<p>The recipe had called for toasted coconut. While on my quest for cream of coconut, I’d looked for pre-toasted coconut, but I have no idea if that actually exists. I never did find it. How hard could it be to toast my own coconut? While I was playing with the dough, I’d put a cup of coconut on a baking sheet and put it in the oven for five minutes at a time, according to the internet. I used a near-empty bag of coconut that had been in my pantry for longer than I care to admit &#8212; I figured it would be safe after it had been toasted, then baked. The coconut was done after only ten minutes. It probably could have toasted longer, but I was afraid it would burn.</p>

<p>Next, I mixed the dough and poured it into the cupcake pan, two tablespoons at a time. I used skim milk rather than the whole milk the recipe called for, as if that made up for the three and a half sticks of butter. I’d also used wheat flour &#8212; not because it’s healthy, but because I’m lazy and it’s what I had on hand. Then, I pressed the rainbows into the batter. They looked enormous, especially on top of the two tablespoons of batter in each cup. The cups nearly overflowed even before I topped the rainbows with dough.</p>

<p>The recipe told me I shouldn’t press the rainbows all the way down to the bottom, but I had to press them in a little to keep the dough from running over. All my alarm bells were going off like YOU ARE SCREWING IT ALL UP but there was no stopping the rainbow cupcake train. I put the cupcakes in the oven.</p>

<p>While the cupcakes baked, I started to dye the coconut for the topping. I almost skipped this step because it’s so pointless, but I knew it would be so effing adorable that I couldn’t resist. My food coloring is made of gel; I couldn’t get it to mix with the coconut. I decided to mix the gel with water, and dumped the water in the coconut. It was pretty and soggy. The coconut probably wasn’t supposed to be wet, but at least it looked good.</p>

<p>I whipped together the butter and powdered sugar to make the buttercream frosting, and checked on the cupcakes. They were HUGE. I sat in front of the oven and watched the batter creep toward the edges of the pan like it was going to fall off a cliff. It was all very dire. After 25 minutes, I pulled the cupcakes out. The kitchen smelled incredible, but they were some ugly, lopsided fuckers. I could see the rainbow peeping through the wrappers and worried that the marzipan had melted.</p>

<p>Feeling disheartened, worried that I’d wasted too much time and money on this ridiculous idea, I was decidedly un-Valentiney. Once the cupcakes were cool, I frosted them and sprinkled the dyed coconut on top in miniature rainbows. They were cute as fuck, even if they still looked a little wonky and I had no idea how they would taste.</p>

<p>Turns out, there was a reason to warn against pushing the rainbows all the way down. The marzipan had sank to the bottom of the cupcake and fused to the wrappers. If you were careful, you could peel the wrapper off and only eat a minimal amount of paper.  But dear sweet Saint Valentine did they taste incredible.</p>

<p>It took me three hours to bake and nearly 45 minutes to clean up the kitchen, but I believe Charlie’s exact words were, “Holy shit.” That’s love. Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone.</p>
<p><em>Postscript</em>: For next time, I’d use white flour. It would be so much prettier that way. I’d also cut the rainbows much smaller so they won’t stick to the bottom, and make smaller cupcakes. I ended up with a lot of extra dough, but I’d run out of cupcake wrappers. I had so much extra that I attempted to make more plain cupcakes AND a cake, both of which stuck to the pan. I ended up digging pieces of them out with my fingers and dipping them in the extra buttercream, then throwing the rest away. It was after midnight before I awoke from my sugar coma and was able to eat normal food.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I’m in the process of moving across the country, cooking has been the farthest thing from my mind. I eat odd things at odd hours of the day and spend the rest of the time searching for things I’ve lost in one box or another, lamenting my less-than-stellar eating habits to anyone who will listen, and sleeping. Before I left, my aunts gave me a going-away present: <em><a href="http://bit.ly/qWO2Hf">The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook: From Cauldron Cakes to Knickerbocker Glory&#8211;More Than 150 Magical Recipes for Wizards and Non-Wizards Alike</a> </em>by Dinah Bucholz. Because I’d planned my move around the midnight showing of the last Harry Potter movie, it was the perfect time to get out my wand (or, as my father so adorably called it, my “wizard stick”) and drown my sadness in some Harry Potter treats.</p>
<p>I spent my non-driving hours during the car ride from Boston to Michigan perusing the book and planning a Harry Potter lunch of epic proportions before the midnight showing. As the day got closer, I started to get unreasonably anxious. I often get anxious before large-scale events that have nothing to do with me (Spartan football games, Broadway musicals, and apparently midnight showings). It’s probably some sort of misplaced excitement, but as stupid as it sounds, the end of the Harry Potter franchise was a big moment for me. I’m only repeating what’s been said by anyone my age who started reading the series when they were the same age as the characters. (I was 12, and still young enough to believe that Hogwarts just might be real and my letter had just gotten lost. Yes, it probably wasn’t real. But maybe it <em>could</em> be.) As someone who reads every day, I still believe that I’ll never enjoy reading a book as much as I enjoyed reading the last Harry Potter book.</p>

<p>It may be that my quitting my job and moving from one coast to another coincided with what I’ll go ahead and call The Unofficial End of my Childhood, but I started to get more and more anxious about my big planned lunch. After weighing my options, I decided to downgrade to a snack, so that my epic lunch didn’t make me rushed and late for the movie. I chose to make some Pumpkin Pasties and pretend it was September 1 on the Hogwarts Express, partly because my dad already had most of the ingredients but mostly because the train has all sorts of adorable significance.</p>
<p>When I got to the grocery store, I had a sudden flash of panic. Why had I chosen <em>pumpkin</em>, of all things? It’s not like it’s an ingredient that’s filling the shelves in July. When I asked a worker, she took me over to the aisle and pointed at the small yellow sign: <em>Due to a small crop, canned pumpkin will not be available until the fall. </em>I tried not to have a full-scale meltdown. Apparently I’d attached much more significance to making this dessert than I’d realized.</p>
<p>“What are you making?” the woman asked. Even though I was wearing my Gryffindor scarf, I had moment of shyness and, instead of telling her the truth, I said simply, “A pastry.” “Well,” she said, “can’t you replace it with something? Maybe apple?” I tried very delicately not to lose my shit while I explained to her that it HAS TO BE PUMPKIN AND WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE. She made sure to tell me several times that all the stores in the area were out, and maybe I could just make something else. I said, “No, I really can’t.”</p>
<p>Instead of believing that twit, I went to Meijer. Lo and behold, they had plenty of cans of pumpkin. My adrenaline was pumping and I had a moment of instability where I wanted to go back to Kroger and shove the can of pumpkin in that woman’s face, or perhaps turn her into a bouncing ferret. But I figured my time would be better spent making pastries.</p>
<p>I mixed the butter, shortening, and flour together in the blender, since I had no food processor. The mixture was nothing like the light, fluffy texture it was supposed to be, but I thought I smelled the blender’s metal parts smoking, so I decided to just mix it together by hand and hope for the best. When I was done, the dough didn’t seem as doughy as it should have been, but the recipe specifically said it was better to be too wet than too dry. I wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Next, for the filling, I stirred the godforsaken pumpkin together with cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg. At this point, I realized that I didn’t really have any idea what pasties were (and I knew I wouldn’t be using them in a burlesque show.) Thankfully, my friend Anna came over to partake and had done her research. The pasties should end up looking something like pierogi, filled with the pumpkin, folded over, and pinched on their sides.</p>
<p>I got the dough from the fridge and shaped it into small circles with my hands, since it was too sticky for a rolling pin. I dredged up some old knowledge from making homemade pierogi and started folding. I got too overzealous with the pumpkin filling and had to spoon some out of each pasty before it could close. I poked holes in the top of each to aerate them, and stuck them in the oven.</p>

<p>Anna and I passed the time watching Harry Potter-related videos (I recommend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbH0nbilYek">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a9Z050teRY">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a9Z050teRY">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXuOj9d5o8">this one</a>). I decided to check on the pasties two minutes before their 30 were up, and was glad I did, because the thin edges were burnt. The inside, however, was perfect. The pastry was flaky but not dry, and the pumpkin was hot but didn’t burn. They were sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. They weren’t the prettiest, but they went well with my Gryffindor scarf and were a perfect appetizer to tear-soaked popcorn while I realized that I might be a Muggle after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite writing about food and cooking, most of the time I’d rather just be eating. Eating is immensely more fun than cooking. But there are those rare days when I go all Betty Crocker and want to spend the day in the kitchen. Ever since the grocery store started carrying fresh ears of corn I’ve been waiting to feel like cooking them. You can’t have sweet corn with some lame, easy recipe. Corn made me think of cornbread, and cornbread brought me to ribs. Soon my imaginary dinner had ballooned to epic proportions. In order to cook the <a href="http://bbq.about.com/od/ribrecipes/r/ble31003d.htm">rib recipe</a> I’d found, I had to get up in the morning and get them good and seasoned and in the slow cooker by noon in order to eat before 9. I supposed it was my punishment for not having a grill.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: For the Carnivores</strong></p>
<p>As usual, I procrastinated. On Father’s Day, I decided ribs and cornbread were the perfect tribute to my dad, since I couldn’t be in Michigan to cook them for him. I changed out of my pajamas and hoofed it to the store to pick out a slab of meat. I know most people seem to like their ribs as fatty as possible, but I’m not a tiger and I’d rather not be munching on chewy fat. Give me tender meat, please. As it turns out, the least fatty-looking slab was also the bloodiest.</p>

<p>After taking it out of the package, I felt briefly like becoming a vegetarian. The bones on the backside of the ribs thunked unpleasantly on the wooden cutting board. But my resolve is terrible and after mixing all the spices in the dry rub (brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, salt, cumin, black pepper, white pepper, oregano, cayenne pepper, and a pinch of white sugar), it smelled too delicious to renounce.</p>

<p>The recipe gave no instructions for the dry rub, so I sprinkled it on and gave the slab of ribs a nice massage. By the time I was done, I figured they were relaxed enough to handle five hours in the slow cooker.</p>

<p>I’d accidentally gotten half the amount of ribs I was supposed to. I was very afraid, as usual, of burning them. So I called my mom for advice, and, as a bonus, she was at my grandparents’ house, so I was able to get excellent cheffing advice from both mom and grandma. I put a little water in the bottom of the slow-cooker to keep it moist, and decided to cook it on high for three hours and on low for two.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: For the kids. Or the alcoholics</strong></p>
<p>For dessert, I wanted to make the <a href="http://erincooks.com/mojito-pops/">mojito pops</a> I was too impatient for when I first got my popsicle molds. I bought an incredible amount of citrus, deciding on the spot in the grocery store to use half fresh lime juice and half from a bottle. Since I don’t have a juicer, I juiced four of the limes by hand. This is a very effective way to make a gigantic mess while giving your entire kitchen a strong lime scent and finding any undiscovered cuts on your hands. The recipe also called for two peeled limes and a peeled lemon. As it turns out, lemons and limes don’t like to be peeled much. I cut them up into wedges, as directed, and hoped these effing popsicles would be worth it.</p>

<p>According to the recipe, though, that was the hardest part. It could only get better. Supposedly. I mixed the lime juice with soda water and regular water in a pitcher, then added the sugar, lime and lemon wedges, mint leaves, and rum. Next, I was supposed to “muddle” them, which is just the cutest word ever. The recipe said I could use a wooden spoon if I didn’t have a muddler, and I should smash all the ingredients together. After a few fruitless minutes stabbing into the pitcher with a wooden spoon, I just had some really well-mixed liquid with whole fruit and leaves floating at the top.</p>

<p>Hoping to get some more leverage, I poured the whole mess into a big bowl. This only succeeded in getting the counter and floor very sticky while I muddled away. The fruit stayed stubbornly whole. In desperation, I tried using a potato masher…</p>

What is happening.</p></div>
<p>. . . to no avail. I wondered if it might be better to add more rum and just drink it. But I hadn’t spilled this much to just up and quit. So, I went at the fruit with my bare hands and a knife, cutting and ripping them apart. In retrospect, I may not be very good at peeling citrus.</p>
<p>I kept muddling, and then I just had smaller bits of fruit. None of it was mashing. I thought it would ruin the popsicle to bite into a large chunk of lime. Finally, I got out my stick blender and pureed the shit out of it. I poured it into the popsicle molds, spilling more, where the pureed fruit and mint floated resolutely to the top. The rest of this recipe was supposed to be easy? What a lie that was. I shoved the mess into the freezer and took a swig out of the rum bottle. Moving on.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: For the bakers</strong></p>
<p>When I get in cooking moods, I like to make everything as difficult as possible. I decided to make the cornbread from scratch. With the ribs steaming in the slow-cooker and the popsicles probably sucking in the freezer, I preheated the oven. The <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/excellent-and-healthy-cornbread/Detail.aspx">recipe</a> I had for the cornbread used plain yogurt instead of butter.</p>

<p>Because the recipe said so, I was very careful NOT TO OVERMIX, and when I went to pour the batter into the pan, I saw unmixed bits of flour. I stirred it around in the pan and hoped for the best.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: The Big Finish</strong></p>
<p>While the cornbread was baking and the ribs were allegedly finishing, I took the sweet corn out on the front steps to shuck. Honestly, it was my main reason for getting the corn—sitting on the front steps barefoot while peeling the corn is one of the first kitchen-related things I was allowed to do as a child. It always makes me happy, even though I have to spend a great deal of time trying not to think of the stringy bits as hair.</p>
<p>Back inside, I boiled the corn and waited. Because I’m a freaking expert, I’d timed it so that the corn bread came out first with a little time to cool, and then I turned off the slow-cooker so I could add a little barbecue sauce to the ribs, and then turned off the boiling water.</p>

<p>I was afraid of the ribs so I ate them last. It’s hard to mess up corn, so that was perfection. The cornbread was a cakey texture, but it wasn’t as sweet as I’d like. Next time I’d add a little honey. This time, I poured honey on top. And the ribs. They were so tender the meat slid right off the bones. They were spicy, but the barbecue sauce helped to keep it from being too spicy.</p>
<p>Writing this, I feel ready for a nap. Between the popsicle fiasco and talking on the phone to my mom, grandma, grandpa and dad, I didn’t leave the house all day. I went to the grocery store at 10:45 in the morning and ate at 5. I have a newfound respect for stay-at-home parents. One big meal for myself and I’m SPENT. On the phone, when I told both of my parents and my grandparents that I was cooking a big dinner for myself, they all said the same thing: “Good for you!” as in, congratulations on doing something that is probably a little depressing. But I disagree. And yes. Good for me.</p>
<p><strong>Coda:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The mojito pops were supposed to freeze for over 12 hours, but I don&#8217;t have that kind of patience, especially after how annoying they were. I wasn&#8217;t going to wait around for someone who toys with me like that. So I wrestled a  half-frozen pop out of the mold, leaving half of it in the bottom. Despite all the troubles, it was pretty tasty. The club soda had given the pop a nice texture, and I could taste the rum. It was really more like a rum-and-lime pop, with a little mint, but I&#8217;ll have no problem eating all of them. Next time, though, I&#8217;ll just do the smart thing and make myself an actual mojito instead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We interrupt our regularly scheduled healthy programming for some dessert. And probably diabetes.</p>
<p>My boyfriend Charlie just moved to San Francisco for a new job. While I had my family’s help moving from Michigan to Boston, he called up some movers for most of his things, packed the rest into his car, and drove west. While he waits for his moving truck to get there with his pots and pans and bowls and plates, he’s living off ramen noodles and Taco Bell. He’s not the sort of man who complains, but I know I’d have a decent-sized meltdown about not having any of my stuff and OH MY GOD I’M GOING TO BE FAT AND BROKE FROM EATING THIS WAY. I always feel like I need to fix things when they’re broken or make people smile when they are not, so I wanted to make his new apartment feel like home. Since I can’t be there to go to Ikea and Pier One and buy all sorts of pretend-fancy things, and a quiche won’t keep for the three days it’ll take to ship, I decided on cookies.</p>
<p>But I’ve graduated from your basic from-scratch chocolate cookie. Charlie and I have been together for almost seven years, but I still want the guy to think I’m the shit. I have to up the ante. I was (ironically) searching for healthy cookies, when I found a blog post about <a href="http://picky-palate.com/2011/01/06/oreo-stuffed-chocolate-chip-cookies/">these beauties</a>. Healthy went right out the window. There was no way I’d be able to resist the <em>Inception</em> of cookies: chocolate-chip cookies. Stuffed with Oreos. A cookie within a cookie.</p>
<p>The recipe went viral (how could it not?!?), and I read up on comments and suggestions, and decided to follow those of <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/02/oreo-nutter-butter-chocolate-chip-stuffed-cookies-recipes.html">this blogger</a>—halve the chocolate chips, so you can retain the taste of the cookies’ Oreo heart, and use Double-Stuf Oreos (for obvious reasons).  I went to the store and gathered the ingredients to whip up a heart attack.</p>

Both sticks of butter were required.</p></div>
<p>I got to use my new bowls, first creaming the butter and sugars (plural, both brown and white), adding vanilla and eggs, and then adding the dry ingredients. The recipe called for a full tablespoon of vanilla, which always makes the cookie dough irresistible. Charlie may have ended up with fewer cookies than I’d hoped to give him—I ate a staggering amount of the dough. Sometimes I think that’s almost better than the eating the cookie itself.</p>

<p>Next came the part of the recipe that any adult who’s not supposed to play with her food looks forward to: molding the dough around the Oreos. The recipe warned about using too much dough, making sure you pinch the edges completely, blah blah, but please—it’s cookie dough around ANOTHER COOKIE. You can do no wrong.</p>

<p>I used an ice cream scoop to measure out the dough, one scoop on either side. I sort of measured, trying to make sure I had enough dough to cover the Oreo each time—I didn’t want the Oreo to poke out and spoil the surprise, because what would the point be after that? After lining up all the cookies on a baking sheet, I began to have doubts about whether these would ever finish baking. They were MONSTROUS.</p>

<p>I slid them into the oven and started to wait. I tried to clean up the kitchen while I waited, but I was useless because I had to stop every minute and check on the cookies like they were a dozen fussy babies. They were so gigantic I was afraid of them spreading out on the cookie sheet and becoming one massive chocolate-chip-Oreo-cookie monster that would become sentient and kill us all.</p>
<p>After nine minutes, they weren’t close to done. After thirteen minutes, they were no different. The recipe recommended 8-15 minutes, and after 15 minutes, my cookies were still gooey and I worried that I’d left out the baking soda or something else idiotic like that. I put them in for two more minutes and crossed my fingers.</p>

<p>They were an abomination to suggested serving sizes, but they were done. It was clear that I’d been way too overzealous with the cookie dough and not careful enough with the shaping—you’ll notice the appetizing tumor-like shape of some of them. For the second batch, I used much less dough and spread it thinner. They were still ridiculous, but a little less so.</p>

<p>I took a bite. Oreo, chocolate, vanilla, and oh goodness there aren’t really words. These are the kind of cookies that demand milk. I could only have one. Maybe ever. The problem is, they opened up a Pandora’s box of cookies stuffed with cookies stuffed with cookies… I had the sudden thought that these might be good baked in brownies, and maybe I could put the brownies inside some sort of cake, and I knew it was time to put the flour away and go to bed before things got out of control.</p>
<p>For now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my friend and <em>Idler</em> editor <a href="http://idler-mag.com/author/craiggav/">Gavin</a> suggested that I make cinnamon rolls, I jumped at the chance. I love to bake&mdash;everything makes so much sense when you’re baking. There’s none of the stupid ambiguity that exists in cooking (cook until done? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?), and if you just follow directions, everything comes out well. Baking is a perfectionist’s dream. </p>
<p>I found <a target="new" href="http://bit.ly/1jYOi">a recipe for cinnamon rolls</a> (and not the Pillsbury kind) on the Food Network’s website. It’s one of Paula Deen’s recipes, which I knew meant a lot of butter. And, according to Julia Child, “With butter, anything is good.” Since I was baking cinnamon rolls, I knew I was throwing healthy eating right out the window and I wanted as much butter and sugar as possible.</p>
<p>As usual, I had a dilemma in the grocery store. All of the ingredients were straightforward except for the yeast. I’ve never cooked with yeast and had no idea what to do with it. I’d read the recipe, and it said something about dissolving the yeast in water. I stood in the aisle for a good 15 minutes reading the backs of the packages of yeast. One said it could be added in with the wet ingredients. Another said you should dissolve it. A third said you could do either. I didn’t know anything about yeast, but I did know that screwing up the yeast would screw up the whole recipe. No pressure. I crossed my fingers, chose the dissolving yeast, and went home.</p>
<p>I knew the recipe would be time consuming, so I took my time on Saturday morning. I ate a real breakfast, drank my coffee, finished a book. Then, I watched the video of Paula Deen making the cinnamon rolls. The yeast had to rise not once, but THREE EFFING TIMES. I counted down the hours, and I realized it would be around 4 p.m. by the time I had my cinnamon rolls. But let’s face it&mdash;there is never a bad time for cinnamon rolls.</p>
<p>To start, I opened the packet of yeast, dumped it into a bowl of warm water, then stirred it. In the video to accompany the recipe, Paula sniffs the yeast and talks about some sort of biscuit she had when she was little and because of that, well, she just <em>loved</em> the smell of yeast. I don’t know what in the hell she is smoking, because it smells like something that I should buy from a dealer. And not in a good way. I mixed the yeast in with the other ingredients (the first dose of butter and sugar) and added flour until the mixture actually looked like dough. </p>

<p>Now, I had to let it sit. FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF. The recipe started telling me to preheat the oven, but I decided that I’d only do that if I wanted to burn the house down. Because I had a long, long time to kill and I’d soon be eating a treat that had used 2 sticks of butter and 4 cups of sugar, I went for a run. I spent most of it being creeped out by the yeast. I mean, the fact that you have to let it grow is just wrong. I didn’t feel ok leaving it in my house by itself. What if it just. . . kept growing? WHAT’S TO STOP IT THEN?</p>
<p>I came home, and the dough had indeed doubled in size. The recipe said to punch it down, but I’m not a violent person and I wanted the dough to be flaky, so I pressed it down gently, and rolled the dough out. Then it was time for another round of butter and sugar&mdash;a layer of softened butter and a cinnamon and sugar mix, along with some chopped pecans. I was feeling pretty professional, wearing my apron over my running clothes, so I added extra cinnamon. Watch out. I’m pretty much a renegade.</p>

<p>You’ll notice, if you’re looking closely, that I actually got out a ruler to make sure the dough was 15” by 9” like the recipe said. </p>
<p>I rolled the dough up, and cut it into little rolls. At first I way underestimated the size I should cut, so I ended up with a few baby rolls. I decided they could just be appetizers. Or midnight snacks, depending. I lined them up in a pan for round 3 of butter and sugar&mdash;the pan was coated with butter and sprinkled with sugar.</p>

<p>And now, I had to wait for 45 more minutes for the yeast to keep doing its thang. I cleaned up the kitchen and also eradicated world hunger. I had all day, after all. At the end of time, the dough didn’t look like it had changed at all, but it was time, finally, for it to go into the oven. For half an hour. I’d aged several years by the time they were done and ready for the fourth and final round of butter and sugar&mdash;the glaze. I had a newly-opened bottle of vanilla extract, and it poured out into the glaze way too fast, so they ended up with more vanilla than was probably intended.</p>

<p>But dear sweet jesus, these were some of the best things I have ever eaten. They were sweet, but not too sweet; crispy, but still fluffy. My roommate’s boyfriend said they rivaled something he’d eaten at one of his favorite bakeries, where pecan rolls are their specialty. I’m in such a sugar-and-butter coma that I’ve gone past the point of modesty.</p>
<p>Bring it, readers. What should I make next?</p>
