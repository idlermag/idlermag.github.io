										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My parents were divorced and my mom was mentally ill throughout most of my childhood so I didn’t always learn a lot about how to be a “proper” girl or woman &#8212; I’m an adult who is still figuring out liquid liner.  In a number of ways, I love that I wasn’t forced into a pink category, that I played Ninja Turtles and watched wrestling, that I had He-Man action figures and wore weird mismatched outfits of my choosing. So, please don’t take the following text to mean that my dad was some monster. This is definitely NOT the intent and in fact he’s a lot more like Santa Claus than anyone else I can think of. He did a pretty good job trying to help me be me and grow and take care of myself, but his lack of hair knowledge was a bit of a hindrance. He didn’t help me with my “Embarrassing Moments” hair woes because, as a man, he didn’t know they existed. What I know now that I didn’t then is that society is kind of a jerk to women and it expects a lot out of our bodies and out of our hair. I wish I had had a Frida Kahlo fairy godmother to help me suss this out earlier, or maybe Madonna, if she’d kept those thick spidery brows, or fellow helmet head Daria. But I didn’t. So, here are a few things I wish I had known.  </p>
<p><strong>I Wish Someone Had Taught Me:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The difference between high brow and low brow.</strong></li>
<p>When I was in the sixth grade I had full-on 80’s Madonna brows, the kind that have at least four regions to each brow, they’re so big. What no one told me was if you paid a professional to wax or expertly tweeze that bottom chunk, you could still be left with 2 fairly thick, yet fantastic eyebrows. Or, that pretty much anything is better than giving a sixth grader free-tweezing reign over her forehead hair because she is gonna pluck the fuck outta those suckers and then become a 31-year-old person who can list “growing brows” as a hobby on Facebook.</p>
<p>Ok, to be fair, I knew that waxing made the brows look amazing. My friends all shared stories about how their mom took them to Elizabeth Arden, or even a hair cutting place I had actually heard of. However, I felt I would not be afforded such a luxury &#8212; how could my dad understand that he’d be helping me shape the brows that would define my life?! I just wish future me could go back and give my lovely Madonna brows a pep talk, maybe with a Whoopie Goldberg <em>Ghost</em>-style speech to really get the point across, “Little self, put those tweezers down &#8212; you’re in danger, girl!”</p>
<li><strong>That straighteners exist and that naturally pretty hair is a lie.</strong></li>
<p>Okay, maybe not all pretty hair is a lie but at least that “pretty” is suspicious.  For about 25 years of my life I’ve assumed that popular girl hair was a magically bouncy, shiny and fantastic boon bequeathed upon only the richest and fanciest look-at-me-I-eat-at-Red-Lobster-and-it’s-not-even-a-special- occasion divas. In my younger days, I assumed that the Barbie girls just woke up with perfectly scrunchied barrel curls, bangs elegantly reaching skyward with a mere spritz of spray.  If they needed a little help perhaps a ritual blood-letting or a simple kitten sacrifice to Aphrodite, and voila! Perfection. (Because popular girls read their Edith Hamilton, right?) I was sure I was destined to my thick, coarse, bell-shaped helmet because all I had was a round brush, blow dryer, and my stupid Catholic saints to help me. </p>
<p>Alas, there is no Saint Perpetua de la Coiffure and I didn’t really have internet access until college, so you can imagine my shock when I discovered hair straightening technology. Science! After a quick 40-minute blow dry I can now straighten 500 or so tressy chunks of my head and thusly trick everyone into the belief that my mammalian strands are not just normal, but nice, even. Until it rains.</p>
<li><strong>That perms don’t belong on third graders.</strong></li>
<p>This should be self explanatory.  Why did we DO this?  Why did adults let us do this?  How was looking like Eraserhead &#8212; not to mention pouring pungent chemicals all over a child’s noggin &#8212; a cute trend in the way of slap bracelets and hypercolor t-shirts?!  Forget the face on Mars, this is a UNIVERSAL MYSTERY.</p>
<li><strong>That, “Hey, don’t shave all your parts.”</strong></li>
<p>When I got the green light from my dad to go ahead and shave my legs if I felt like it, I had a bit of a lightbulb moment. As I watched my gams shed their thick and lustrous Sasquatch fur, I felt a strange sensation of feminine empowerment. . . or was that the stinging pain of bleeding? Oh, how soft and silky and attractive my stems/stumps had become!  </p>
<p>What if&#8230;what if&#8230;What if I shaved the entirety of my body to be free of hairs (A.K.A. The Follicled Menace)?!! </p>
<p>Oh, and I did it.  Knuckles, elbows, face. Peach fuzz be damned, I’m a LADY!  What I wish I had the forethought to have seen at this turning point was that, much like the hair on my head, all those little hairs were gonna grow back &#8212; and thickly and thoroughly with a pokey vengeance and much itching.  And it’s stupid to shave your toe knuckles, Stupid. And hey, remember your dad’s face? How he shaves it and gets a 5 o’clock shadow at noon? Well, shit. So, “hey, don’t shave all your parts” would have been a nice heads up. That’s all I’m saying.</p>
<li><strong>That dyeing your mustache will just give you a creepy blonde mustache.</strong></li>
<p>Again, help a sister out. I have a pretty sizable overbite and never got braces because, “meh, they look fine.” There’s no way my family was shelling out cash to deal with my Magnum P.I. situation.  I took matters into my own hands on a tip from <em>Young and Modern</em> (<em>YM</em>) magazine and I sported a blonde ‘stache that perfectly matched my jet black hair for an embarrassing portion of my existence on this planet.</p>
<li><strong>That conditioner is a thing and so is social conditioning.</strong></li>
<p>When I was a little kid, my hair was pretty fun. My dad would squish a lot of shampoo into it and give me a very impressive Ed Grimley hairdo.  Less fun was the brushing and the styling of the hair, as you see, my dad didn’t know that conditioner existed. Once the old chap figured that one out, the tangles were less tangly and the brushing was more manageable. The ponytails, well, they still were a little tight, pulling my eyes sideways on more than a few occasions, but as Dad would say, “Pain is beauty, beauty pain.”  </p>
<p>Even though he was trying to collect my hair into a quirky side-pigtail just like his favorite female college basketball player, even though he was wearing a pro-woman t-shirt from a feminist rally on the day I was born, even though he was breaking all kinds of gender norms by being my mom AND my dad, there’s still that pesky conditioner that can get in our eyes and in my experience, it’s not the tearless kind.
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Wes Anderson’s latest film, <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>, “emotionally disturbed” 12-year-olds Suzy and Sam run away from their depressing and angst-ridden 1965-era lives to be with each other out in the open air of a New England island.  Their plan doesn’t have much of a future, but the brevity of their escape makes it all the sweeter. Their runaway kingdom doesn’t fall victim to boredom. Its patterns don’t become rote or mechanical. Always on the run, one step ahead of the law and a melodramatic social services worker dressed to vaudevillian villain perfection, our heroic “tweens” hover in a state of latency &#8212; no longer children, but not yet adults.</p>
<p>The film begins with, and keeps returning to, the archetypal flood myth &#8212; Sam first sees Suzy when the latter is playing a raven in a summer production of <em>Noye’s Flood</em>. This mythic story not only drives the plot forward with its promise of a disastrous and world-changing flood/denouement, but it also introduces the themes of coupling, mating, and having sex which will develop into tropes of adulthood. The film is held together by relationships and perspectives &#8212; distances, intimacies, nearness and farness. Sex, though only hinted at cartoonishly by the Noah performance, is prevalent for the older set of characters (a dusty and wrung out crew including Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Bruce Willis). Hardly passionate or even sexy, sex for these grown ups is old and tired, a burdensome secret, an unuttered word separating twin beds.</p>
<p>For Sam and Suzy however, intimacy is king though they do inch closer to becoming sexual beings i.e. adults. Initially avoiding the immediacy of sex, their courtship occurs long distance as they pen letters back and forth to one another. Presented in a montage, we hear their voices speak of the very real and grown-up-sized pain of their otherwise childish lives. They feel cooped up, trapped, bored, lonely.  They don’t play well with others.  Suzy’s parents don’t understand her.  Sam’s parents are dead and he has to make his way through the foster system.  Their insights and advice to one another are at once touchingly appropriate and unintentionally silly.  They are there for one another in genuinely meaningful ways, but they are also very much still children despite the formality of their missives’ greetings and closings. Clearly, they know the patterns of adult relations, but they are still playing in these forms rather than living in them, and the structures remain a bit ill-fitting.</p>
<p>When they run away together, issues of intimacy and adult vs. child continue to unfurl.  Anderson’s camera eye constantly places our little lovers in shots that separate them in perfect symmetry.  Like middle schoolers across the dance floor they are attracted to each other, but scared, unsure &#8212; a mysterious gulf between them.  And both characters seem to be more comfortable with distance.  Suzy is shielded behind her power of quiet sight and her trusty binoculars.  Sam, a seer as well, is a talented painter of “mostly landscapes, some nudes.”  Together they enter a more adult context as a couple against the world that only further highlights how unprepared they are for that adventure.  Their beach blanket makeout scene, for example, is not all that sexy.  Suzy apologizes for the breasts that have not yet made themselves known. Sam spits with an almost too comical “ptooohey” sound after they kiss with tongues &#8212; he had some sand in his mouth.</p>
<p>Still with the adults&#8217; ho-hum lives as a backdrop, the children’s brief escape builds perspective.  We imagine as children that growing up will be an answer that gives us voice and meaning and purpose, but the grown figures in <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> are lost, searching just like the children, differing only in that they are closer to giving up. The children long to be adults. The adults calcifying in their present long to be youthful and effective. The film builds itself through this parallax comparing distance and perspective around that magical turning point of becoming/adult, loss of innocence, Summer’s end, loss of virginity.</p>
<p>Upon going through a commitment ceremony, if not lawful wedding with Sam, Suzy forgets her super power, loses her eyes, by leaving behind her binoculars. If we agree with Freud that there are no accidents, does this mistake show that upon entry into an adult institution Suzy immediately loses her fantasy and her special power? A dark reading at best. However, leaving the binoculars also hinders the couple’s escape, so perhaps the “forgetting” marks Suzy’s desire to linger in childhood a little longer.  Her pretend marriage helping her understand that realistically she needs more time.  The film seems to stay appropriately ambiguous on this point, pushing the boundaries of that in-between a little longer.  All I know is when I left the theater after watching <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> that day, I (30 years old) fell in the parking lot and skinned my knee like I had done so often on elementary school blacktops. This too seemed Freudian, Anderson-esque, and an entirely appropriate epilogue to a movie about how we live through the practice of looking forward and looking back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s something so sincere about Muppets. Though made of felt in Crayola colors, they seem to radiate something more human than the human. A stringy ear shake from Sesame Street’s Barkley, a gentle spindly-frog-armed gesture from Kermit, a huffy contraction of the snout from Piggy &#8211;these non-verbal cues were so expressive and meaningful and alive. The Muppets Jim Henson reared are a delightfully strange, cheerily irreverent, intensely empathic, wild, caring, and fun bunch. Jason Segel and Nick Stoller did a pretty great job of reviving these essential Muppet traits in the recently released film, The Muppets, even as the movie itchily reminds us that we can never really bring back time (or Muppets) past.</p>
<p>Ultimately, art imitates life as both the film’s story and its actual production focus on the basic goal of “getting the band back together.” Segel, an avid Muppet fan (see <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em> for a nod at his obsession) was saddened by the presence, or lack thereof, of Muppetry in the 2000s. He saw his childhood friends, once hobnobbing with the likes of Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin, now reduced to cheesy hawkers of pan pizza and the like on stupid television commercials. His project <em>The Muppets</em> (2011) would thus rescue our pop culture icons from obscurity and restore them to their proper place in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>Likewise, within the film we find Henson’s crew lost and scattered across the globe. Kermit’s Hollywood mansion is a decrepit and cobweb-covered mausoleum &#8212; a shrine to a dead past (think a less creepy <em>Sunset Boulevard</em>).  The movie shows us the world as it is now: chock-full of reality shows that capitalize on our least admirable human qualities and aim for the lowest level of thought, comedy and viewer engagement. In this world, the Muppets are a memory, something we recall from a time before, but a group that has fallen too far behind to be viable.  Is there room for the intricate gesticulating of handmade felt Muppets in our digitized, multitasking, screen-based land of plenty? This is what the film (and Segel) ask, and I bet you can guess their answer.</p>
<p>The tone toward the Muppets is right. The respect for Henson’s clan is palpable, cleverly rendered and tender. The musical numbers are pleasurable (if not all knock-outs) and quirkily styled by Bret McKenzie of <em>Flight of the Conchords</em> fame. &#8220;Muppet or a Man&#8221; is the movie’s catchy and clear stand-out of a song, but it’s the old standards (&#8220;Rainbow Connection,&#8221; &#8220;The Muppet Show theme&#8221;) that shake an audience member, like me, to the core.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is this: the movie is pretty good, yet it’s not what I remember. It’s not a Jim Henson Muppet movie. In trying to bring the Muppets back, it mostly reminds me that the Muppets and the time of the Muppets &#8212; my childhood spent awestruck by a rainbow busting through a movie studio ceiling, moments when Kermie’s felty fingers touched my heart because even without being green, I understood what he meant when he said it wasn’t easy &#8212; are lost to the tricks of time.  Though I can try to reconfigure these fragments to some extent, like the movie re-pieces together the scattered Muppets, the initial loss continues to leave a gaping hole in my squishy red innards.</p>
<p>I cried at least three times during this movie.  It killed me to see Kermit’s movie lot office in tatters &#8212; a framed picture of Jim Henson displayed under a skin of dust, hung there for no one.  Then there was the pang in the gut, the sour ball of throat tears that came when Kermit apologized to Fozzie for losing touch &#8212; a shame all of us grown-ups comprehend.  And of course, hearing &#8220;Rainbow Connection&#8221; again, the way it prickles my skin and digs into me with its instant nostalgia.  The song is housed once more in a Muppet movie, but not one I know from before; it’s transplanted, grafted onto the new.</p>
<p>I suffer a postmodern crisis.</p>
<p>Plush childhood things have been shifted into an adult schema. I never wanted to know that Piggy and Kermie got divorced! I never wanted to see Fozzie a washed up comedy bear in Reno! However, the movie also does something pretty remarkable in that it allows me to feel, re-feel and reflect on lost time, on missing a childhood that was so intricately tied to a bunch of fancy puppets. The Muppets is part adult, part child. . . part muppet &#8212; a mish-mash that at once feels disjointed and unsatisfying and the pitch perfect conglomeration for exploring such subject matter. Am I making myself clear? Perhaps it is best said in song:</p>
<blockquote><p>I reflect on my reflection<br />
And I ask myself the question:<br />
What’s the right direction to go?<br />
I don’t know.<br />
Am I a man, or am I a Muppet?<br />
If I’m a Muppet then I’m a very manly Muppet.<br />
Am I a Muppet or am I a man?<br />
If I’m a man, that makes me a Muppet of a man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Am I a Muppet or a (wo)man?  Indeed.  A pretty heady question.</p>
<p>Jim Henson’s unique magic was a creative power that made anyone, of any age, feel the wonder of childhood. This latest movie further solidifies the fact that we can never replace him or his art. What Segel brings with his film is no Henson substitute, but something new with its own charm. From the fan’s perspective, he extends a thank you to Jim and Kermit and friends &#8212; one that valiantly tries to articulate paradoxical distances. One that says, “it’s been really hard growing up without you, even though I know you’ve been with me all along.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s probably few things that are as personal, as idiosyncratic, or as undeniable as what foods we like and what we don&#8217;t like. The word &#8220;disgusting&#8221; derives from the Middle French word for taste (<em>gouster</em>, now <em>goûter</em>), and even when we&#8217;re talking about something other than food, it evokes a deep, visceral sort of revulsion &#8212; something so bad that it makes one sick to one&#8217;s stomach. There are foods that we&#8217;re indifferent to, but that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about. I&#8217;m talking about those ordinary, everyday foods that we each, for whatever reason, find to be <em>disgusting</em>.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I didn&#8217;t think of myself as a picky eater, although I&#8217;m not sure my parents would have agreed. To this day, I&#8217;d still say there wasn&#8217;t much that I didn&#8217;t like, it was just that the things I didn&#8217;t like happened to be everywhere. Bananas (which I still hate, both in flavor and texture), tomatoes (which are a column of their own), and most inconveniently, cheese.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough to be a kid who doesn&#8217;t like cheese. I always tried to be flexible, but cheeseburgers are everywhere, and it&#8217;s not always easy for either parent or kid to extract a melted slice from both burger and bun. We&#8217;re all familiar with Vincent Vega&#8217;s wonder over the French version of the McDonald&#8217;s Quarter Pounder with Cheese, but Vincent never walked into a McDonald&#8217;s and tried to order a Quarter Pounder with Cheese with no cheese. Try it sometime. Just for fun. As long as you don&#8217;t care that the burger will come to you with cheese no matter what you think you&#8217;ve finally made the person behind the counter understand, it&#8217;ll be the most entertaining ten minutes of your day. You can&#8217;t just order a Quarter Pounder, you have to try to communicate somehow that you don&#8217;t want cheese on the thing. (Sure, you say, I could just get a Big Mac, but if my preferences were actually being consulted, I would have been in Burger King getting a Whopper. The McDLT eventually solved this problem, for a while, anyway.)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLtwFugudZE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Anyone who has ever tried to feed a child shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that my dislike of cheese wasn&#8217;t universal &#8212; pizza was never a problem &#8212; and when I was old enough to start to care, I tried to be consistent. I thought that if pizza wasn&#8217;t a problem, then it couldn&#8217;t be that I disliked all cheese. I tried Swiss and provolone, and sure enough, while neither had much to recommend itself, neither turned my stomach either. I learned to appreciate a mushroom Swiss burger, and to my surprise, found myself a fan of the spicy pepper jack cheeseburger that Wendy&#8217;s served for a short time. (Don&#8217;t ask me how I ended up trying that. I can&#8217;t even imagine. But it was pretty good.) By the time I graduated high school, my working theory was that I liked white cheeses &#8212; which tend to be milder &#8212; and that it was the stronger yellow cheeses that I didn&#8217;t like. A whole new world of food was opening up, but there was still a lot that I avoided.</p>
<p>And then, in college, one of my housemates looked at my eating habits and took pity on me. She and her roommate took turns cooking for each other, and once a week they let me join them. I&#8217;ve never been one to turn down free cooking, and being that I did so little to earn this meal, I ate whatever they put in front of me. In a matter of weeks, my sensible white cheese/yellow cheese dichotomy was turned upside down. Not only did I like cheddar and other yellow cheeses. I actually preferred a sharp cheddar to mild. When push comes to shove, I&#8217;m not always in love with the texture of raw cheese, but the flavor of a sharp cheddar was such that I didn&#8217;t care. Sliced, shredded, or melted, it was all wonderful. How could this possibly be?</p>
<p>After some reflection, I&#8217;ve pulled two lessons from this apparently illogical personal narrative. The first, is that tastes change. I remind myself of this when my own daughters decide suddenly that one of their favorite foods is no longer acceptable, and when my adventurous toddler turns into an arbitrarily picky elementary schooler. If I don&#8217;t always like the same things from day to day, then I have to expect the same from my children. All I can do is encourage them to keep trying things, and to do the same myself.</p>
<p>The second lesson was a bit less philosophical. When I was growing up, &#8220;cheese&#8221; meant a big block of Velveeta. This was used for everything from hamburgers to grilled cheese sandwiches. I&#8217;m not sure that actual cheddar had ever been in the house, just &#8220;pasteurized prepared cheese product.&#8221; It was never actually cheese that I disliked. It was Velveeta. I still think it&#8217;s disgusting. My daughters would probably love it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beverages have represented different things to me at various times in my life, and I find that my drink preferences can be easily broken down into clearly defined eras, each with its own, distinctive needs. Those needs were not always satiated, but boy, it didn’t stop me from trying using whatever was sloshing around in my glass.</p>
<p><strong>Dairy damsel: the early years</strong></p>
<p>Like most children, I drank cows’ milk. But growing up in Wisconsin, the land of milk and cheese, I drank it constantly &#8212; with meals and in-between. I lived a stone’s-throw from a number of dairy farms, and my local high school ran a yearly “bring your tractor to school day” for the Future Farmers of America students. The dairy farm nearest to my home also had veal cows penned right up against the road, where everyone could see. I saw tethered, baby veal cows most days of my first eighteen years of life.</p>
<p>During my childhood and adolescence, rBGH &#8212; also known as &#8220;recombinant bovine growth hormone&#8221; &#8212; was plentiful, unregulated, and pumped into milk at a record rate. I was consuming a great ton of milk then, and now I have a milkmaid figure and endometriosis. Just kidding &#8212; I’m sure neither is related. I hope.</p>
<p><strong>A fish called Wanda: the boozy years</strong></p>
<p>I was already a few years into sewing my recreational oats via other substances when something as unremarkable as alcohol began subverting it&#8217;s way into my repertoire with increasing rotations. I accessed it by the typical, teenage avenues at my disposal because I was eighteen; an age sometimes quite crudely referred to as &#8220;not old enough to drink, but old enough to swallow.&#8221; Soon I was chasing the day when I&#8217;d be able to down liquor that was not stolen, swindled, or combined from the ends of other people&#8217;s discarded drinks. In the meantime, I decided that drinking something I had just picked cigarette butts out of was part of my charm, and became a scavenger-goat for alcohol &#8212; a remora and bottom-feeder feasting on the booze scraps that of-age sharks had lost track of or left behind. When I had a choice or had convinced some poor sod to buy the man’s-ruin-fluid on my behalf, I opted for Bud Light, leaving me more calories for food, or Mad Dog, leaving me more money for things like gasoline and film developing. (These were the days before digital cameras.) By the time I moved on to straight vodka, whiskey and rum, I was almost old enough to buy it myself.</p>
<p>Eventually the way that I was drinking became less endearingly ribald and more&#8230; abject. So now I buy alcohol only infrequently, and then opt for indie beer with fancy labels, like a good little hipster. Although I will say that <em>Idler</em> music columnist and good buddy Mike Vincent recently turned me on to Dogfish brand beer, which is a slice of beer-heaven.</p>
<p><strong>Working stiff: the retail years</strong></p>
<p>So. Much. Coffee. This is when espresso finally made it to the midwest, so in fueling my lowly bookstore-assistant-manager positions, I graduated from giant, refillable styrofoam McDonald’s coffees to caffeine-loaded froo-froo drinks that came in matte, brown cups with the little corrugated condom-jackets. Somewhere along the way I switched back to plain black coffee again which was 1.) free at the independent bookstore I finally ended up at, and 2.) low-calorie, to correspond with the eating disorder I had developed not long after I stopped drinking like a sad lounge-singer.</p>
<p>In mid-high school, putting sugar and cream in my truck stop coffee like a silly, innocent teenager had been part of the fun in drinking it while I sat across from my friend <a href="http://theprojekt.artsprojekt.com/post/7655866383/artist-proof-interview-with-artist-kelly" target="_blank">Kelly Howlett</a> (who is now a painter and teacher), agreeing that being part of a creative community like the Beats would be totally swell. Cream and sugar lost their allure around the same time food did, and even though I now eat like a regular lady, I never really regained my taste for sweetened coffee. I still like my coffee black and bitter like a punch in the face &#8212; a reminder of where I came from, and the things I was forced to abandon to survive. Leave me my bitter coffee, oh irresponsiblity and excess, for you have already robbed me of so much.   </p>
<p><strong>Today and tonight: the writing years</strong></p>
<p>The combination of a slipshod lifestyle, a slavish debt to old demons, inherited predispositions and a wussy constitution has left me with rather cry-baby adrenals at age 34. I still drink coffee, but it’s a dysfunctional relationship to encourage. If I drink it, I don’t sleep. In fact, it’s 7:45 a.m. as I write this, and I haven’t been to bed yet tonight (uh, this morning?). I even took a little Rx downer at midnight to help motivate me to become tired, but I’m afraid that’s worn off now since it’s only supposed to last about six hours. Staying up all night to work is all too tempting when it’s work you care about, and when the words are coming easily like a new lover who thinks you’re something special.</p>
<p>When I am being responsible, I drink tea. It’s the perfect balance to give me enough pep to avoid passing out into my soup like a blitzed Montgomery Clift, but not so much that I stay up until eight a.m. trying to write my way out of whatever box I imagine I’m in. Fortunately, I love tea. When I was writing my novel <em>Basajaun</em>, I would drink a pot of green tea steadily throughout the day, and it kept me literarily lubricated and balanced, yet muted enough to remain still and produce. I view green tea as magical writing elixir, but for it to function effectively, I have to go into the day fresh, having slept the night before. That’s the bit that’s the stickler. When it gives you temporary results, it’s all too easy to pump your body with delicious, face-punching black coffee all for the sake of accomplishing work or avoiding the night. For Winkin’, Blikin’ and Nod &#8212; those rogue denizens of sleep &#8212; may not be as friendly when you’re heavily caffeinated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="It all ends" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.allwelike.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/harry-potter-4.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="427" />I haven’t read a word of the Harry Potter series. Not one word. My intentions to do so were fleeting and only arose once the people around me, the ones whose opinions I trust implicitly, began reading and recommending it to me. It all sounded good, but I was already three films deep at the time and those books are not short. In fact, nearly all of the films based on them clock in at well over two hours and I have yet to see one without someone complaining about something being left out.</p>
<p>So that ship had sailed. In all honesty, I almost didn’t get on board with the films either. Chris Columbus, director of <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em> (1987), <em>Home Alone</em> (1990) and <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em> (1993), is certainly competent, but he doesn’t exactly bring much to the table, and I was mostly underwhelmed by his interpretation of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em> (2001). It is a fine children’s film, but carries only a hint of what’s to come. He tackled the sequel, <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> (2002), with equal (lack of) flair and style. I was fond of Harry, but in the same way I’m fond of most of my extended family. “That was nice visit. See you in a few months.”</p>
<p>Then came Alfonso Cuaron, director of the fabulous Spanish film, <em>Y Tu Mama Tambien</em> (2001) and the third Harry Potter film, <em>The Prisoner of Azkaban </em>(2004). It was the first Potter flick I made a point of seeing in the theater. Call me a snob, but Cuaron’s name being mentioned lent a certain air of respect to what I had viewed as being largely children’s fare (albeit, better-than-average children’s fare). More mature, stylish and foreboding, <em>Azkaban</em> quickly became my favorite Potter film, establishing a vibe the series maintained throughout the rest of its impressive run.</p>
<p>Ever since <em>Azkaban</em> I have managed to see all but <em>Goblet of Fire (2005) </em>in theaters. The series has certainly become aesthetically brilliant, but the stories have matured as well. In fact, what’s most impressive to me about the Harry Potter series in general, aside from the engrossing story, aside from the large cast of unique, complicated characters, is the fact that J.K. Rowling has managed to craft a tale that has matured right along with its fan base. There are many Potterheads (is that a thing? If it isn’t, it should be) that started reading the series when they were young and, now in early adulthood, feel as though they have grown up with Harry and friends because, well, they have.</p>
<p>There is no better evidence of this than when Harry, gazing into the pensieve for the last time using Snape’s tear (I hear tell its brain matter or something in the book. I’m kind of okay with that change), sees visions of himself in the previous films. Even being what I would describe as a casual fan, it’s really something to take in what a journey these films (and books) have been for so many involved.</p>
<p>No, I have no plans to read the books now. I know how it ends. I have taken the trip, even with the inevitable shortcuts a film adaptation must take. I’m okay with that. I am not sad to see the series come to a close because all good things must come to an end, and Harry Potter and friends have a fine ending, indeed.</p>

<p>I was 11 years old when Superman died. I remember being at a rollerskating rink when when my mother told me. She had been reading a magazine article on the topic, and upon hearing that my favorite hero had &#8220;died&#8221; the week prior, my heart sunk in my chest. To make it worse, he was killed, beaten to death by a monster called Doomsday. Someone or something, had been strong enough to kill Superman with their bare hands. How was this possible? Of course, as a kid, I didn&#8217;t understand the marketing/scripting DC had planned for the story and that Superman would be back less than a year later. All I knew was that my favorite childhood superhero, the man I dressed up as for Halloween on numerous occasions, the man whose theme song (John Williams&#8217; classic score) made my heart race, was gone.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really collect comics at the time, but like many others kids my age, the story of Supes&#8217;s death had me begging my parents to take me to the nearest comic store ASAP. DC&#8217;s marketing team had certainly accomplished their goal. I did not, however, end up with a copy of <em>Superman</em> #75 like I wanted, and I didn&#8217;t know that Superman&#8217;s death actually came at the end of 7-issue series, most of which were selling out everywhere. These were the days before eBay, so this would have meant going to collectibles shops and paying ridiculous aftermarket prices driven up by hype. So, rather than buy me the single issue where Superman meets his end, my mother bought me the paperback collection of all seven issues later that year as a Christmas gift. The book was glued to my hands the rest of the day. Regardless of if I was at church or visiting relatives, I was really in Metropolis, hoping my hero would pull through even though the title of the book said he did not.</p>
<p>The series was a shock to my system. Never before had I seen so many superheroes together in one book fighting one villain. . . and losing. Doomsday, a mindless killing machine that had come out of nowhere, was tearing through the DC roster like the New England Patriots against a high school freshman squad. All my previous memories of comics villains involved complicated schemes or traps set to cause the heroes grief, but Doomsday was different. He didn&#8217;t think. He didn&#8217;t plan. He just beat the tar out of everyone, with the combined force of the Justice League and Superman barely enough to slow him down. As kid it was scary to behold.</p>

In hindsight it is easier to understand the criticisms some had of the series. The same things that made it appealing to me as a child made it off-putting to some older comic fans. A new villain, and a mostly one-dimensional one at that, was brought in rather than giving the victory to a long-standing rival like Lex Luthor. Comic deaths are almost always temporary, so many knew Supes would be back soon and the story was just a gimmick to sell books.</p>
<p>Personally, even as a adult, I don&#8217;t give much thought to such things. Even if the whole plot was devised as a way to sell books (isn&#8217;t that what DC is in the business of doing anyway?), I don&#8217;t really care. True, Doomsday was not a very deep villain, but the kid in me will always remember seeing him as the personification of pure hatred and evil, and Superman as his noble, altruistic, counter. To me, Doomsday did (and still does) represent all the raw negative traits of humanity when left unchecked. Superman is the good that we strive to be in our hearts. As a kid their battle only existed in the physical world, but as I grew I saw more to it. It is, perhaps, because of the lack the obvious complexities so many other comic characters possess that Superman vs Doomsday represents the internal struggle between the id and the super-ego so well. Their &#8220;purity&#8221; allows them to easily symbolize our primal wants and what we know is right.</p>

<p>In the second-to-last issue of the series, a bloodied and exhausted Superman defiantly declares that he will not allow Doomsday to go any further, saying &#8220;Metropolis is where I hold the line!&#8221; We all have an internal Metropolis, a line we will never cross, even if it means making huge sacrifices. While I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s unlikely that most people use fictional characters as representatives of their internal psyche, the adult me sees the obvious metaphor. This is nothing new to comic books, and similar themes were explored in the narrative of Chris Nolan&#8217;s film <em>The Dark Knight</em>. But for me, Superman did it first, and even though I didn&#8217;t see it or care as a kid, my changing perspective on the story as I have aged has worked as a litmus test for my ability to look past the superficial. <em>The Death of Superman</em> was not only the beginning of major changes in the DC Universe, it was the beginning of a hobby I continue to this day, so it will always have a special significance to me, even if that significance has changed over the years.</p>
<p>I did finally buy a copy of <em>Superman</em> #75. As an adult I found myself able to track down and afford a copy of the rare &#8220;Platinum Edition,&#8221; of which only 10,000 copies were ever made. I now own one of only 34 known copies in near mint condition. After getting it signed by the author/artist Dan Jurgens and re-graded, it is now one of only FIVE known copies in such condition. I keep it in my home office, as motivation to be best I can be, and as a reminder to never let go of the things that, as a kid, made me think I could fly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Child with camera" src="https://i1.wp.com/us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/lovleah/lovleah0701/lovleah070100055/728767-a-child-using-a-digital-video-camera-to-record-a-home-movie.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="240" />I have always had a problem with timelines. The events of my life, particularly my early years, ebb and flow. There are places, people and moments that remain very vivid to me, but placing it in time is another matter. It is because of this that I cannot pinpoint how old I was when I received the G.I Joe mobile command center. It was a rolling monstrosity that opened in the same tiered manner as a tool box to reveal a tri-level base of operations, complete with individual stations and rooms. It was the real deal, but I never actually played G.I. Joe with it. Not even once. I had darker plans for them.</p>
<div style="width: 256px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="    " title="G.I. Joe mobile command center" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.hisstank.com/forum/members/money-b-albums-targets-picture6208-mcc.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="184" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It could keep out COBRA commandos, but no one ever plans for parasitic aliens</p></div>
<p>Instead of staving off the tyranny of COBRA Commander and his army of aim-impaired flunkies, these Joes had to deal with the parasitic aliens that had infested their state-of-the-art plastic fortress, which now resided on some remote planet on the far side of the galaxy. They didn’t see it coming. They were torn limb from limb, exposing the little metal latches used to fasten the tiny, black rubber band that held their torso together. It was gruesome business, but when playing Aliens, I had to strive for authenticity.</p>
<p>Sometimes my Joes would find themselves deep in the jungle, relentlessly hunted by a ruthless Predator, other times by a cyborg Terminator in the heart of a post-apocalyptic city. Occasionally, they’d find themselves dragged to the bottom of a <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/08/the-horror-years/">Zombie Lake</a>, a fate I am not entirely proud of having reenacted.</p>
<div style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="Sarlacc pit" src="https://i1.wp.com/cdn.hahajk.com/uploads/2011/03/sarlacc.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="172" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The pits.</p></div>
<p>The boy across the street from me was an only child and, therefore, had the coolest swag. There wasn’t a Star Wars action figure he didn’t own and soon I found myself battling the Empire on his front lawn, and a hole created by a missing fence post stood in for the sarlacc pit. But when I received my own Millennium Falcon for Christmas it only ended up infested with those pesky parasitic aliens. I knew where my heart was.</p>
<p>As my film tastes matured, so did my reenactments. I had realized that my action figures couldn’t emote the way real people could. They couldn’t sling pistols like the Young Guns, or die in a blaze of Glory, crawling up the side of a fortress, American flag in hand.  I enlisted my friends, setting up scenarios that needed to be played out. I was already writing and directing.</p>
<p>All of my favorite childhood games became film recreations. When I was feeling ambitious, they were reimaginings. Either way, I remember strictly adhering to a strict three act structure during play time. There had to be a beginning, middle and end. I remember closing one eye, camera one, leaning in close and creating close-ups in my mind&#8217;s eye. In my head, I heard music swell. I was a strange lad, to be sure, but my film fandom was clear at an early age and it had already began to shape the way I told stories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day at the gym I looked up from my elliptical to the TV in time to catch grainy video footage of a skinny kid getting body slammed.  It was sickening.  I gasped in horror and was suddenly fuming with outrage over such senseless brutality.  </p>
<p>Bullying.  I was so upset and could only run faster to vent my frustration.  That poor boy got thrown to the ground and nobody helped him.</p>
<p>The next day I happened upon the rest of the story.  The boy who delivered the body slam, Casey Heynes,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KakZkh9Iu7U&amp;feature=related"> was defending himself</a>. I felt less sickened until I saw <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__IjcLVBBYc&amp;NR=1">this interview</a> with the other boy involved, Richard Gale.<br />
Richard says he has been bullied his whole life and that Casey started in on him first, calling him names, and Richard admits he overreacted.</p>
<p>Casey says he has been bullied his whole life and that Richard came up to him out of nowhere, started punching him and Casey says he finally snapped and body slammed him. Richard and Casey both claim they were just standing up for themselves and their fight has had me thinking in circles for days.</p>
<p>No one has the right to put their hands on you.  That kind of violation of personal space, to me, means entering into an implicit contract of “kick my ass if you can.” If it turns out the victim can, then the bully had it coming.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no one has the right to call you a name, either. </p>
<p>On the other, other hand, damaging though they can be, you can walk away from words.</p>
<p>On the other, other, other hand how much crap, verbal or physical, should someone have to put up with before exercising his or her right to take a stand?</p>
<p>Casey has become something of a hero. He has been soundly applauded by many: <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ9AscQA6ug">strangers on YouTube</a>, high profile women of <em>The View</em>, even <em>Penny Arcade</em> gave him <a target="new" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/3/18/">a heartfelt shout-out</a>.  This has a lot of people talking about bullying and victims’ rights, which is important. Perhaps all the talk will help teach those who need to be taught about what it means to be a bully and the importance of self-defense.</p>
<p>I will admit that when I learned the body slam was in self-defense I felt somehow relieved.  There was at least a reason for the brutality.  But then I got upset again.  Casey had every right to stick up for himself and I know when a person is that angry he isn’t really thinking about the consequences of his actions, but he could have paralyzed or even killed Richard.</p>
<p>The one fistfight I was ever involved in nearly ended so badly.  It was between my sister and me when we were eight and six, over Barbies, I’m ashamed to say.  Sister at eight years old dominated the fight, but she didn’t count on the strength I could conjure when fueled by rage.  I threw her down, hogtied her with a jump rope and pushed her into our closet.  When she didn’t stop crying, I pushed a pillow into her face.</p>
<p>Six-year-old me knew I was doing something very bad.  Suffocation had been explained to me.  Of course, at that young age I had no real concept of the finality of death and I had the arrogant confidence of a child that I would never be capable of such a terrible thing.  To this day I’m mortified by how badly that fight could have ended. My mother was, of course, furious with me and I was in mega-tons of trouble, but sister got into just as much trouble for pushing me to the point of being so angry I would do something like that to her.  We were both punished and learned that fighting doesn’t solve anything.</p>
<p>But I also have to admit that watching the video made me feel avenged.  I was bullied all through 7th grade by a group of absolutely beastly 8th grade girls.  The abuse was mostly verbal and psychological.  It was exhausting.  My locker was ulcer-inducingly close to theirs.  We had a class together and ended up having to sit next to each other. Among other things I endured their stares, taunts about my fashion sense and lack of sexual allure (because that’s so effing important in 7th grade), and name-calling.  Every morning my alarm was like a starter’s pistol for my own personal race of “get through the day unscathed” and every morning I wanted to die just so I wouldn’t have to go to school.  The one time I “stood up” for myself by telling one of the girls antagonizing me to shut up ended with me getting pushed in front of the lunch room crowd.  I didn’t push back.  I didn’t get a chance to.  The girl who pushed me, someone rumored to have kicked many an ass before, got her push in and then stormed off while she and her friends laughed.  </p>
<p>Adult me is ashamed of teenage me.  </p>
<p>I have a temper and I have snapped before (just ask my sister), but I didn’t then.</p>
<p><em>I let someone put her hands on me and I didn’t do anything.</em> If there was ever a time in my life I should have absolutely lost my temper and gone into a bat-crazy rage it should have been then, but I was too scared.  There is a part of me that feels a little bit better when I watch Casey’s retaliation.</p>
<p>But then I’m sad for Richard again.  He says he was a victim, too.  It must have taken a lot of courage to stand up to someone of Casey’s stature and it ended badly.  Worse, it’s all over the internet and people are telling him he’s just as bad a terrorist and he’s going to burn in hell. (I thought bullying was wrong?)</p>
<p>The bullying, it seems, will never end one way or the other.</p>
<p>I hope Casey doesn’t spend the rest of his school career or his life getting challenged by even bigger, more loathsome assholes.  “Aren’t you that guy who body slammed that kid? Think you can take me?”  I hope that despite all this media attention he can still walk away and just be a well-adjusted kid.</p>
<p>I hope Richard will be able to escape the stigma of villain that has been imposed upon him.  No one really knows for sure exactly what happened before that camera began recording.  I’m sure he felt justified in his actions at the time. I hope he can learn from this and find better ways of coping with any future altercations and be another well-adjusted kid.</p>
<p>I hope this can all, somehow, be a positive turning point for both boys.  I hope they can begin to feel empowered to speak up for themselves as well as others.  I hope they can sleep better at night and wake up happy in the morning.</p>

My sister and I enjoyed it as children and I couldn&#8217;t resist throwing it in my queue. It was as I remembered it, but with my adult outlook I found the story to be really awful for young children. It’s chock full of sin. The Seven Deadlies even.</p>
<p>1. <strong>SLOTH</strong><br />
We begin with Rumpelstiltskin deciding he needs a child to cook and slave for him because he doesn’t want to do it himself. Only a prince&#8217;s son will do.</p>
<p>We are introduced to Katie, the miller’s daughter as she sings of her aspirations for nothing other than to marry a prince so she can be queen, lounge around all day, and have nice things.</p>
<p>2. <strong>PRIDE</strong><br />
Once it’s established Katie has no redeeming qualities other than her beauty, her father lies about her ability to spin straw into gold. (Beautiful AND magical, you say?  Well, damn!)  This rumor reaches the king who calls the miller and Katie to court to discover the truth.  When asked for the truth (several times, by the way) neither Katie or her father take the opportunity to say, &#8220;Sorry, we were tellin&#8217; tales out of school.&#8221;  Katie goes along with it to save face. (Fantastic message for kids: Be a follower and let others speak for you.  It’s totally okay if you’re pretty)</p>
<p>3. <strong>GLUTTONY</strong>, and 4. <strong>ENVY</strong><br />
Katie is tested on her “skills.”  Decapitation awaits if she doesn&#8217;t spin a bale of straw into gold threads by dawn.  Mr. &#8216;Stiltskin shows up and offers to perform this task for the price of whatever shiny trinket she might have.  Katie pays him a gold necklace her mother gave her. (She has no sentimentality!)  While this is the only moral part of the story&mdash;someone getting paid for their labor&mdash;it seems futile when we take into consideration that he really has no use for gold necklaces when he can spin gold whenever he wants. (I’ve got PILES of gold at home, but, yeah, gimme that woman’s necklace.) Clearly he plots to take something else from Katie.</p>
<p>5. <strong>GREED</strong><br />
Katie passes her test but is asked to do it again, this time with more straw because the queen doesn&#8217;t believe her, and the king wants more gold.  Why?  He explains in his song, &#8220;I&#8217;m Greedy.&#8221; (That was a freebie)</p>
<p>For a second time the evil elf comes to the rescue, this time taking Katie&#8217;s gold ring. Again, this is silly.</p>
<p>The third time Katie is tested she hasn&#8217;t anything left to give to Rumplestiltzkin who tells her he&#8217;ll help her again if she promises to give him her first-born child (Envy again. THAT’S how you acquire a prince’s son. Take notes, guys) and she agrees. (What sin does selling your unborn child fall under?)  But who can blame her?  If the straw is spun into gold THIS time she&#8217;ll get to marry her prince and be a princess and then queen like she&#8217;s always wanted. So what&#8217;s one baby?</p>
<p>6. <strong>LUST</strong><br />
Katie gets hitched and knocked up.  I know, it’s a fairy tale and there was official wedlock involved, but the prince “fell in love” with Katie based on her looks and the fact that she managed not to get her head chopped off, so I’m counting it. (You’re pretty and you’re not dead? Excellent!  You’ll do!)</p>
<p>7. <strong>WRATH</strong><br />
Rumpelstiltskin returns to claim his payment of one prince’s son, at which point Katie goes back on her word claiming, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what I was saying!&#8221; and refuses to give up her baby. (Way to get off your ass and do some parenting, lady)  Mr. ‘Stiltskin takes pity on her once more stating if she can guess his name he’ll call it off.  Through no cleverness of her own (a bird tells the name to a mute servant girl, who suddenly finds her voice&mdash;turns out she just had to try really hard&mdash;and informs Katie), Katie discovers his name.  Rumpelstiltskin becomes furious, stomps his foot until the floor opens and he falls into the fires below. </p>
<p>Flimsy comparisons perhaps, but I&#8217;m surprised my sister and I didn&#8217;t turn out worse watching this sinful movie full of sinning sinners. Katie and her lying father never answer for their lies and are implied to live happily ever after.  However, if we are to take this movie to heart, remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working is for chumps (and children, apparently)</li>
<li>Be pretty and find a rich man to marry</li>
<li>Lie about your talents to make yourself seem more interesting</li>
<li>Delegate challenging tasks to those better suited for the work</li>
<li>Marry for looks and the ability to make fortunes at home</li>
<li>Children are expendable, until they&#8217;re not</li>
<li>Promises were made to be broken</li>
<li>The fires of hell are just a crack in the floor away</li>
</ul>
