										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first moved to California, I had completely unrealistic expectations about the weather. I expected it to be beach weather at all times, with no need for socks or jackets or anything practical. As it turns out, my sense of geography is terrible and California is bigger than I realized, with climates to match. Near us, outside San Francisco, it became apparent that winter actually still happens. Not the painful sub-zero wind chill, dig your car out of the snow, wet-hair-freezing kind of cold that I grew up with, but rainy and windy and cold enough for scarves. Very slowly the days have been warming, but it feels like the same eternity as when you’re sitting in your frozen car waiting for the heat to kick in.</p>
<p>Last weekend, the temperature shot up to a record-breaking, unseasonably warm 85 degrees, and I went into full-on summer break mode. I slept with the window open; woke up gleeful as if SCHOOL’S OUT FOR THE SUMMER, did my work in sundresses, and froze orange juice to make popsicles. As with everything, I wanted to celebrate with food. Ever since I ate all my Easter candy, the kitchen was back to its usual sad, no-sweets state. But with the heat, the last thing I wanted to do was crank up the oven.</p>
<p>Instead, I found a recipe for a <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/summer-recipe-nobake-strawberr-117900" target="_blank">no-bake strawberry icebox cake</a>. I’d never heard of such a thing, but basically, the refrigerator does all the work for you. I was tempted to make the 9&#8243; x 12&#8243; cake the recipe called for, but instead I halved the recipe so that Charlie and I would survive to enjoy the warm weather. I had most of the ingredients already (I left out the rosewater, because when the fuck else am I going to use rosewater?), but picked up some strawberries and whipping cream. The most time-consuming part of this recipe was slicing the strawberries. I took my knife and cutting board to the couch and worked while I watched <em>Battlestar Galactica </em>episodes.</p>

<p>A very sharp knife makes the thin slicing easy. Next, I measured out the whipping cream. I guess that, in order to make homemade whipped cream, all you have to do is whip the shit out of the cream for five minutes. My hand mixer is messed up and only runs on a very high speed, so I grew concerned while I whipped and whipped the cream. I don’t understand the chemistry of it, and I had no idea how whipping something that looked fairly liquid would make whipped cream, but eventually, lo and behold, the cream started to stiffen.</p>
<p>The recipe said to whip until the cream held “stiff peaks,” meaning if you scoop a bit out, the tip doesn’t flop over.</p>

<p>Miraculously, it worked. I added a little vanilla and powdered sugar, and I had an effing delicious homemade whipped cream. I&#8217;m in danger of becoming the sort of person who refuses to buy Cool Whip because it&#8217;s nowhere near as good as the homemade kind.</p>
<p>Next, I opened the package of graham crackers. I bought the reduced-fat kind because the word “whipping cream” was upsetting to me, health-wise. As if the two would balance each other out. (They didn’t.) I layered the graham crackers, whipped cream, then the strawberries.</p>

<p>By the time I reached the last two layers, I realized that I’d been too stingy with the whipped cream on the first two layers, and compensated by making a very top-heavy cake. To make the chocolate ganache, all you do is heat up a little of the whipping cream, mix it with some chocolate (I used semi-sweet baking chocolate), and drizzle it on. Even though I halved the rest of the recipe, I didn’t bother halving the amount of ganache.</p>

<p>Then, I slid the gorgeous thing into the refrigerator and left it there overnight. After breakfast the next morning, Charlie and I cut slices for our second breakfast. The cake had softened in the refrigerator overnight, so the graham crackers sliced easily with a butter knife. The ganache had hardened, making it look super fancy.</p>

<p>I cannot express to you how delicious it was. In the refrigerator, everything had softened into a sort of tiramisu-like texture, but without being mushy or soggy. It was light (despite the whipping cream) without being too sweet. The chocolate added just a little bit of richness without being too overwhelming. I never knew what made ganache in bakery desserts so tasty, but it turns out it&#8217;s the whipping cream.</p>
<p>I plan to take this to all future potlucks because it looks impressive and will make me look cool, but is SUPER easy to make. The cake didn’t last two days &#8212; I wasn’t even able to wait until after dinner the next day and ate it after lunch instead. You could probably make this with any fruit and it would be amazing &#8212; fresh nectarines or raspberries are next on my list. And next time I’ll know better and will make a full-sized cake.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My mom is coming to Boston to celebrate my birthday. The other day, she texted me to ask what my favorite meal was. I don’t care how old you are, there is nothing like having your mother cook for you to redeem your faith in the world. But her question made me realize that I didn’t have an answer. What <em>is</em> my favorite meal? For the amount of time I spend with food on the brain, you’d think I’d at least have a favorite meal. But I don’t. I thought for a long time, and the only thing I could think of was pesto anything. And mashed potatoes. (When I was younger, I used to say Ponderosa was my favorite restaurant because it was a buffet and I could get as much mashed potatoes as I wanted. It’s a shame Ponderosas have mostly gone out of business, because I don’t think my culinary palette has advanced all that much and also I just came up with a great idea for my birthday.)</p>
<p>But the thing is, choosing a favorite meal is like choosing a favorite book. Impossible. There are far too many choices and I keep discovering new things I like, and if I choose one thing, I’ll feel bad for all the things I didn’t choose. I’d prefer to love food indiscriminately. (Except onions. They can go to hell.) I always feel lucky that I was born into a family where I never need to be hungry, and my biggest decision is whether to cook something at home or go out. <em>Such</em> a hard life. That doesn’t mean I should stuff my face with whatever I see, but my life is pretty much a delicious buffet.</p>
<p>That’s why I’d like to write about women and disordered eating. I’m not talking about anorexia or bulimia or binge eating or other words that doctors use. I’m talking about women who eat nothing close to three square meals each day, women for whom eating is an afterthought, something they barely remembered to check off their to-do list. For them, food is not nourishing, filling, or enjoyable. It’s a single piece of toast for breakfast, a handful of crackers for lunch, and a low-fat yogurt when she thinks she might pass out.  She doesn’t have time for lunch, so she eats a protein bar. When dinnertime comes and she’s still at work, she eats another and pretends not to notice how it leaves her hungry. It’s an instant coffee with lots of sugar that makes her feel full, so it’s four in the afternoon before she realizes she’s eaten nothing else. I feel like I could break them if I pushed with one finger; they would crumble into a thousand tiny pieces like a spun-sugar bottle.</p>
<p>They make excuses. Allergies. Upset stomach. Time. Not hungry. Always an excuse, always a reason to torture your body, your heart, and to give yourself the barest minimum. I know that some people have sensitive digestive systems and/or allergies and have to be careful—my own mom is dealing with allergies to yeast and all sorts of fruit that she loves, and it makes it impossible to eat almost everything. But ladies, please. That is not eating. That is not food.</p>
<p>I understand the temptation. I’ve made those excuses. Sometimes, I’ve been so busy at work I’ve forgotten to eat lunch and ended up eating peanut butter out of the jar. I got home very late from work a few days ago and was so hungry I ate cereal, hummous and pretzels, and ice cream. Not food. It’s a sort of punishment for not getting things done fast enough or well enough. It’s a punishment for being too stressed to plan and cook a meal. Why treat yourself? You didn’t do anything to deserve it. But eating that way only makes me feel worse. A real meal is a balm like nothing else, smoothing over all those hurting places. Even if we’re trying to be skinny or something, ladies, is it really worth it? There’s so much <em>food</em> we’re missing out on while we munch away on SlimFast bars.</p>
<p>One of my favorite columnists, <a href="http://therumpus.net/2011/02/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-64/">Sugar</a>, in a letter to her 22-year-old self, puts it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stop worrying about whether you’re fat. You’re not fat. Or rather, you’re sometimes a little bit fat, but who gives a shit? There is nothing more boring and fruitless than a woman lamenting the fact that her stomach is round. Feed yourself. Literally. The sort of people worthy of your love will love you more for this, sweet pea.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please, friends, feed yourselves. None of this protein bar bullshit. Please, be good to yourselves. You deserve better than that.</p>
<p>This weekend, I’m headed out to my aunts’ house with my mom. It’s a celebration. I can’t wait to eat. I hope they make me mashed potatoes, and I also hope to eat a lot of motherfucking cake (and I’ll share if you’ll let me). Happy birthday to me.</p>
