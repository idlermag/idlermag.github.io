										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have I mentioned that there are too many Best Picture nominees? <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">Has that come up before</a>? I digress. Once again find myself a few movies shy of the full category. And although I did manage to sneak <em>The Help</em> in at the buzzer &#8211; too late for an article &#8211; I was unable to get to<em> Hugo</em>, <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em> (Does having read the book count? And how about if I didn’t like it?) and <em>Warhorse</em>. <em>C&#8217;est la vie</em>.</p>
<p>I had convinced myself pretty early on that this was a bit of a down year. Having seen most of the films now I think that that was an unfair assessment. A few words that come to mind now are charming, insightful, sweet, and nostalgic. This may not have been a “down” year, <em>per se</em>, but it was certainly a pretty mellow one. It should also be noted that these are words one might use to describe a grandparent.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="The Artist" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/TheArtistSq.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Artist</em> wins Best Picture 2012</p></div>
<p>This year’s award show came and went without many surprises.  Out of the films that I did manage to get to I could make a pretty solid argument for at least three of them winning Best Picture, <em>The Artist</em> being one of them. I wouldn’t have minded <em>The Descendants</em> taking it, but I feel like it was too humble to stand out, and <em>The Tree of Life</em> could’ve taken it on sheer scale alone (It’s a film about EVERYTHING!).</p>
<p>All told, I’m happy with most of the victors. It does seem to be a real shame that Viola Davis didn’t take home Best Actress, but she’ll get hers one day. Meryl Streep is certainly one of the best of our time, but I’ve not heard a great many good things about <em>The Iron Lady</em>, and historically speaking acting awards tend to go to great performances in great (or at least very good) films. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/23/147291130/most-oscar-voters-are-white-male-out-of-touch">Perhaps not being entirely on the Academy’s radar demographic-wise</a> hurt Viola a little bit?</p>
<p>And where was the Best Supporting nomination for Albert Brooks in <em>Drive</em>?! Aside from that film being one of my favorites of the year, Brook’s villainy is pretty epic in it and I’m reasonably certain no one would have missed Nick Nolte’s name on that list. He’s very good in <em>Warrior</em>, but let’s face it; he’s played that character before.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest travesty for me, though, was the fact that <em>The Tree of Life’s</em> cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, didn’t go home with the gold. Yes, <em>Hugo</em> looks amazing, but I have never seen a film that looks or feels anything like <em>The Tree of Life</em>. Never. I don’t know about you, but I can’t think of a better impetus for handing someone an award.</p>
<p>It’s funny, this year I didn’t find myself terribly concerned about missing the few Best Picture noms that I did. Would I have rather seen <em>Hugo</em> than <em>The Help</em> (my wife is largely responsible for that)? Absolutely. But do I feel that I’ve missed out on <em>Extremely Loud</em> and <em>Warhorse</em>? Not really. Which brings us full circle: Were their really nine films worthy of being considered Best Picture? Can anyone give me a solid reason why <em>Extremely Loud</em>, a film hovering just under 50% on rottentomatoes.com, was even mentioned in the same breath as some of these other films? Oh well, it’s all over and done with now. And I’m reasonably certain that I’ll have another opportunity to rail on about this again next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignright" title="The Artist poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/the-artist-poster-wins__oPt.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="324" />The Artist</em> is a much cheekier film than I had expected going in, because as much as it strives for (and attains) authenticity it also spends a good deal of time winking at those who don’t like (or at least think they don’t like) silent films.</p>
<p>Its story is a sort of mash-up of <em>Singing in the rain</em> (1952) and <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> (1950) &#8212; the first being a film about the inception of the “talkie” and a young starlet who makes it big because she has a better voice than the current big name (a less squeaky one, at least), and the latter being about a washed-up silent film star left behind by her former industry to go mad in solitude. Admittedly, <em>The Artist</em> functions much better when it’s closer to the former, but the winks help with the latter.</p>
<p>These “winks” that I keep mentioning mostly come in the form of melodrama, especially towards the end, which gets to be a bit. . . much. But there are also a few clever uses of sound here and there. Hearing Jean Dujardin’s thick, French accent at the film&#8217;s end is especially fun.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dujardin, the casting is phenomenal. None of the actors, even the highly recognizable ones (John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, James Cromwell), feel out of place. But man, does Dujardin look at home in black and white! Roger Ebert described him as a cross between Sean Connery and Gene Kelly, which is pretty apropos. Berenice Bejo as the plucky young Peppy Miller doesn’t do half bad herself, with her winning smile and perfectly placed (by Dujardin, in fact) beauty mark.</p>
<p>So the order for the day here seems to be charm. There isn’t a second of <em>The Artist</em> that isn’t charming in one way or another. But can a film win a Best Picture Oscar on charm alone?</p>
<p><strong>The Artist<em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin), Best Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo), Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Costume Design, Best Directing, Best Editing, Music (original score) &amp; Best original Screenplay</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><img class="alignright" title="Moneyball poster" src="https://i0.wp.com/collider.com/wp-content/uploads/moneyball-poster.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="386" />“It’s hard not to be romantic about baseball”<br />
&#8212; Billy Beane</p></blockquote>
<p>Many great things have been said about the game of baseball (and a few silly things, too &#8212; Just Google Yogi Berra), but the above quote wraps it all up nicely and puts a bow on top. I would argue that you’d be hard-pressed to find a sport where even a regular season game, especially one early in the season, could hold as much drama as baseball. Bennett Miller’s <em>Moneyball</em> opens with a playoff loss and closes with one, but it focuses on a record-setting winning streak during the Oakland A’s 2002 regular season.</p>
<p>Beane, played by Brad Pitt, attributes the season’s winning ways to a team-building system devised by a night watchman at a pork and beans cannery named Bill James, now an advisor for the Boston Red Sox. James’ theory is that you choose players based on specific skill sets regardless of their perceived worth and overall talent. Beane is introduced to this system by a young Yale grad named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill).</p>
<p>Of course everyone thinks that Beane’s lost his. . . beans. But the wins begin to pile up, and you can’t argue with wins. Well, I suppose you can. Even Beane states that he won’t be truly satisfied until they’ve won it all. Even then he’d probably just want to do it again.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time with Billy Beane off the field, which is easy because we’re told that superstition prevents him from watching the games on television, let alone live. He is a doting father and an honest, hard-working guy who doesn’t take himself too seriously. I was thoroughly impressed by how well Pitt was able to disappear into the character and contribute to Beane&#8217;s high level of likeability. If you had asked me beforehand whether or not I would expect a potential award-winning performance from him I would have said no, but there it is.</p>
<p><em>Moneyball</em> is cleverly written (<em>The Social Network</em> writer Aaron Sorkin was involved, after all), well-directed and perfectly acted. The only real question is whether or not it is too quiet to stand out in the crowd. Well, if the montage of Oakland’s 20-win streak doesn’t get them, then I just don’t know what would have.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moneyball</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brad Pitt), Best Supporting Actor (Jonah Hill), Film editing, Sound Mixing &amp; Best Adapted Screenplay</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em><img class="alignright" title="Midnight in Paris poster" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/midnight-in-paris.jpg?w=229&#038;h=329" alt="" width="229" height="329" />If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a movable feast</em><br />
&#8212; Ernest Hemingway</p></blockquote>
<p>I have been lucky enough to have visited Paris twice in my life (so far) &#8212; once on a back-backing trip and once on my honeymoon. It is an easy city to be romantic in, but it’s even easier to be romantic about, and Woody Allen’s latest film, <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, is an hour-and-a-half love letter to the city, art, literature and creativity itself.</p>
<p>There is always a “Woody Allen character” in Woody Allen films, and this go-round his name is Gil and he’s played by Owen Wilson, displaying a kind of youthful exuberance I haven’t seen from Wilson since <em>Bottle Rocket</em> (1996). He’s travelled to Paris with his wife-to-be (Rachel McAdams) and future in-laws on a business trip, and this is not his first visit. No matter how hard he tries, he simply cannot get anyone to comprehend the beauty and amazement he sees all around him in the city of lights. They are more interested in stuffy dinners and shopping. His wife seems to be more interested in spending time with the laughably pretentious Paul (Michael Sheen), a family “friend.”</p>
<p>Gil often finds himself wandering the streets alone, which I’m sure he prefers. One night, unable to find his way back to his hotel, Gil is picked up by a mysterious cab full of revelers on their way to a party. Two of the revelers turn out to be F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda. It isn’t long before Gil, an aspiring novelist, is hanging with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Pablo Picasso. Allen makes little effort to explain this flight of fancy, and the film is better for it. One evening, while chilling at Gertrude Stein’s home, Gil meets Adriana, a mistress of Pablo Picasso’s. They immediately hit it off and, in finding real romance, Gil begins to question himself and his life choices.</p>
<p>But enough about that.</p>
<p>This movie is really about Paris and the romance it inspires, and in that regard it is hugely successful. If this film doesn’t make you want to pack your bags then I’ve got nothing for you. Its literary and film references are clever (the gag where Gil suggests that Luis Bunuel make a film about a bunch of bourgeoisie people having dinner together and then finding that they can’t leave the room is a personal fav), but not so esoteric as to lose everybody, and the jazz soundtrack really seals the deal. A beautiful film set in a beautiful city. Will that be enough?</p>
<p><strong><em>Midnight in Paris</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best original Screenplay &amp; Best Art Direction</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="The Tree of Life poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/collider.com/wp-content/uploads/the_tree_of_life_movie_poster_01.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="336" />Terrence Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em> is a difficult film. It speculates, but does not clearly state. It admires a mother’s warm smile, the smallness of a newborn in its father’s arms, and the cosmic ballet of the universe as one in the same. In short, it is a film about everything, and it is just as grand in scale as you’d expect such a film to be. But the grandiose is presented only as context for the intimate, the little things that shape us, and that’s what makes this a Best Picture nominee.</p>
<p>I’ll admit to initially being turned off a bit by the aforementioned cosmic ballet, the birth of life, the dinosaurs (yes, there are dinosaurs). It all seems a bit much. But when the film began to settle on the O’Brien family, circa 1950, it all started to fall into place. Everything about this family &#8212; the film’s center &#8212; feels stunningly authentic and lovingly rendered. Sunlight poring in through windows, glasses of lemonade served in plastic cups with flowers on them.</p>
<p>We learn a great deal about this family with very little dialogue. We learn that the family has lost a son. We learn that the eldest of the remaining two boys (played as an adult by Sean Penn) resents his father’s affection towards his younger brother. Sometimes the father (Brad Pitt) is a little hard on the boys. His wife (Jessica Chastain) is warm and forgiving.</p>
<p>A great deal of time is spent with the boys running, jumping, and skinning their knees. It’s enough to make anyone who grew up in a middle- to lower-middle-class suburban family wistful. They make mistakes and learn things about themselves. They mature. The film is filled with whispered narration, “Mother, Father. Always you wrestle inside me. Always you will.”</p>
<p>Malick marvels at the world around him and how everything means everything (or nothing at all). He senses a bigger picture, but it’s too grand to put a finger on. There is a certain level of spirituality in the film&#8217;s final moments, Sean Penn surrounded by those he knew and loved on a beach, a white door leading to. . . somewhere. But one could certainly go the other way with it, acknowledging that we are the sum total of those who have touched us along the way.</p>
<p><em>The Tree of Life</em> might be too big and too difficult to win it all this year. Or perhaps that’s precisely why it could? I suppose it all depends on whether or not the Academy is willing to reward a film for attempting to reach so far even if it can’t always grasp anything?</p>
<p><strong><em>The Tree of Life</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Cinematography &amp; Directing</strong></p>

To most of us, it’s not a place where people live and certainly not where anyone dies. My wife even remarked during the opening minutes of Alexander Payne’s <em>The Descendants</em> that it was strange to see office buildings through Matt King’s (George Clooney) own office window. “I didn’t know they had those there!” This, surely, cannot be Hawaii? But it is, and people do die there.</p>
<p>Matt King is, as a matter of fact, waiting for his wife to die after she has slipped into a coma caused by a jet skiing head injury. He has been told that there is nothing anyone can do now. His job is to tell everyone else, starting with his two daughters. The youngest, Scottie (Amara Miller), is already acting out in school, and her older sister Alex (Shailene Woodley) seems to have been her mentor. To make matters worse, Matt’s family has been locked in a fierce debate about how best to unload a plot of land handed down to them by their royal Hawaiian ancestors, and he gets to make the final call. Did I mention that <em>The Descendants</em> is also funny? It is. Not laugh out loud funny, no, but it does contain the kind of humor one uses to relieve impossible stress. In short, it is always funny right when it needs to be.</p>
<p>Like when Alex drops a bombshell on Matt’s bombshell, informing him that the reason she and her mother had not been speaking before the accident was because Alex had discovered her mother was having an affair. Okay, that’s not so funny. But the sight of Matt slipping on his man-dals and running down the street to confront his wife’s best friend about the affair sure is. He gets the other man’s name and the subsequent search provides a fine opportunity for Alex and Matt to bond. (Teenage girls love drama, don’t they?)</p>
<p>There are some nice moments involving peripheral characters. Matt’s father-in-law, for example, uses his daughter&#8217;s impending death as an excuse to unload all of the disappointing thoughts he has ever had about his son-in-law. And when his wife’s lover&#8217;s wife (wha?) shows up at the hospital Matt is sympathetic. None of this is really about him anyway. The only real fly in the ointment is a friend Alex drags along for the trip. Sure, they explain his presence well enough, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that the film wouldn&#8217;t have missed him.</p>
<p>And what of Matt’s struggle over his family’s decision to unload their land? Land that, in his own words, they did “nothing to earn?” It appears to comes not only from his desire to save a place he has enjoyed with his own immediate family, but from a deep respect for his family’s history. They say that death is for the living. They say that it can put things into perspective. I think that Matt and his daughters would most certainly agree.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Descendants</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best actor in a leading role (George Clooney), Directing (Alexander Payne), Film Editing (Kevin Tent) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the nominations have finally come out and I find myself even further behind than <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">last year</a>. I have seen a total of two of the Best Picture noms, one of the Best Actor, and an impressive ZIPPO of the Best Actress. The supporting categories are even worse. Even cinematography, a favorite category of mine, finds me at a pathetic 1 of 5!</p>
<p>Still, I look forward to this <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">mad dash every year</a>, despite the unnecessary amount of stress I always end up placing on myself.</p>
<p>In the three weeks leading up to the Oscars, I plan to review each film and state its case, culminating in my personal pick for Best Film and my prediction for the actual winner (the twain almost never meet).</p>
<p>I mean seriously, I did this even before I had <em>The Idler</em> as a venue! It&#8217;s a sickness, that&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve knocked out <em>The Tree of Life</em> and <em>The Descendants</em>. Both films are absolutely worthy nominees, but the rest of the category appears to be far more hit or miss. <em>The Artist</em> looks amazing and I hear that that is indeed the case, and I&#8217;ve been pretty excited for <em>Hugo</em> since its announcement. <em>Midnight in Paris</em> looks incredibly charming and Moneyball seems like a pretty solid, sports drama. <em>Warhorse</em>&#8216;s story doesn&#8217;t exactly light my fire, but it sure looks pretty, and that&#8217;s something. The two wild cards are <em>The Help</em> and <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em>. Both carry a definite stigma for me (Oscar Schmaltz), so we shall see.</p>
<p>I look forward to <em>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy </em>mostly due to its look (See: elegant), as I hear that it&#8217;s nearly incomprehensible story-wise. I have no doubt that Oldman will be fascinating. I have yet to see <em>Beginners</em>, but I have read the script and it brought me to tears (Because it was good). I needn&#8217;t hear of Oscar nominations to watch anything David Fincher makes, but it&#8217;s a good excuse to get to <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> (If the title sequence doesn&#8217;t pump you up for the flick then I just don&#8217;t know what to tell you!).</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcp9Ysi75f0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>At any rate, there&#8217;s a race to run and I am already out of breath!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Best Cinematography:</strong> Matthew Libatique for <em>Black Swan</em>, Wally Pfister for <em>Inception</em>, Danny Cohen for <em>The King’s Speech</em>, Jeff Cronenweth for <em>The Social Network</em>, Roger Deakins for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="True Grit" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/truegrit.gif?w=297&#038;h=198" alt="" width="297" height="198" />My pick:</strong> Roger Deakins for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong>Probable winner:</strong>Jeff Conenweth for <em>The King’s Speech</em></p>
<p><em>Black Swan</em>&#8216;s gritty, realistic visuals provide a striking counterpoint to the madness it contains and Cohen’s use of wide angle lenses and tight close-ups in <em>The King’s Speech</em> make for a unique looking film within a pretty traditional genre. <em>The Social Network</em>&#8216;s look is dark, ambient and cold (in a good way). I’m not sure <em>Inception</em>&#8216;s greatness owes much to the cinematography, but it’s a well-shot film to be sure.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The King's Speech" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/rpowell/pic/001c70t7/s640x480" alt="" width="307" height="205" />Even though I don’t often condone giving an artist an award for past work (unless we’re talking about a lifetime achievement award, of course), Roger Deakins really is about due. I won’t waste time listing all of his work but he’s shot one gorgeous film after another in his <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005683/">long career</a> including nearly every Coen brothers film since <em>Barton Fink</em> in 1991. <em>True Grit</em> is beautiful, subtle and by far my favorite in this category. Jeff Cronenweth will take it.</p>
<p><strong>Best Directing:</strong> Darren Aronofsky for <em>Black Swan</em>, David O. Russell for <em>The Fighter</em>, Tom Hooper for <em>The King’s Speech</em>, David Fincher for <em>The Social Network</em>, Joel &amp; Ethan Coen for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="The Social Network" src="https://i0.wp.com/clothesonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/The-Social-Network_Jesse-Eisenberg-dressing-gown_Image-credit-Columbia-Pictures.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192" />My pick: </strong>David Fincher</p>
<p><strong>Probable winner</strong>: David Fincher</p>
<p>Darren Aronovsky’s commitment to the madness is admirable and Tom Hooper’s unique style adds much to <em>The King’s Speech</em>. O. Russell’s <em>The Fighter</em> looks pretty good, but the fight sequences leave much to be desired, and even though it’s incredibly difficult for me to pass up the Coen brothers here I think the cinematography and performances are the real standouts for <em>True Grit</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Social Network" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.latinoreview.com/images/stories/blu-ray_dvd-screencaps-3/soc-net-end.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="182" />In the end I have to go with what seems to be the popular opinion and give this to Fincher. Keeping such a fast paced, intelligent film under such tight control is impressive and Fincher’s a master.</p>
<p><strong>Best Picture:</strong> <em>Black Swan</em>, <em>The Fighter</em>, <em>Inception</em>, <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, <em>The King’s Speech</em>, <em>127 Hours</em>, <em>The Social Network</em>, <em>Toy Story 3</em>, <em>True Grit</em>, <em>Winter’s Bone</em></p>
<p><strong>My pick: <img class="aligncenter" title="The Social Network" src="https://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2010/10/01/technology/Harvard_Social_Network.fortune/social_network_harvard.top.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="324" /></strong></p>
<p>There’s no need to go into great detail as my previous posts in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/category/the-cinephiles/the-great-oscar-race-the-cinephiles/">The Great Oscar Race</a> already do so. Critics have called this a down year. I suppose they’re somewhat correct. Most of the films in this category are very good, but few are great. Perhaps someone should recommend going from ten to five films? There I go again.</p>
<p>Narrowing this oversized (sorry) category down to a top three was easy for me. <em>True Grit</em>, <em>Winter’s Bone</em> and <em>The Social Network</em> were my clear standouts. But if I had to pick a film that really represents a total package, a perfect storm of cinematic brilliance, if you will, I’d have to take <em>The Social Network</em>. It’s just too well made, too well acted and too damned smart to ignore. It’s also better than a film about Facebook has any right to be.</p>
<p>That being said, <em>The King’s Speech</em> has gained so much momentum at this point that anything else winning (except maybe <em>The Social Network</em>) would be considered a fair sized upset.  We shall see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Probable winner: <img class="aligncenter" title="The King's Speech" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Kings-Speech-Geoffrey-Rush.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="284" /></strong></p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have failed. I have fallen one movie short in the Best Picture category and four short of my overall goal. Thirteen films in three weeks can be tricky business for a married fellow with obligations. Damn you <em>127 Hours</em> for not being as easily accessible as your fellow nominees! Damn you weather for thwarting my attempts to see Michelle Williams’ performance in <em>Blue Valentine</em>! Damn you <em>Rabbit Hole</em> for slipping so far under the radar that even I, a die-hard cinephile, completely forgot that you exist! And lastly, damn me for not making time to see <em>The Illusionist</em>. As a huge Jacques Tati fan I have no excuse. Perhaps I can make up for it?</p>
<p>Until then, I soldier on with my picks, spending more time in categories I feel the most versed in and deferring to rumor and pure vibe in the others.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actor in a Leading Role:</strong> Javier Bardem in <em>Biutiful</em>, Jeff Bridges in <em>True Grit</em>, Jesse Eisenberg in <em>The Social Network</em>, Colin Firth in <em>The King’s Speech</em>, James Franco in <em>127 Hours</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Jeff Bridges" src="https://i1.wp.com/manolomen.com/images/jeff-bridges.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="252" /><img class="alignright" title="Colin Firth" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/files/2011/01/Colin_Firth_and_Barbara_Stockings_cropped.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="249" />My pick:</strong> Jeff Bridges</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner:</strong> Colin Firth</p>
<p>This one’s a no-brainer. Firth has so much buzz at this point that you can’t even hear the other actors’ names. It is deserved, of course. His performance in <em>The King’s Speech</em> is subtle and endearing. Eisenberg is good, but David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin are really the guys carrying <em>The Social Network</em>. Javier Bardem’s role is a little overly sentimental and James Franco is the bleeding host of the show! His odds plummeted the minute they made the announcement.</p>
<p>So why Jeff Bridges? I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that some of it is because I’m a huge Jeff Bridges fan, but I’m always impressed when an actor manages to vanish into a role and I feel like he accomplishes that in his performance as Rooster Cogburn. Sure, he’s a funny, drunken, dirty cowboy. But the real elegance in his performance comes from the more subtle moments, like the slight shift in his demeanor when he watches young Mattie Ross basically will her horse across a river in order to exchange words with him. Unfortunately, Bridges won last year for his equally phenomenal performance in a less phenomenal movie (<em>Crazy Heart</em>) and the Academy isn’t terribly fond of repeats.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actor in a Supporting Role: </strong>Christian Bale in <em>The Fighter</em>, John Hawkes in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, Jeremy Renner in <em>The Town</em>, Mark Ruffalo in <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, Geoffrey Rush in <em>The King’s Speech</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="John Hawkes" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.wikia.com/lostpedia/images/4/42/John_Hawkes.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="320" /><img class="alignright" title="Christian Bale" src="https://i2.wp.com/images.askmen.com/specials/2007_top_49/men/christian_bale.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="290" />My pick: </strong>John Hawkes</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner: </strong>Christian Bale</p>
<p>Mark Ruffalo is charming as the über-cool Paul and Geoffrey Rush is as reliable as ever as the future King’s speech therapist. I haven’t seen <em>The Town</em>, but based on his performance in <em>The Hurt Locker</em> last year I have to imagine that Jeremy Renner is solid. But again I find myself leaning towards the more subtle performance, the one that doesn’t feel like a performance at all, and that’s John Hawkes in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>. This is not as to say that I don’t think Christian Bale deserves recognition for his work in <em>The Fighter</em> as it really is his movie, as far as I’m concerned, and his physical transformations are always impressive. It’s just that I liked <em>Winter’s Bone</em> so much more and John Hawkes is just so damned good as the hard edged, distrustful drug addict, Uncle Teardrop. The main character’s journey may lead her to some sort of catharsis but Teardrop’s is one of near-Shakespearian tragedy, and his final line is a heavy one.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actress in a Leading Role: </strong>Annette Bening in <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, Nicole Kidman in <em>Rabbit Hole</em>, Jennifer Lawrence in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, Natalie Portman in <em>Black Swan</em>, Michelle Williams in <em>Blue Valentine</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Jennifer Lawrence" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.comicbookmovie.com/images/uploads/Lawrence_sd420080713.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="297" /><img class="alignright" title="Natalie Portman" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/natalie-portman-teeth.jpg?w=231&#038;h=308" alt="" width="231" height="308" />My pick: </strong>Jennifer Lawrence</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner: </strong>Natalie Portman</p>
<p>This was a tough one for me. Having not seen both <em>Rabbit Hole</em> and <em>Blue Valentine</em> I can only guess as to whether or not they deserve to win it. Meanwhile, I loved <em>Black Swan</em> which contained a daring all-in performance from Natalie Portman, and Jennifer Lawrence’s more subtle portrayal of determined young woman in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, as well. My heart tells me that I got more satisfaction from the later, but my head tells me that the former is nearly unbeatable.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actress in a Supporting Role: </strong>Amy Adams in <em>The Fighter</em>, Helena Bonham Carter in <em>The King’s Speech</em>, Melissa Leo in <em>The Fighter</em>, Hailee Steinfeld in <em>True Grit</em>, Jacki Weaver in <em>Animal Kingdom</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Hailee Steinfeld" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.enthunder.com/photo/Hailee%20Steinfeld/Hailee-Steinfeld.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="284" /><img class="alignright" title="Hailee Steinfeld" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.enthunder.com/photo/Hailee%20Steinfeld/Hailee-Steinfeld.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="285" />My pick:</strong> Hailee Steinfeld</p>
<p><strong>Probable winner: </strong>Hailee Steinfeld</p>
<p>Amy Adams is solid as the outspoken girlfriend of “Irish” Mickey Ward in The Fighter, but she’s done even better work in far better films. Melissa Leo is excellent, but her character isn’t strong enough to leap out and Leo may have shot herself in the foot with her odd decision to <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/oscar-melissa-leo-goes-rogue-with-her-own-personal-campaign-ads/">fund her own “For your consideration” ads</a>. Helena Bonham Carter’s part isn’t showy enough no matter how well she played it and I’m not certain that Animal Kingdom got enough attention for Jacki Weaver to snag it.</p>
<p>This is another no brainer for me: Hailee Steinfeld. It’s a shame she was nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar when <em>True Grit</em> was clearly her film, but I’d imagine that injustice will not weigh on her much as she’s giving her acceptance speech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Toy Story 3 poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.pixartoystory.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/poster-toy-story-3.jpg" alt="" width="253" height="349" />Pixar is money, pure and simple. They have raised the bar on the animated film, having mastered the ability to engage a child while still holding the interest of an adult. The <em>Toy Story</em> series has always been pretty kid-centric but not without its mature themes. <em>Toy Story 3</em> heads into infinity and almost beyond adult territory (No, not THAT adult territory), with emphasis on themes like growing up, life changes and even dictatorship. Don’t worry; the cute toys are still there. I did say almost.</p>
<p>Those familiar with the series will remember Andy, owner of Woody the cowboy (Tom Hanks) and Buzz Lightyear the action figure (Tim Allen) amongst a great many other toys. In the original <em>Toy Story</em>, Woody and Buzz battled each other for the honor of being the most favored among all of Andy’s toys. In <em>Toy Story 2</em>, Buzz and Woody started to face the idea that the day will come when Andy will no longer needs them. In <em>Toy Story 3</em>, that day has come. Andy’s off to college.</p>
<p>I was struck by how much of this film was actually kind of a downer. This isn’t a criticism necessarily; it’s just that this may leave some kids wanting. Things go from being sad to downright bleak as the toys vacillate between the idea of either being in toy limbo (the attic) or toy hell (the dump). They think they’ve gotten lucky when they end up donated to a daycare facility. Instead, they discover that they’re in toy Uganda. The Pixar crew does eventually bring things back around to provide a sweet, tear-jerking ending and a fitting finale for the series as a whole, but still.</p>
<p>I am a sucker for Pixar’s films. If their name is on it, odds are it&#8217;s worth seeing. <em>Toy Story 3</em> is no exception, but I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that this wasn’t one of my favorites. It’s very, very good, but I think I’d still take either of the first two over this one. A strong argument could be made that this film was nominated for Best Picture simply because <em>Wall-E</em> and <em>Up</em> probably should have been in the years prior. Odds are it won’t win both Best Picture and Best Animated Feature, so if I had to guess I’d say it’s more likely to take the later. That being said, <em>The Illusionist</em> might sneak away with that one. Could this be the first year in a good long while that we can no longer refer to the Best Animated Feature award as the Best Pixar Award?</p>
<p><strong>Toy Story 3 <em>is nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature Film, Best Music (Original Song), Best Sound Editing &amp; Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)</em></strong></p>
