										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent video game film, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> (2012), has been called by some &#8220;the best video game movie ever made.&#8221; On the surface, that sounds like quite the endorsement, but if you dig deeper, such a title doesn&#8217;t carry much weight when you look at the rest of the sample in question.</p>
<p>In short, it is almost like calling <em>Rambo III</em> (1988) &#8220;the best Rambo-goes-to-Afghanistan movie ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s an exaggeration, but not far from the mark.</p>
<p>The original <em>Tron</em> (1982) is perhaps the only other video game film worthy of battling <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> for the title of &#8220;best video game ever,&#8221; because let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; most video game movies ain&#8217;t that good.</p>
<p>One would think, with plenty of captivating stories played out on home consoles every day, making a great video game movie would be easy. For some reason it is not.</p>
<p>Why? I don&#8217;t know, maybe, unlike <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, most video game films don&#8217;t embrace their video-gameness. <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not, which is the Achilles&#8217; heel of most video game films. <em>Resident Evil</em> (2002)? How do you screw up a special forces team fighting zombies in a spooky mansion?</p>
<p><em>Street Fighter</em> (1994)? That is worthy of its own article. Man, I waited <em>in line</em> on opening night to see that turkey.</p>
<p>And then there is the gold standard of failed video game films: <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (1993).</p>
<p>I confess to <strong>a)</strong> seeing <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in the theater on opening weekend and <strong>b)</strong> owning the DVD.</p>
<p>Yes, years later, as an adult, I made the conscious decision to own the film.</p>
<p>Is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8220;good&#8221;? That depends on what one considers good. Story-wise, no, not really. It&#8217;s just strange. Entertainment-wise, yes, because it is so ridiculous. Get some beers, call over your friends, and put on <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8212; there is no way you don&#8217;t enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Plus, Mojo Nixon <a title="video on youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4_nFgY7PZA">has a cameo</a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4_nFgY7PZA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Why is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <b>so</b> strange? Because it didn&#8217;t embrace its video-gameness. The film tries to explain the <em>hows</em> and <em>whys</em> of the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> universe, which is its biggest mistake &#8212; but it is also the reason why it is so hilarious.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the film in a vacuum. If the screenwriters were told &#8220;try to explain how this universe with King Koopa and mushroom people could really happen,&#8221; they made quite the effort. An asteroid knocking dinosaurs into a parallel dimension, where they evolved into humanoids? OK.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great for an episode of <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Sliders</em>, but it doesn&#8217;t really belong in a movie about <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need realistic explanations for plumbers growing into giants or shooting fireballs at angry turtles as they try to save a princess. People accept <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> for what it is: <b>fantasy</b>.</p>
<p>And this is how <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> earned its many praises: it ups the fantasy and doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not. There isn&#8217;t any screen time devoted to <i>why</i> the video game characters are &#8220;alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>They just <i>are</i>, and that is good enough for me.</p>
<p>But, on some level, I am glad <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> tried to be as serious as it is &#8212; otherwise, I may not have one of my favorite bad movies to watch with friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me, platformers have always been nostalgic. Sure, my first videogame console was an NES with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, but I was too young in those days to have a valuable opinion about it (I know this because my favorite NES game, at the time, was <em>Batman Returns</em>). The first game that made a true impression on me was <em>Super Mario 64</em>. It was also the first game I really immersed myself in and played thoughtfully. All that to say, I belong more closely to the first generation of 3D games than I do the Golden Age of 2D cartridges.</p>
<p>In contrast to Dan (who I believe is about 100 years old), by the time I was in high school and college, platformers were already nostalgic. Now that I think about it, I&#8217;ve played through more side-scrollers using an emulator than on an actual console.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s <em>Cave Story</em>, which I am playing on my Mac (it&#8217;s only $9.99 on Steam), a platformer designed deliberately to evoke nostalgia. The Kool-Aid Man reference, as Dan pointed out, is a great example of <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s bizarre sense of humor and its playful self-winking. I&#8217;m not much further than the Balrog &#8212; ostensibly the first boss &#8212; but I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s just the first of many nerdy inside jokes. And I&#8217;m looking forward to them all!</p>
<p>One thing that bugs me is that the physics of <em>Cave Story</em> seem a little off. The jumps feel sort of loose, almost floaty. Of course, platformers don&#8217;t have to adhere to Earth&#8217;s physics, but it has to feel like there&#8217;s sort of predictable gravity. When I jump I want to know where I&#8217;ll land.</p>
<p>I have a friend who has this theory that the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> has the perfect platformer physics. I believe that. There&#8217;s something natural and predictable about the way Mario jumps. Is it because Miyamoto engineered the jump perfectly, or because <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> defined what that perfect jump is supposed to feel like? I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;ve seen people who don&#8217;t play video games give a spectacular run through <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> for that reason.</p>
<p>Outside of pure nostalgia, I think that&#8217;s the ultimate appeal of platformers today. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to teach someone all the buttons to play <em>Halo</em>, you realize just how complicated games have become. Platformers have a familiar linearity to them. <em>Cave Story</em> is a largely two-button game, and I find its simplicity comforting and endearing. So while I&#8217;m charmed by <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s idiosyncracies, I&#8217;m waiting to fall in love with its mechanics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a moment towards the tail end of Rockstar Games&#8217; epic western <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> when, after a long campaign filled with violence, you are finally allowed to return home to your wife and child.  As you ride across the plains the soundtrack swells.  It feels triumphant, sentimental and incredibly cinematic.</p>
<p><div style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption alignright"><em><img class="  " title="Red Dead Sunset" src="https://i2.wp.com/cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2010/10/sunset.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="227" /></em><p class="wp-caption-text">Yeah, she&#039;s a beaut.</p></div> <em>Red Dead</em> is not alone.  Video games in general  have become increasingly cinematic.  They are essentially fulfilling a niche  market the film industry has only toyed with (rather unsuccessfully):  The interactive movie.  But where the film industry failed&mdash;film viewing is  still inherently passive, regardless of the viewer&#8217;s ability choose which scene to view&mdash;the video game industry flourished by actually allowing you to play the &#8220;film&#8221; out.  You become attached to characters like John Marston because you are John Marston.  You control his every move.  If you want to stroll along the  banks of a great lake at sunrise, you can do so. (Yes, I have done this. The  game&#8217;s environment is as beautiful as it is expansive.  Also, I&#8217;m a sensitive  guy.) The story progresses at your whim.</p>
<p>An even more literal example of video game as interactive  movie comes in the form of Quantic Dreams&#8217; <em>Heavy Rain</em>, in which every  decision, from action to dialog choice, affects the games outcome.  <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s story  involves a serial killer and the four player-controlled characters investigating  the case.   Its emphasis is not on action, but plot progression and character  development. And there is <em>Uncharted 2</em>, which features some of the best video game writing and voice acting I&#8217;ve ever heard, and plays out like an old school action serial in the vein of <em>Indiana Jones</em>.  Films disguised as video games.</p>
<p>This merger of film sensibility and video game interactivity makes for an exciting future in the gaming world.  In the film world, however, it hasn&#8217;t fared quite so well.</p>
<p><div style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="Super Mario Bros." src="https://i2.wp.com/analogmedium.com/blog/2008/04/supermariobros2.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">At least somebody&#039;s having fun. </p></div> In 1993 somebody thought it was a good idea to adapt <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>for the screen.  It&#8217;s a video game about a plumber and his brother battling a giant turtle-dragon thing in order to rescue a princess.  It doesn&#8217;t take a genius to know that that probably wont translate well.  Or how about the dreadful <em>Street Fighter (1994)</em> film, which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme opposite Raul Julia.  Raul Julia?!  Yes,  Raul Julia (RIP).  Ever resilient, Hollywood gave it a second go in 2009 with <em>Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li</em>. It starred Kristen Kreuk, Chris Klein, and Moon Bloodgood.  With an all-star cast like that, how could they have gone wrong?!</p>
<p><em>Mortal Kombat&#8217;s (1995)</em> &#8220;plot&#8221; had several human fighters being transported to an alternate dimension so that they could compete in a mixed martial arts tournament against monsters and evil wizards.  You know, when you say it out loud (or type it) it sounds a little ridiculous, doesn&#8217;t it?  You know what sounds even more <a title="Mortal Kombat Ending" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrvDenYGICM">ridiculous</a>?  Christopher Lambert playing an Asian lightning god, that&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>Speaking of ridiculous, there is 2005&#8217;s<em> Doom</em>, which starred Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson and featured a <a title="DOOM POV" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpb13mDBP1I">sequence shot entirely in the game&#8217;s first-person shooter</a> perspective, and <em>House of the Dead (2003)</em>, which features actual video game footage inserted into the film!  2006&#8217;s <em>Silent Hill</em> was arguably one of the better video game to film adaptations, if only for maintaining the game&#8217;s unique style and look, but its nearly incomprehensible story makes for a confusing and ultimately anti-climactic film.</p>
<p>I believe the inherent problem here is video game fans or, more to the point, the film industry&#8217;s perception of video game fans.  They believe that fans simply will not be satisfied with a high quality film that may forsake a few of the games&#8217; details in favor of a better story.  Please, stop making films based on games that won&#8217;t let us forget they are based on games!  Do not try to &#8220;organically&#8221; insert game elements into the film!  It is not clever.</p>
<p>And lastly (I am running into rant territory, after all), please spare us the games based on films as well.  Aside from the LEGO series (<em>LEGO Batman, LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Indiana Jones. </em> Hell, I&#8217;d play<em> LEGO Fargo!</em>), they are lazy, clunky and wholly unnecessary.  Rebuttal?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I had any illusions about holding on to my youth, they were dispelled by Nintendo’s hoopla surrounding the 25th anniversary of the release of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></p>
<p>(And may I step to the side for a moment and comment on how much I adore the fact that the name of the game is “<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>” and not “<em>Super Mario Brothers</em>”? Mario and Luigi are the original bros, and for an entire generation they were a first bromance. God bless you 8-bit space limitations!)</p>

Pretty, no?</p></div> Sure, a red Wii looks cool, and it’s fab that they’re packaging the console with <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> (although red console buyers will be missing out on <em>Wii Sports Resort</em>, which is pretty fab too), but if you’re old enough to remember playing the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on an 8-bit NES (which I did), you’re just old. Deal with it.</p>
<p>But because nostalgia isn’t the sole province of baby boomers, and because I’ve been working on ways to (slowly) break my children into the vast wonderful world of video games, I downloaded the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> game on the Wii’s Virtual Console several weeks ago. It has been an interesting experiment. A year ago, when the Wii came into the house, the motion-control <em>Wii Sports</em> game had been the girls’ only first-hand exposure to video games, and I remember my amusement when Rabbit (not her real name) tried a demo of the <em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</em> set up on a big-screen TV at Best Buy. It was a revelation to me that she couldn’t quite fathom pushing a button in order to make Mario jump, but insisted on jerking the controller into the air.</p>
<p>I thought for a while that I was going to have a great column about the new generation of motion-control natives, but when I loaded up the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and gave the controller to Rabbit for the first time, the problem didn’t persist. Neither Rabbit nor Bootsy (also not her real name) is very good at <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, but Rabbit is perfectly comfortable pushing buttons to control the game.</p>
<p>In fact, I shouldn’t make too much of the fact that Rabbit isn’t very good at the game, because, in all honesty, I’m not either, and I never was.</p>

The opportunity was too good to pass up. With one fell swoop I turned on my Wii and showed her that what was old was new again. In minutes we were laughing as mushrooms bounced off of boxes and pipes unexpectedly and escaped, and as my mother adjusted to the fact that collecting every coin isn’t quite as important as getting to the end of the level before the timer runs out. For a moment, I got to be a Super Mario expert, finding hidden 1-Ups and secret pipes. Happily, no one seemed to notice or care that I never even made it through Bowser’s first castle.</p>
<p>Because the big secret of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is that it’s hard&mdash;harder than you remember, especially if you haven’t played it in a while. I certainly seemed to have been the odd man out as a child in that I never beat the game, but like most 8-bit side-scrolling platformers, the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> is really a game of reflexes and memorization. And there are no save points. If you make a mistake, you generally have to start all over.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that while Mario is an icon for me, and in a lot of ways the game experience I measure other games against, I’ve never really loved the game. I get bored with platformers pretty quickly, and I’ve found that to be true through the years. I’ve been impressed by turns with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, and <em>Little Big Planet</em>, but I’ve given up on all of them sooner or later. They’re each, unique, inventive, and gorgeous to look at, but at some point, I need a game to revolve around more than jumping. I’m getting too old for that shit.</p>
