<p>It was a piece of notebook paper. It was a little damp &#8212; Ronnie had ferreted it away in his palm after dinner; his mother would not allow it out of the house.</p>
<p>It was a piece of paper signed by Sparky Anderson. The lines of the paper, the scratchy black of what had to have been a Bic medium point ballpoint pen cresting and peaking over the hills and valleys formed when he signed the paper against Ronnie&#8217;s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t kiss Ronnie then &#8212; there was a crucifix on the wall behind us, and Father Erpelding was walking the halls, smoking his pipe. But I knew, in that moment, I&#8217;d been right to let him put his lips on mine in first grade, even if my mother did find out and chastise me, even if my mother didn&#8217;t think it was funny when Ronnie and I glued our hands together with Elmer&#8217;s (we removed the orange cap) in protest.</p>
<p>How precious was that paper! We insisted the church secretary, Mrs. Cassar, make a Xerox copy for us; I kept that faux-Sparky autograph for years. It stayed on the dresser next to my bed even after Ronnie moved away (I remember he told me he was switching schools while we shared the strawberries his mother packed in his metal lunchbox), even after the baseball strike, after all my dogs died and I grew my hair long and then cut it short and then left for college.</p>
<p>Sparky, we know, is dying &#8212; not in that existential, postmodern sense. He is really dying.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember when I realized I&#8217;d lost the autograph. But I&#8217;m certain I wasn&#8217;t sad.</p>
<p>The scrap of paper was a talisman. Once, I hit two triples in a game and saw my name in the local paper the next. I touched the paper again before the next game, and stuck out looking twice.</p>
<p>The scrap of paper was not magic. The name on it was.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because of Sparky Anderson that Jim Leyland wears cleats in the dugout. It&#8217;s because of Sparky Anderson that we now have a battery of bullpen pitchers, from Brian Wilson to Joel Zumaya to the nameless workhorses taking the ball in the third inning. It&#8217;s because Kirk Gibson sulked into Sparky&#8217;s office, intent on kicking his ass after being benched, and got his ass kicked instead, that the Tigers became a team of winners (before becoming a team of losers). It&#8217;s because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Gibson" target="_blank">Sparky did this in Game 5 of the 1984 series </a>that I knew, even as an elementary schooler, that his name on paper was precious:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the <em><a title="Sounds of the Game (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sounds_of_the_Game&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Sounds of the Game</a></em> video, Detroit manager <a title="Sparky Anderson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparky_Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a> was seen in the dugout, yelling at Gibson, <em>&#8220;He don&#8217;t want to walk you!&#8221;</em> and making a bat-swinging motion with his hands, the universal baseball gesture for &#8220;swing away.&#8221; Gibson got the message, and launched Gossage&#8217;s 1-0 fastball deep into <a title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Stadium_(Detroit)">Tiger Stadium</a>&#8216;s right field upper deck for a three-run homer, icing the game and the Series for the Tigers.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://multimedia.detnews.com/pix/photogalleries/sportsgallery/sparkyanderson/index21.html" target="_blank">because Sparky wore batting gloves</a> on his hands when he argued with umpires.</p>
<p>﻿It&#8217;s because he insisted that every one of his players was better than Mickey Mantle, or Johnny Bench &#8212; it&#8217;s because, growing up in the shadow of Sparky&#8217;s foot hitched up on the dugout steps, we all thought we could be legends, too.</p>
<p>None of that was on the bit of paper. And none of it, really, can be lost.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now think again of the legends. Think of their names – their nicknames, infinitely more powerful and weighted with meaning than their given names.

The Great One. The Intimidator. The Great Bambino.

Now think of the names of the men who hope to be legends, or who played hard enough to perhaps, one day, be a footnote to legendary days:

The Perfect Storm. The Answer. Little Ball of Hate. King James. Prince Albert.

Now think of the great athletes of our time, and how devoid they are of excellent, aspirational names: Miggy. Manny. A-Rod. K-Rod. And so on and so forth.

None of these men will ever be great men (here I am reminded of the absurd song from Gang of Four) so long as their names offer no direction, nothing to become (an intimidator, a bearer of greatness) and begin no prophetic cycle of legend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone needs a good nickname – at least, any athlete who aspires to greatness. </p>
<p>Think back to that great baseball movie of my childhood (you, gentle reader, may not be the same age as I), <em>The Sandlot</em>. Hamilton Porter is doing his best impression of The Great Bambino, when the loveable Smalls intimates that he didn’t know who said Bambino was.</p>
<blockquote><p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyFaLT-L2uk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe><br />
Squints: You&#8217;ve never heard of the sultan of swat?<br />
Kenny: The titan of terror.<br />
Timmy: The colossus of clout!<br />
Tommy: The colossus of clout!<br />
Benny Rodriguez: The king of crash, man. </p></blockquote>
<p>What’s key to this whole scene is that the boys never once refer to the player by his “real” name, Babe Ruth. Which, of course, is in itself simply a lesser nickname. And of course the whole refusal to call the Babe by his name sets up a fabulous turn of events at the end of the movie </p>
<blockquote><p>Squints: Where did your old man get that ball?<br />
Smalls: I don&#8217;t know. Some lady gave it to him. She even signed her name on it&#8230; Ruth. Baby Ruth.</p></blockquote>
<p>wherein the mysterious owner of the dog, The Beast, that has terrorized the boys, reveals himself to have been a friend of the legend, whom he calls….GEORGE!</p>
<p>Deep breath.</p>
<p>The whole issue of names as signifiers, and perhaps even as predictors of personhood is perhaps more academic territory than I am qualified or willing to cover. But let’s delve in anyway. </p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_307" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-307" data-attachment-id="307" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/07/the-importance-of-being-ernie-not-ernest-or-how-nicknames-make-legends/plato1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg" data-orig-size="203,248" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="plato1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=203" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=203" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=640" alt="Plato" title="plato1"   class="size-full wp-image-307" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg 203w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=123 123w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /><p id="caption-attachment-307" class="wp-caption-text">I like the way she thinks. Also Ty Cobb. I love Ty Cobb. The Georgia Peach, they called him.</p></div>What if names, nicknames, signifiers (chair, table, couch) don’t simply attach a series of sounds to make it easier to communicate, but actually somehow denote and in turn FORM the essence of the thing they’re pointing to? </p>
<p>Not so radical, right? The word “couch” would always signify that lovely leather number parked alongside the fireplace, and would also somehow inherently refer to the object’s intrinsic “couch-ness.” </p>
<p>Now, what if nicknames worked the same way? What if, the day Dale Earnhardt became “The Intimidator,” he was both assigned a mission – named what he should become – and was somehow changed by that naming? </p>
<p>It’s cyclical. It’s the very cliché of the self-fulfilling prophesy. </p>
<p>Now think again of the legends (another wonderful trope of <em>The Sandlot</em>, by the way – when the Babe emerges from a closet to christen Benny a legend and tells him that heroes get remembered but legends never die.)</p>
<p>Now think of their names – their nicknames, infinitely more powerful and weighted with meaning than their given names.</p>
<p>The Great One. The Intimidator. The Great Bambino.</p>
<p>Now think of the names of the men who hope to be legends, or who played hard enough to perhaps, one day, be a footnote to legendary days:</p>
<p>The Perfect Storm. The Answer. Little Ball of Hate. King James. Prince Albert.</p>
<p>Now think of the great athletes of our time, and how devoid they are of excellent, aspirational names: Miggy. Manny. A-Rod. K-Rod. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>None of these men will ever be great men (here I am reminded of the absurd song from Gang of Four) so long as their names offer no direction, nothing to become (an intimidator, a bearer of greatness) and begin no prophetic cycle of legend. </p>
<p>Their nicknames, even, lack the sound and the fury – and still signify nothing.</p>
<p>What, then, should we be calling these men? </p>
