										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leviathan</em> (2012) straddles the line between documentary and avant-garde; composed entirely from footage shot on a large fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean, it hints at how life is lived on the boat, but exists primarily as a visual and auditory experience. Things happen, but there is no plot; our understanding is entirely derived from the images, sound, and what understanding (little, in my case) we might have of industrial fishing.</p>

<p>The film begins, incongruously, with a Bible verse, written in a Gothic-tribal font, then cuts to a black screen with the sound of the ocean churning. A light flickers in the bottom corner of the image, and eventually, we find ourselves on board a massive fishing boat, all clinking chains, painted metal, and winches. During the first ten minutes, we witness, through a camera strapped to one of the workers, the process of bringing up a net that’s been trawling the ocean, and then releasing the mass of slippery silver and pink fish caught in the trap. This labor feels, well, laborious, and has only just begun &#8212; when the sequence ends, we notice that light just barely turned the sky from black to navy blue.</p>
<p>The excitement and movement of the opening sequence belies the repetition and drudgery of the work to come. In two later sequences, the camera lingers on the men cleaning the fish, gutting and beheading them with an efficiency that comes from experience. To those unaccustomed to slaughter, the scene is almost enough to turn one to vegetarianism. As the men work, the camera pans down the side of the wooden bin where the newly caught fish are kept, awaiting their fate, to find it caked and dripping with gore. A group of skates are equally doomed; as a fisherman unceremoniously lifts one with meat hooks, another hacks off its wing-like fins and tosses them into a bin. The waste of the fish – heads, guts, and fins – is dumped back into the sea. With the camera sitting on the ship’s steel floor, a fish’s head sits upside down; its bulbous eye stares back at us, as if prompting a response. Then, we cut to another camera half-submerged in the sea, sometimes underwater, other times emerging into the air, as fish viscera slides out the side of the ship in a red sludge. If ever one needed a visual illustration of the term “biomass,” <em>Leviathan</em> offers it.</p>

<p>Matching the unsentimental vision of the labor needed to help feed a population eager for seafood, who in turn are shielded from the violence involved in securing those meals, is a vision of the sea as vast and all-encompassing. Shots where the camera is plunged into the water offer little but darkness and the muffled reverberations of the ship, interrupted only by the white streaks of the wake and the occasional offal. The film’s soundtrack of crashing waves, winches and chains, and the deep rumble of the engines takes on an ominous musical quality in these scenes; so much so that I imagined incidental music emerging just under hearing.</p>
<p>Whereas the scenes of labor lull you with a sense of repetition, the “underwater” sequences transform the sea into an aesthetic, where you glimpse only the occasional recognizable object &#8212; a chain, a fish, seagulls when the lens breaks the surface. <em>Leviathan</em> is one part <em>Jeanne Dielman</em> (1975), and one part <em>Dog Star Man</em> (1961-1964), though even together those films are not quite the right comparison. There is something more real, and more accidental, about <em>Leviathan</em>, something to do with the primal in the midst of the industrial. One of the last shots of the film shows one of the fisherman seated in the ship’s kitchen; the garbage from his finished meal litters the table and he looks towards us but slightly off-screen. It sounds like he’s watching <em>Deadliest Catch</em>, and what we can hear &#8212; dramatic music, narration, editing &#8212; differs so greatly from the experience we’ve just had. As the show continues, the fisherman slowly closes his eyes, obviously exhausted from his work, and the television cuts to a commercial for a colon cleanser &#8212; two final reminders of biological reality in this strange approximation of home, deep in the bowels of the floating factory. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Roger Ebert was the first film critic I read seriously. For years as a teenager I awaited his reviews every Friday, and his was the first collection of film criticism I ever bought. He taught me that one could disagree with accepted wisdom about a film, and reach one’s own conclusion about it; moreover, he taught me how to defend that opinion. I remember disliking David Lynch’s <em>Blue Velvet</em> (1986) because of Ebert’s review, and after seeing it years later and revising my opinion, his influence remained, because now the lesson had stuck &#8212; my conclusion was my own. Although I read him less in recent years, he appeared still as a model of someone who believed in both cinema and humanity. Although it is sometimes difficult to retain a trust in either, this is another of Ebert’s lessons worth remembering.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strangely enough, the genre description “deliberately artificial romantic melodrama slash Thai western” don’t do justice to Wisit Sasanatieng’s 2000 film <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em>. The film is a postmodern pastiche of the most shallow and wonderful kind: ambitious, energetic, and entertaining, combining disparate clichés, both narrative and visual, to form something new and unique. </p>
<p>When the film opens, Dum (pronounced like Dahm, so it’s not really that funny) and Mahesuan, two gunmen dressed like parodies of cowboy tourists, assault a country house, shooting and killing everyone inside.  We learn that Dum, the eponymous Black Tiger, and Mahesuan are the right hand men of Fai, an outlaw whose band terrorizes the Thai countryside.  Meanwhile, a young woman, Rumpoey, waits in a lagoon gazebo for someone who never arrives; when she gazes at a photograph of the lover who has jilted her, we see it is Dum.  Dum arrives too late for their rendezvous, and Rumpoey returns home to be engaged to Kumjorn, a respectable and ambitious police captain. </p>

<p>Kumjorn, eager to prove himself, suggests to Rumpoey’s father, the governor, an attack on Fai and his men. The attack goes well for the police &#8212; that is, until Dum and Mahesuan return from a night of drunken revelry, in which they pledged blood brotherhood to each other. Kumjorn is captured, but Dum takes pity on him and lets him escape when he learns Kumjorn is betrothed to Rumpoey. Obviously, this sets in motion a love triangle between Dum, Kumjorn, and Rampoey, and sets Dum and Mahesuan against each other when Fai becomes suspicious of the infamous Black Tiger’s motives. </p>
<p>In classic melodramatic tradition, the plot is both deceptively simple and convoluted, as my description might suggest &#8212; and it leaves out the last third of the movie, as well as the flashback sequences where we learn how Dum and Rumpoey first met and fell in love. It trades in familiar narrative tropes and character types: the love triangle, romance between different social classes, the honorable outlaw, brothers (actual or figurative) set against one another by fate.  Complementing those well-tread narrative pathways, <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em> utilizes an expressive and inventive aesthetic cobbled together from past visual styles. The bright, saturated color schema and slight haze recalls the cheap color systems used in imitation of Technicolor by Indian and other Asian cinemas of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. The garish red of the blood reminds one of the thick splashes of Hammer horror films.  The musical leitmotif that follows the outlaw cowboys imitates Ennio Morricone’s Western themes, while the scenes between Dum and Rumpoey feature Max Steiner-like romantic swells.  </p>

<p>The purpose of this pastiche seems to be the deliberate interrogation of older styles and forms of filmmaking.  The artifice commonplace to classical filmmaking, but passé now &#8212; sets used for outdoor locations, over-emotive performances, rear projection driving &#8212; are not only used in <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em>, but made blindingly obvious to the viewer. The flashback to Dum and Rumpoey’s childhood even begins with a sequence that parodies silent film parodies, complete with overcranked projector speed, missing frames, and artificially induced dust and scratches. </p>
<p>A scene between Dum and Rumpoey as children offers a possible answer to the questions raised. At the gazebo where Rumpoey will later wait for him, only to be disappointed, Dum tells her a folktale about the builder of the gazebo. He was a woodcutter who fell in love with a wealthy girl, and built the structure as a monument to her beauty. When the girl’s father learned of her plan to run away and marry the woodcutter, he locked her away in their house, where she hanged herself in despair. Obviously the folktale is meant to resonate with the film’s main storyline of a socially unacceptable pairing and its potential for a tragic conclusion. I would offer, however, that this scene is key to understanding the film as a broader piece of work.  Its relationship to older models of filmmaking casts them as a kind of folktale storytelling, not meant to be naturalistic, but rather to conjure up modes of feeling and aesthetic appreciation unrelated to the quotidian modern. Those moments of artifice and of cinematic excess are clues to the viewer, telling us this is just a story, and just as the film echoes Dum’s folktale, attesting to its lessons, <em>Tears of the Black Tiger</em> evokes the cinematic past to remind us of the truths embedded therein.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Shochiku studio released <em>The X From Outer Space</em> in 1967, they likely had high hopes for their own successful <em>kajiu eiga</em> (giant monster movie) series, much like Toho Studios’ famed <em>Godzilla</em> (1954), which by then already had seven profitable features.  Unfortunately for Shochiku, their monster Guilala failed to have the even modest success of Gamera, another of the giant monsters riding Godzilla’s spiky coattails.  For one thing, the tongue twister “Guilala” probably didn’t help.</p>
<p>Despite poor Guilala’s lack of popular appeal, the film that introduced him fascinates in its own right as an example of the craftsmanship of mid-century Japanese genre film.  An unscientific survey of comments on YouTube suggests that <em>The X From Outer Space</em> is considered a “so bad it’s good” style cult film, but I find it a good deal more interesting and well-made than many of the later Godzilla films, which are mostly repetitive, “monster of the year” wrestling matches between two men in rubber suits. To be fair, perhaps Guilala would have suffered the same fate as his compatriots Godzilla and Gamera, had <em>The X From Outer Space</em> succeeded.  After all, the first Godzilla film is probably the only masterpiece the <em>kajiu eiga</em> genre produced.  </p>
<p><em>The X From Outer Space</em> is only really a <em>kaiju eiga</em> in the second half of the film.  The first half of the film is a “voyage through space” narrative, similar to something like <em>Destination Moon</em> (1950) or <em>Rocketship X-M</em> (1950).  The crew of the AAB Gamma is dispatched to Mars to investigate the disappearance of previous expeditions, the cause of which, we are told “may be UFOs.”  The ship’s crew is diverse, made up of both Japanese and Americans, and they are directed from Earth by Dr. Berman and Dr. Kato.  In this respect, <em>The X From Outer Space</em> seems to emerge from the same Cold War liberal consensus as <em>Star Trek</em>, imagining space travel as a global, international venture undertaken for the benefit of humanity &#8212; though perhaps to attribute such sentiment to <em>The X From Outer Space</em> gives it the benefit of too much doubt.  </p>

<p>AAB Gamma experiences a fairly standard set of space travel film complications &#8212; a threatening UFO which resembles a glowing pastry, an ill crewmember who endangers the others, and a brief pit stop at the international moon station, which sets in motion a lamely conceived love triangle between Capt. Sano, ship’s scientist Lisa, and Michiko, a staff member at the moon station who holds a torch for the good captain.  The moon stop does provide a distraction for a kitsch-minded audience, however, as we get a full dose of the film’s mid-60s space age production design. </p>

<p>After replacing the ill crew member, the AAB Gamma blasts back into space, and once again encounters the UFO, which this time deposits a sticky, weblike substance onto the ship, attaching a glowing orb which, we later learn, is an egg containing Guilala.  The UFO has apparently mistaken the AAB Gamma for a mate.  The crew of the ship removes the glowing orb, for science, and naturally return it to Earth for study.  Predictably, the orb opens and Guilala escapes, grows to monstrous size at tremendous speed, and proceeds to attack power stations across Japan, feeding on the energy.  </p>
<p>At this point, the film becomes less interesting than during the “voyage through space” first half.  This is largely because the plot then follows the general formula of the kaiju eiga: Guilala threatens destroy a major urban area (as usual, Tokyo), the standard efforts of the military fail to cease his rampage, and the main characters stand around discussing said rampage until they discover a scientific way of destroying the monster.  The mise-en-scene feels familiar as well:  Guilala is clearly a man in a suit, smashing small model buildings, and matte shots allow the rubber terror to menace fleeing Japanese civilians.  Still, the entire thing is charmingly lo-fi, and demonstrates a level of special effects craftsmanship entirely lost in the digital age.  Perhaps my greater interest in the first half is a result of its leisurely pace and lack of urgency or clear direction, which enables a contemporary audience to appreciate the production design and effects.   </p>

<p>My objection to calling <em>The X From Outer Space</em> merely a laughable B-movie is that clear care was put into making the film, even if it aspires to be no more than a standard genre offering.  Consider the film’s repeated use of graphic matches.  Although it’s not entirely clear whether the filmmakers intend for us to make a comparison in using the device, its repetition seems a clear indicator of an aesthetic sensibility at work.  Finally, the soundtrack to the film is absolutely tremendous, featuring laidback, lounge-pop 60s music mixed with science fiction effects (sadly, no theremin, which fell out of popular use by this time), matching the film’s space-age optimism, though it does undercut the threat Guilala is supposed to represent.  To be fair, he was never that threatening anyway.  </p>
<p><em>The X From Outer Space</em> is dated as hell, and never once reaches the poetry of the original Godzilla (though few films do).  But it has enough idiosyncrasy to recommend it. I’ve read that a sequel was produced in 2008, but given the state of contemporary Japanese pop culture, I think I’ll skip it.  I prefer the charm of the 60s incarnation.      </p>
