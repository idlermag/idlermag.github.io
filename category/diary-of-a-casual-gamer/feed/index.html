										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I visited the Smithsonian Museum of American Art&#8217;s &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221; exhibit for a second time, and I&#8217;ve read so much criticism of the exhibit that I&#8217;d like to start off with what it does right.</p>
<p>Having video games on featured display at a major U.S. art museum is undeniably cool, and a welcome rejoinder to Roger Ebert&#8217;s infamous assertion that <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html" target="_blank">&#8220;video games can never be art.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the single best part of &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221; is the room where visitors actually get to play. Five games &#8212; <em>Pac Man</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, <em>Myst</em>, and <em>Flower</em> &#8212; are set up on huge, wall-sized screens.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10152" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/29/a-room-of-its-own/flowerdynamic/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg" data-orig-size="2629,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M341 Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1340719843&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;160&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.076923076923077&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="FlowerDynamic" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=640&#038;h=525" alt="the play room" title="FlowerDynamic" width="640" height="525" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10152" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=640&amp;h=525 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=1278&amp;h=1050 1278w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=150&amp;h=123 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=300&amp;h=246 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=768&amp;h=631 768w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/flowerdynamic.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=841 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also, for lack of a better word, cool to see so many actual iconic consoles gathered into one place. Even when it&#8217;s not plugged in, the SNES, for one, is a beautiful example of industrial design.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10155" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/29/a-room-of-its-own/snes/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg" data-orig-size="3654,1945" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M341 Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1340720180&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;160&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033332999769841&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SNES" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=640&#038;h=340" alt="" title="SNES" width="640" height="340" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10155" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=640&amp;h=340 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=1277&amp;h=680 1277w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=150&amp;h=80 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=300&amp;h=160 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=768&amp;h=409 768w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/snes.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=545 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>But, unfortunately, that&#8217;s the best of what I have to say. To be fair, when an entire medium &#8212; dozens of consoles and systems, thousands of games, millions of players &#8212; is crammed into three medium-sized gallery rooms, it&#8217;s going to be almost impossible to avoid finding fault. Amazing games are going to be left out. History will be simplified, glossed over, or ignored. Even the gameplay has to be limited &#8212; each game resets after a few minutes in order to allow as many people as possible a chance to take a turn.</p>
<p>At IGN, <a href="http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1221949p1.html" target="_blank">Michael Thomsen criticizes &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221;</a> for focusing on games produced by corporate developers rather than more individual works from people like Mary Flanagan, Michael Mateas, and Andrew Stern, whose games might be harder to find, and which arguably focus more on the expression of an idea or a unique mechanic than finding a commercial audience. This focus, according to Thomsen, ends up working against the argument that video games belong in The Museum of American Art. &#8220;The Art of Video Games has ignored the games that called themselves art without apology,&#8221; and ends up &#8220;fail[ing] to capture what is beautiful in [the games that were included], and how much they resonate with the spirit of all the other works displayed in the museum.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/26/2972326/the-art-of-video-games-review" target="_blank">T.C. Sottek at The Verge</a> observes that &#8220;tech[nology] plays a dominating role in the exhibit.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Art of Video Games doesn&#8217;t talk back much to the viewer or take risks with its point of view. There is no overriding thesis here except for perhaps the obvious notion that games are a new and unique kind of art. As such, it doesn’t prompt many critical questions about the cultural or societal role of video games, or really explore the boundaries that decide what makes a game art as opposed to, say, mere entertainment.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree. The exhibit doesn&#8217;t really focus on change or development in video games other than graphics &#8212; the move from 8-bit games to the &#8220;bitwar&#8221; era, for example, and the shift from 2-dimensional worlds to three dimensions &#8212; and simply doesn&#8217;t have space for anything more than a blanket assertion that narrative in video games is much richer and deeper now that so many more tools are available to game developers.</p>
<p>Since the exhibition doesn&#8217;t really have the space or the tools to talk about what makes a successful narrative, I&#8217;ll settle for expressing my skepticism that better graphics or more powerful processors have any necessary connection to better narratives, and conclude instead with two more concrete criticisms.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m disappointed that &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221; seems to focus on video games as a phenomenon of the home console or PC to the exclusion of public play. This ignores both the fact that home consoles have historically often served to run low-powered imitations of games designed for public arcades, and the current proliferation of online play. This is especially frustrating when the failure to include some version or acknowledgement of the arcade in the exhibit&#8217;s play room seems like such a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Second, I can&#8217;t help coming away with the feeling that an art museum is the wrong venue for an exhibition on video games. Video games have always been so much more than the sum of their hardware and code, and putting them in a museum devoted to the visual arts must necessarily nudge games into occupying the position of being a thing to look at. While, say, a book or a chess set could well merit inclusion in an art museum as an object of physical beauty and artistic design, putting either on a wall or behind glass excludes some fundamental aspect of their artfulness. A book that cannot be read is not literature, and a chess board that is not in use cannot convey the history or beauty of the game of chess at play.</p>
<p>Books have libraries. Chess has clubs, tournaments, and tables set up in parks and other public places all over the world. If we want to get games to be taken more seriously as an art, maybe we need to make our play more visible and accessible, and create spaces where that can happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While summer reading lists tend to put one in mind of trashy paperbacks stashed away in canvas bags for beach reading, not many of us will spend the entire summer in a folding chair. Thus, a good set of summer reading suggestions will include options suitable for a variety of situations and pursuits. Whether you&#8217;re soaking up summer rays, trapped inside by a sudden summer storm, or looking for a different kind of summer getaway, this list should have you covered. (You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>
<p><strong>For those hot summer days:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10109" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/heat/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg" data-orig-size="271,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="heat" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=203" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=271" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&#038;h=150" alt="Heat" title="heat" width="101" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10109" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=202&amp;h=298 202w" sizes="(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px" /> Other than <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/18/quit-cooking-start-reading/">Jill&#8217;s Kolongowski&#8217;s recommendation</a> of Julia Child&#8217;s <em>My Life in Paris</em> (which is both an amazing book and actually about a lot more than just Child&#8217;s life in Paris), the most enjoyable food book you can add to your summer reading list is Bill Buford&#8217;s <em><strong>Heat: An Amateur&#8217;s Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany</strong></em>. Formerly Fiction Editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>, Buford leaves his magazine job to learn about cooking in Mario Batali&#8217;s restaurant Babbo shortly before the release of <em>The Babbo Cookbook</em>. It&#8217;s a time when the restaurant is both preparing for fresh critical scrutiny and tweaking the menu to move beyond the soon-to-be-published set of recipes. No one in the kitchen has the time or patience for a rank amateur in their midst, and Buford has to make the most of it &#8212; which he does with humor, humility, and aplomb. <em>Heat</em> is a welcome counterpoint for those of us put off a bit by the overwhelming bravado of Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s <em>Kitchen Confidential</em>, and things just get better when Buford heads off to Italy to study with some of Batali&#8217;s mentors.</p>
<p><strong>For those stormy summer nights:</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s actually some really amazing stuff in even the biggest mainstream comic books right now. Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo&#8217;s work on <em>Batman</em> is unbelievable (and in a different venue, I&#8217;d have written that word in all-caps AND bold AND italics), Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang&#8217;s work on <em>Wonder Woman</em> is everything the New 52 promised to do, a magnificent re-imagining of a classic (but too-often underutilized) character &#8212; the character designs alone are worth cover price &#8212; and Gail Simone&#8217;s <em>Batgirl</em> is a remarkable and psychologically gripping take on Barbara Gordon that manages to preserve most of what was wonderful about Simone&#8217;s time writing the character as Oracle. (This is high praise coming from me. I was really disappointed that <a href="http://gavinjcraig.com/2011/08/21/goodbye-batgirl-hello-batgirl/" target="_blank">DC was abandoning</a> <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2009/08/quick-break.html" target="_blank">Stephanie Brown</a> in order to bring back the Barbara Gordon Batgirl, although, in fairness, I might just be the only person in the world who feels that way.)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10116" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/batman-and-son/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg" data-orig-size="419,644" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Batman-and-Son" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=195" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=419" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&#038;h=150" alt="Batman and Son" title="Batman-and-Son" width="97" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10116" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&amp;h=150 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=194&amp;h=298 194w" sizes="(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px" /> But, assuming that you might not be the sort of person who visits a comic shop every month, let me recommend Grant Morrison&#8217;s current run on <em>Batman, Inc.</em> as the culmination of a story he&#8217;s been telling since 2006. Morrison is a writer whose work actually often reads better when it&#8217;s been collected into a trade volume where the reader can pick up all the visual and story clues he weaves together from month to month (which can often seem a bit obscure when you&#8217;re only getting 20ish pages at a time, with 30 or more days between installments). Morrison&#8217;s saga starts with <em><strong>Batman and Son</strong></em> (with a jaw-dropping first issue where Batman fights ninja man-bats in a Roy-Lichtenstein-inspired pop art exhibition), and continues in <em><strong>The Black Glove</strong></em> (with art by the no-less-than-absolutely-brilliant J. H. Williams III), <strong>Batman R.I.P.</strong>, <em><strong>Batman &amp; Robin Vol. 1: Batman Reborn</strong></em> (where Dick Grayson steps into the cape and cowl), <em><strong>Vol. 2: Batman vs. Robin</strong></em>, <em><strong>Vol. 3: Batman &amp; Robin Must Die</strong></em>, and finally, the pre-New 52 <strong><em>Batman, Incorporated</em></strong>. (Completists will include <em>Final Crisis</em> and <em>The Return of Bruce Wayne</em>, but you can get away without reading those two. Just know that Bruce Wayne dies, sort of, and then comes back.)</p>
<p>Like many &#8220;difficult&#8221; writers, the trick to reading Morrison is to just keep going. With Morrison in particular, you&#8217;ll get totally lost if you worry about making sense of everything. I think the big secret is that Morrison spends a lot less time worrying about whether he makes sense than building and keeping up a sort of narrative cadence and momentum. When you really get into him, you don&#8217;t so much read as excavate, digging up all the things that you didn&#8217;t realize were there at first, and finding yourself pulled into the most neglected and maligned corners of a character&#8217;s history, suddenly shown (well, skillfully retconned) to have been the most interesting and important thing all along.</p>
<p>But, having said that, you don&#8217;t need to know anything about Grant Morrison or even Batman to pick up <em>Batman and Son</em>. (Although, good luck putting it down once you&#8217;ve started.)</p>
<p><strong>For getting away from it all:</strong></p>

(If you&#8217;re looking for a fun AND smart book on video games, there&#8217;s always Tom Bissell&#8217;s <strong><em>Extra Lives</em></strong>, which <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2010/06/diary-of-casual-gamer-2-confessions-and.html" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>, or you can do what I do and crib from <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/" target="_blank">The Brainy Gamer</a>&#8216;s bookshelf.)</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t played it yet, go download Thatgamecompany&#8217;s <em><strong><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/18/three-meditations-on-journey/">Journey</a></strong></em> right now. There&#8217;s a collector&#8217;s edition disc coming out at the end of August (which will also include <em>Flower</em> and <em>Flow</em>), but don&#8217;t wait. Hell, download it now AND buy the disc in August. Anything to encourage people to make more games like this.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, <em>Journey</em> will only be available for the Playstation 3, so my apologies if you don&#8217;t own one. For everyone else, we can count <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect-3/Extended_Cut_Endings">the new <em>Mass Effect 3</em> endings</a> as narrative, right? Just for the summer?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a sojourner in a strange land. I started alone, climbing a sand dune to catch my first glimpse of a mountain with a brilliant light glowing at its peak. As I walked toward the mountain, I encountered a glowing mark which wrapped itself around my neck and gave me the ability to float through the air. I found living scraps of fabric which carried me to a platform where I closed my eyes and saw a figure in white.</p>
<p>That figure would return as I moved forward to show me the story of the world and the people who came before me.</p>
<p>There is a balance every narrative game has to find between what the game gives you, and what it leaves for you to find. My first trip through the game was carried almost entirely by what was given. There was the experience of the world as I traveled through it, and there was the story of the world as revealed in the visions/cutscenes between levels. Every vision showed a little bit of where I had been, a little bit of where I was to go next, and a little bit of what had happened. It&#8217;s brilliantly difficult to be more specific than that, as the visions are images entirely free of text.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on writing. The visions are iconographic &#8212; the graphemes it uses are representations of embodiment and embodied action, and like all representation, it operates by demanding interpretation. The revealed story &#8212; the story communicated through the visions &#8212; is perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous. Life, living cloth, both flora and fauna, emanate from the energy of the mountain. People begin to direct energy, first into greater cloths, and then into structures which use cloths as energy sources. The people attain great heights, and then the energy starts to flicker. There is a tearing of the cloth. New, terrible machines are built under storm and cloud. The world is covered in sand. A single traveler appears, and moves through the ruins of the world to the mountain.</p>
<p>All of this is recorded. All of this is shown. None of it is explained. None of it has meaning independent of the traveler and the player&#8217;s experience. The traveler reconstructs the story by moving to a place in the world where a new chapter can be told. While the story, like all stories, is dependent on an imagined past, the play itself re-creates the story from the very first play. Without the traveler, without the reader, without the player, the writing is just an encoded possibility, a hope for a story. Every book, every game, every story is a ghost, a trace, a breath waiting for a body to enliven.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a companion. I was initially indifferent to others. The game has a trophy given when the player encounters 10 other players within the game. I earned this trophy on my first playthrough, as I moved forward and left other players behind. The second time, however, I met a traveler in a white robe.</p>
<p>Unlike most games with online multiplayer functionality, <em>Journey</em> doesn&#8217;t give players a way to talk to each other using voice or text. Instead, you can press a button to make a noise (which varies in tune with the game&#8217;s soundtrack) and create a single luminescent glyph.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on language. Because you can &#8220;talk&#8221; quietly or loudly by tapping the button lightly or holding it down with greater pressure, the game&#8217;s single hailing action can be incredibly expressive. I soon realized that the other traveler was calling my attention to places in the world I should explore. I found new ruins, hidden flowers, and secret glyphs which added to the story told in the visions. We had a way to acknowledge each other, to keep track of each other, and, most interesting of all, to chatter. Sometimes our speech had a clear purpose &#8212; &#8220;Come over here!&#8221; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; &#8220;Can you see me?&#8221; &#8212; but sometimes it was more a way to share excitement, or nervousness, or wonder. That is, it was a conversation in which clear communication was taking place, but in which that communication was entirely indifferent to individual words. It was a striking reminder of how much of a conversation is carried by tone and context rather than grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>As we moved through the world, the traveler taught me, and I was able to say thank you. In the moments of greatest beauty, we sang to each other. We were not only acknowledging each other, but acknowledging the world, and participating in it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I returned to <em>Journey</em> after my two complete playthroughs for a number of smaller, partial attempts. After the game is completed, the end of the first, tutorial level becomes a gateway where the player can jump to any of the later levels, rather than having to play the whole game in order. I collected the glowing symbols I had missed. I found the final hidden glyphs. I earned a white robe of my own. I tried and failed to take on the role of teacher.</p>
<p>So the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I put the robe away. I gave up the external signs of experience, and simply entered the world again.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on humility. While the story is dependent upon the player as a reader, an actor, a participant, the world itself endures unchanged. In most games, replay value is measured by variability of outcome &#8212; different choices resulting in a different story, different actions leading to a higher score. <em>Journey</em> has no score, and the world, the symbols, the glyphs, the visions, and the outcome are the same every time. You may approach the mountain alone or with a companion, clothed in brown or white, with a long flowing scarf or with almost no scarf at all. The mountain always strips all of these things away. The end is always the same.</p>
<p>And yet <em>Journey</em> is the only video game I can think of which I&#8217;ve played from beginning to end three times.</p>
<p>And the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I met a traveler. Somehow, I was better as a guide in the brown robe instead of the white, and I showed my companion the better paths. As we approached the mountain, in the final wind and snow, we were separated, and I did something I had never done before. I waited. When my companion was blown from the path, I sat in one place so that she could climb back and we could finish the journey together. Even then, somehow, she got ahead of me without my having seen her, and I found myself rising to catch up. I&#8217;m still not sure if I was mistaken somehow about her having lost the path, or if I was inattentive, or if she found a new way. None of these things seems likely, but I know for certain that we were separated and found each other further ahead. My patience, apparently, was nothing compared to my companion&#8217;s, as she waited for me to finish waiting for her. We entered the mountain together, to begin again, alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I saw the world.</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I learned the language.</p>
<p>The third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was part of the world.</p>
<p>I may yet return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 50 very pleasant hours playing BioWare&#8217;s <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, I&#8217;m at something of a loss to make sense of what just happened. Perhaps it&#8217;s useful to begin with my description of those 50 hours as &#8220;pleasant,&#8221; which isn&#8217;t quite correct. There was a tremendous &#8212; and very interesting &#8212; tension at work during my gameplay. I was often in something of a hurry, as the are very specific constraints on my play time, and portions of the <em>Mass Effect 2</em> experience are supremely slow. I found myself cringing every time I needed to move beyond my immediate surroundings by taking a shuttle to a new landing site or docking at a city. Even taking the elevator between levels on Commander Shepard&#8217;s ship the Normandy meant an interminable wait staring at a loading screen. The <em>Mass Effect</em> universe is a place constantly tottering on the brink of total collapse, with each of the various societies Shepard encounters pleading for intervention in the final minutes of their darkest hour, but there&#8217;s no particular urgency. If Shepard receives a report of a ship in danger of falling into a planet&#8217;s atmosphere, the player can rely on the event to not actually occur until Shepard has leisure enough to make the trip.</p>
<p>In fact, the unintended implication of <em>Mass Effect</em>&#8216;s episodic but non-sequential narrative architecture may be that the truly moral choice would be for Shepard to fly from system to system but never actually land. Each of the distress calls would continue to beckon, preserved in a stasis where some existential danger has been comprehended, but eternally delayed. I like to imagine entire generations living their whole lives on that ship, passing the story of the hero who will come to save them to their children and their children&#8217;s children. It&#8217;s an appealing counternarrative to the adolescent fantasy of an individual hero whose labors succeed where armies, scientists, and politicians have failed. It would also save the player from having to wait for all of those loading screens.</p>
<p>Even so, while it may not be quite right to speak of my time playing the game as pleasant, I have to acknowledge that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> was a rich experience. Peter Brooks<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> argues that a great deal of the pleasure of narrative comes not just from knowing the ending, but in the postponement of the ending, and in that light, <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a masterpiece. The plot of <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is actually pretty thin &#8212; Shepard dies (why not?), is brought back to figure out who is kidnapping entire human colonies, a crew is recruited, some navigational information is recovered, and everyone flies to the center of the galaxy to save the world and learn a little something about themselves.</p>
<p>But while the main story itself doesn&#8217;t give the player that much to do, there are a million ways to put off doing that handful of things. Every character Shepard recruits wants something, and expects Shepard to get, save, and/or destroy it for them. While I think BioWare would argue that these errands constitute a major part of the main storyline &#8212; and they did indeed compose a significant fraction of my play time &#8212; they&#8217;re also entirely optional. More importantly, in terms of the narrative architecture, making the character loyalty missions optional means that they have to be entirely independent of each other. Nothing that you do on any one loyalty mission can directly affect any other because the game can&#8217;t assume that you&#8217;ve completed (or will ever complete) any specific mission before completing another. Without that necessary sequential relation, there is no room for causes and effects. Each mission is its own context, meaning, and self-contained consequence, and Shepard remains a blank state onto which entire civilizations can project their hopes and fears, a knight-errant.</p>
<p>While BioWare is famous for their choice-centered <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/04/22/mass-effect/">good or evil/light side vs. dark side/paragon vs. renegade</a> gameplay, and for creating game franchises where the choices made in earlier games carry over into sequels, these choices can necessarily have only marginal impacts. If the player makes a choice that results in a character&#8217;s death in an earlier game, then this character will not show up in the sequel, but since each game must be created to encompass both the possibility that character X is alive and dead, then characters from earlier games <em>must</em> be limited to secondary (or cameo) roles in later games. Commercial constraints mean that BioWare cannot create a <em>Mass Effect 3</em> which cannot be beaten (or is ultimately any less rich of an experience) if any single character is killed in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. (Imagine, for example, a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> where it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether Boromir or Aragorn dies. Tolkien would not have been able to make Aragorn so central to the plot of the second book, and so absolutely critical to the resolution of the war. Boromir&#8217;s death would be robbed of its classically tragic nobility.)</p>
<p>The result is that each game demands that you assemble a new cast of characters, and largely abandon your previous crew. Relationships still exist, sort of, but of necessity cannot be central to the action or narrative development of the new game. There are major choices in <em>Mass Effect 2</em> that promise to impact <em>Mass Effect 3</em> &#8212; you can strengthen or decimate the Geth, you can deliver the Collector base to Cerberus or destroy it &#8212; but these decisions cannot do much more than change a handful of cutscenes. (The outcome of the war does not really depend on whether you win the loyalty of Rohan or tell them off.)</p>
<p>None of which is to say that you shouldn&#8217;t play <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. It&#8217;s an extraordinary game in terms of visuals, setting, and characterization, but it&#8217;s a triumph of storytelling and not of story, of world building and not of narrative. Raph Koster has argued that <a href="http://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/20/narrative-is-not-a-game-mechanic/" target="_blank">&#8220;Narrative is not a game mechanic&#8221;</a> &#8212; that is that narrative in video games is not a central operation of the game itself but a way for the game to provide feedback to a player who is navigating the game&#8217;s essentially non-narrative problem set (mash button, kill monster, steer car, etc.). I&#8217;m not totally convinced by Koster&#8217;s argument, but <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a pretty strong example of what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a picaresque (and a good one) and not a novel. It&#8217;s a convincing illusion of a world in which the player has agency and choices have persistent effects, even though the overarching story does its best to undo those effects. None of these observations are meant to be criticisms of the quality of the game. In fact, most of them could be addressed if BioWare were designing individual, standalone games rather than franchises. It&#8217;s not the mechanic/narrative interface that defeats the possibility of player choices from having a significant and lasting impact on the narrative world, it&#8217;s the lack of a clear and specific endpoint.</p>
<p>The world doesn&#8217;t end, and because the world continues, the game has to account for all the choices the player <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make.</p>
<p>So do enjoy <em>Mass Effect 2</em> &#8212; I did &#8212; but don&#8217;t feel bad if you take your time about it. The world will wait for you.</p>

<td><strong>XBox 360 with Kinect</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/01/the-casual-gamers-after-holiday-list/">Last year</a>, the PS2 was my console recommendation, based on the assumption that &#8220;Casual Gamer&#8221; readers are either relative non-gamers, or already own whatever console(s) they really want. This year, coming to the end of the lifespan of the current generation of consoles, prices are down, game libraries are deep, and there&#8217;s really no reason not to pick up a Playstation 3 or an XBox 360. As a game system, Blu-ray player, and Netflix streaming hub, my own PS3 is the most important device hooked up to my TV. However, for the entry-level gamer, or the advanced gamer looking for something different, I&#8217;d recommend the Kinect. I&#8217;m still not totally sure that motion control will ever take over gaming, but it really doesn&#8217;t need to. Having had the chance to (finally) try the Wii, the Playstation Move, and the Kinect, I&#8217;m willing to say that if motion control has a future, it&#8217;s the Kinect. The Move is a genuine advancement over the Wii (to be fair, so is the Wii Motion Plus), but only the Kinect is able in a single device to let players use hands, feet, body, and head as inputs. I&#8217;m not one much for dance games, but I&#8217;d argue that only games using the Kinect are even worth the name. Microsoft is selling a bundle with a 4 GB hard drive for $299, but installing the Kinect takes up nearly that much space by itself, so spending the extra $100 for the 250 GB bundle is really worth it.</td>

<td><strong>Playstation Network card<br />
or<br />
XBox Points card</strong></p>
<p>One of the big reasons that I&#8217;m recommending the XBox over a PS3 is the vibrancy of XBox Live Arcade over Playstation Network (also, to my knowledge, XBox Live wasn&#8217;t hacked this year), but both PSN and XBox Live Arcade have a lot to offer, from downloadable supplements to games your favorite gamer already owns, to games like <em>Limbo</em> (which finally came to PSN after being released for XBox Live Arcade in 2010). PSN also has a lot of Playstation 1 games available on PSN, and they&#8217;ve started to add PS2 games, which may finally, finally make my old PS2 hardware obsolete. (I&#8217;m not holding my breath.)</td>

<td><strong><em>Batman: Arkham City</em></strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t play enough new games to feel comfortable arguing for <em>Arkham City</em> as the best game of the year &#8212; for a better discussion on that subject, check out Slate&#8217;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/features/2011/the_gaming_club/el_shaddai_ascension_of_the_metatron_is_my_early_front_runner_for_game_of_the_year_.html" target="_blank">Gaming Club</a> or Gamasutra&#8217;s <a href="http://gamasutra.com/view/news/39199/Gamasutras_Best_Of_2011_Top_10_Games_Of_The_Year.php" target="_blank">Top Ten of 2011</a> &#8212; but as a self-avowed Batman fanatic, <em>Arkham City</em> just nudged out <em>Portal 2</em> as the most fun I had playing this year. (It was close. Really close. <em>Portal 2</em> is great. In fact, I might just change my mind if I can finally coordinate schedules with someone and get through the multiplayer levels.) The main storyline was fun, if not as tight as <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, but it was the Riddler that really made the game for me. I chased down all the Riddler trophies in <em>Arkham Asylum</em>, and the audio of the Riddler&#8217;s arrest was fun, but having to solve new puzzles to rescue kidnapped medical workers in <em>Arkham City</em> was a far, far better reward for my obsessive-compulsive pursuit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exactly a top ten list, but <em>The Ico and Shadow of the Colossus of the Collection</em> and the <em>Heavy Rain: Game of the Year Edition</em> are well worth picking up. You may already have <em>Heavy Rain</em> or <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> (in which case the re-releases aren&#8217;t worth an additional investment), but <em>Ico</em> in particular has been nearly impossible to find, and giving it an HD release is just good karma.</td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s possible to be too clever. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it&#8217;s possible to be too fond of what one views as one&#8217;s own cleverness. As an example, let me put forward the column &#8220;Diary of a Casual Gamer,&#8221; for which as much as I enjoy the title, and referring to myself as &#8220;The Casual Gamer,&#8221; I&#8217;ve written exactly one entry about a casual game: <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/01/click-click-click-2/">&#8220;Click, click, click,&#8221;</a> about the Facebook game <em>Mafia Wars</em>.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I think &#8220;Click, click, click&#8221; is still pretty good, mostly because I spent more time writing it than most of the other pieces I&#8217;ve written for the site. I&#8217;ve tried to stay true to the &#8220;diary&#8221; part of my title, writing as much as possible about the games I&#8217;m playing at any particular time, giving my more-or-less off-the-cuff impressions, and trying to be smart and entertaining while doing so. Sometimes I do pretty well. Sometimes, I just do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diary of a Casual Gamer,&#8221; however, got started while I was writing for a different site. Kevin Mattison had been doing some film writing for a site called Ditching Otis, and I jumped at the chance to reach out to a broader (or at least different) audience than was reading my personal blog. Ditching Otis seemed fun, had a couple of good writers, and used a photo of Nietzsche wearing steampunk goggles as its logo. Good times were had by all.</p>
<p>Until the dude who ran Ditching Otis shut it down, totally and without any warning. One morning it was just gone. I probably should have taken the ads selling gold investments on the side of the page as a warning. Kevin spent a day or two trying to talk the dude into giving it another go, but it wasn&#8217;t long before we decided that we could do a better job ourselves. And without tooting our own horn too much, we did. After all, had you ever heard of Ditching Otis before this column? (Seriously, eff that guy. He was a Ayn-Rand-loving, self-centered douchebag who shut down Ditching Otis because he decided that he wasn&#8217;t going to make any money off a site he wasn&#8217;t paying people to contribute to. Whereas I&#8217;m a charming, self-centered socialist who takes pride in not making a penny off a site I&#8217;m not paying people to contribute to. Totally different.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already highlighted <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/08/30/year-one-editors-picks/">a number of my favorite <em>Idler</em> pieces from our first year</a>, but if I&#8217;m supposed to be talking about the writing that has had the most impact on my own, then I really need to give credit to Andrew Simone, whose list of <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/02/essential-indie-games/">&#8220;Essential indie games&#8221;</a> and link to <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/06/16/my-desperate-search/">Brandon Boyer&#8217;s GDC microtalk</a> have had a huge impact on my thinking about what video games are and should be doing, and Kate Sloan, who reminded me how much I love comics, and that there&#8217;s a lot of really great, really smart ground left to cover in writing about Batman.</p>
<p>And dear god, you know, everyone else! I read everything that goes up on <em>The Idler</em>, and the fact that <em>The Idler</em>&#8216;s writers still surprise, inform, and entertain me (and thus, hopefully, our readers) is what keeps the site going.</p>
<p>I know I asked everyone to talk about what they wanted to do in the next year, but I&#8217;m going to exert editor&#8217;s prerogative and decline to do the same. (Other than to say that the &#8220;Gamers&#8217; Club&#8221; will be making a return in the next couple of weeks, and we&#8217;ll be playing the SNES game <em>Earthbound</em>.) What I&#8217;m looking forward to most about the next year is continuing to be surprised by <em>The Idler</em>&#8216;s writers. I wouldn&#8217;t want to spoil it for anyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games are a troublesome medium. Rogert Ebert, famously, <a target="new" href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html">isn&#8217;t convinced that they&#8217;re art</a>. Even those of us who love video games are often apologetic. Yes, many video games are just terrible. Yes, it&#8217;s true that no video game can stand up to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or Beethoven&#8217;s Fifth Symphony, or <em>Ulysses</em>. (Or maybe <em>War &amp; Peace</em>, if you&#8217;re the sort of person who doesn&#8217;t like <em>Ulysses</em>. I happen to like <em>Ulysses</em>.)</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m primarily interested in video games as a medium for narrative and story, not despite but because I think it&#8217;s an open question whether video games are particularly well-suited to narrative.</p>
<p>In fact, depending on what and how you read, the idea of video games as a venue for narrative is in trouble right now. This week, IGN ran a piece on <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/118/1185726p1.html" target="_blank">the end of the $60 single-disc big-budget video game</a> in favor of less-expensive segmented downloads. (This business model is actually not all that far from a lot of &#8220;single-disc&#8221; games, which offer players the opportunity to purchase and download additional content &#8212; &#8220;DLC&#8221; &#8212; after the initial purchase of the physical disc. It just eliminates the requirement that the player buy the disc first.) <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6828237/beyond-angry-birds" target="_blank">Tom Bissell&#8217;s piece in Grantland</a> makes explicit the implied stakes of the low-cost, low-budget gaming world to come:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few months ago, a producer at a major video-game company startled me by admitting that the economic viability of the triple-A video-game production cycle — the expensive development process, in other words, by which games like Halo, Grand Theft Auto, Uncharted, and BioShock are unleashed upon the world — is in all likelihood doomed. Shortly after that, a developer told me he has a hard time imagining how single-player narrative video games are going to survive in the long run; such games, he believes, will eventually be seen as a historical anomaly. Neither man was particularly thrilled to imagine a future largely absent of the kinds of games he makes and most cares about, but current trends could not be ignored.</p>
<p>I told the developer that he sounded a bit like my fiction-writer friends going on about the inevitable death of the novel. &#8220;It takes one person to write a novel,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;To make the kinds of games we&#8217;re talking about, you need several dozen people — probably more like a hundred — with training across several fields. If the money&#8217;s not there, which is increasingly the case, the games can&#8217;t be made.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that Bissell&#8217;s skepticism of the developer&#8217;s assertion is well-founded. The sky may well be falling, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that everything is coming to an end. Much like the death of the studio system that controlled prewar American filmmaking, the end of a particular business model will not mean the end of a medium.</p>
<p>While Bissell&#8217;s piece focuses on iPad games, including a number that tell stories surprisingly well, I&#8217;d like to try to shift the terms of the conversation a bit. (An ambitious goal, I know, but I&#8217;m going to take for granted that <em>Idler</em> readers will know from Andrew Simone&#8217;s writing that <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/02/essential-indie-games/" target="_blank">indie/web browser games can tell outstanding and challenging stories with incredibly limited resources</a>.)</p>
<p>First, there is a central mistake in considering whether video games as a medium are well-suited for narrative. The implied analogy is between video games and a genre like the novel or the fiction film, where narrative tools are built into the conceptual framework of the work itself. Video games, however, are a <em>medium</em> and not a <em>genre</em>. The more appropriate analogy would be between the video game and the book. Video games, like books, can be a productive venue for narrative, but like books, video games can be successful entirely independent of whether narrative exists within the individual work, and the success, failure, or indifference of the individual work is immaterial to the larger question as to whether narrative can work within a video game. A book of poetry may entirely ignore narrative, but it would be foolish to conclude from the fact that many great books exist which contain no narrative all that books are ill-suited to telling stories.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-media comparisons can be occasionally illuminating, but to judge video games by the narrative standards and conventions of the novel, opera, drama, or the fiction film is ultimately a mistake. Will video games ever produce a <em>Ulysses</em>? Clearly not. <em>Ulysses</em> already exists. Video games would (and do) do better to measure by and build on its own benchmarks.</p>
<p>And video games <em>do</em> tell some compelling stories, using their own tools, and with their own unique strengths and flaws. Rather than figuring out whether <em>Heavy Rain</em> is as good as your favorite novelist, however, let&#8217;s talk about what makes its story work, and try to imagine what stories video games could (and should) be telling, especially if the big-budget, risk-averse, &#8220;let&#8217;s-make-another-sequel&#8221; business model comes crashing down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my challenge to video game critics, players, and creators. I&#8217;ll do what I can to live up to it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent a number of years working in a bookstore in the early 00s, starting shortly after the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> in 2000. For a character who has appeared in books, films, toys, stickers, a theme park, and who knows what else, it&#8217;s always amusing for me to remember that at the time there was no merchandise at all. As the bookstore industry even then was moving to include more of what was called &#8220;sidelines&#8221; on the sales floor, this disposed us to look on the Harry Potter books fondly and J. K. Rowling as one of us: A book person. We relished the stories of Jo, a single mother, writing <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> in a coffee shop. We thought of all the money even then that she was turning down by not selling stuffed owls, or plastic broomsticks.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6289" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6289" data-attachment-id="6289" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/23/books-brooms-and-bad-video-games/hpvibratingbroom/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg" data-orig-size="348,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HPVibratingBroom" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=209" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=348" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=208&#038;h=300" alt="Broom" title="HPVibratingBroom" width="208" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6289" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=208&amp;h=300 208w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=104&amp;h=150 104w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6289" class="wp-caption-text">Remember why they took this off the market?</p></div> This, of course, all changed with the release of the film version of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> in 2001. I don&#8217;t remember all the details, because I tried not to pay attention, but I&#8217;m sure there were Harry Potter Happy Meals as well as the coloring books, posters, picture books, and other movie tie-ins that took over my bookstore. It was the end of a particular innocence that we as bookstore people should probably never have lulled ourselves into. Jo was still clearly a wonderful writer, but she wasn&#8217;t just a book person. She wasn&#8217;t one of <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>And you know what? None of that matters. The books, the films, the fan art and fiction, all of it is worth every cheap piece of plastic sold with a Harry Potter logo. Harry Potter is <em>better</em> as something more than a book.</p>
<p>I make this assertion with some confidence, having read all the books (I started late, but I caught up fast), seen all the films (except the last one &#8212; I&#8217;ll get there), and having spent more time buried in Harry Potter lexicons, fan-written stories, and Wikipedia entries than I care to admit.</p>
<p>Which brings me to a rather odd admission: There have been a host of Harry Potter video games &#8212; at least one for every film, and even a <em>Quidditch World Cup</em> game in 2003 &#8212; and <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> is the only one I&#8217;ve ever played. (You can read my final word on that game <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/">here</a>, in case you missed it.) As much as I love Harry Potter, I avoid Harry Potter video games like the plague because movie tie-in video games are almost universally terrible.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6290" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6290" data-attachment-id="6290" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/23/books-brooms-and-bad-video-games/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png" data-orig-size="256,364" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Harry_Potter_-_Quidditch_World_Cup_Coverart" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=211" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=256" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=210&#038;h=300" alt="HP Quidditch" title="Harry_Potter_-_Quidditch_World_Cup_Coverart" width="210" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6290" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=210&amp;h=300 210w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png?w=105&amp;h=150 105w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/harry_potter_-_quidditch_world_cup_coverart.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6290" class="wp-caption-text">I actually almost bought this game.</p></div> In all honesty, this is a travesty. Adaptations should strengthen great characters and storylines. The plain fact of getting to encounter a character and story in a new form, not to mention all the little (or big) tweaks and changes necessary to make a story work in a different medium all <em>add</em> something to the greater whole. The book changes the way we see the film, and the film changes the way we read the book. Even running around on a cheap plastic broom changes the way we think about a Quidditch match, at least a little bit.</p>
<p>Video games should be a full-fledged part of this cross-media narrative exchange, and the only reason that they are not is that they are produced quickly and rushed to market, almost always constrained by the aesthetic and narrative determinations of the film they rehash. Even thinking of a game as an adaptation in its own right, rather than a marketing and merchandising tool, would be a huge step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Even better would be a game that tells a story of its own, in the universe suggested by but not limited to that created by a book or a film. There are plenty of good examples of this, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_Game" target="_blank">the 1998 <em>X-Files</em> PC game</a>, to the recent <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Shattered_Dimensions" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Edge_of_Time" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Edge of Time</a></em> games. (And, of course, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum" target="_blank">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>.) The best adaptations tell their own stories, and the Harry Potter theme park in Orlando proves every day that there are large numbers of people who would leap at the opportunity to live in Harry Potter&#8217;s world for a while (or longer than a while).</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to make a suggestion. Who knows? The internet is a big place. Maybe, just maybe, word will get back to Jo herself. We need a new Harry Potter video game. Not one that revisits all the films in one 100+ hour multi-disc game. Not even a Harry Potter MMORPG. (Which would probably sell like gangbusters, and might even be cool, but it&#8217;s a little too obvious a place to start.) No, what I want is a game based solely on the Battle of Hogwarts and the preceding year at the school, maybe from Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley&#8217;s point of view. I want the story that we didn&#8217;t get in the book <em>or</em> the film. I want to get to flesh out two great characters who do really important things even though we don&#8217;t see that much of them while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out camping. I want to direct the defense of the school. I want to cut off Nagini&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>You could probably even sell some controllers shaped like Godric Gryffindor&#8217;s sword. It would be worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>That is, I&#8217;m not quite done, but I&#8217;m <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>I own several of the Traveler&#8217;s Tales LEGO video games. I&#8217;ve played the first two <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games on my GameCube. I unlocked all of the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Jedi on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. I played <em>LEGO Batman</em> on my Playstation 2. I unlocked all the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Hero or True Villain on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. And now that I&#8217;ve played <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> on my Playstation 3, I think I can safely ignore <em>LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars</em>, and <em>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean</em>. </p>
<p>In fact, I don&#8217;t think I need to play a LEGO video game ever again.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6144" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6144" data-attachment-id="6144" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/168244-5-screenshot/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg" data-orig-size="608,456" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="168244-5-screenshot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=608" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Lockhart" title="168244-5-screenshot" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-6144" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=600&amp;h=450 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/168244-5-screenshot.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6144" class="wp-caption-text">Gilderoy Lockhart. Annoying in the book. Annoying in the game.</p></div> According to <em>LEGO Harry Potter</em>&#8216;s completion stats, I&#8217;m 98.7% done. I&#8217;ve earned True Wizard on every level, collected all 20 of red bonus bricks, all 24 of the house crest pieces, unlocked 166 of the 167 characters, rescued 49 of the 50 students in peril, and collected 198 of the 200 gold bricks. Even for all this, I&#8217;m closer to done than it sounds. And further away. You earn a gold block for rescuing students, so I actually have just one student and one more gold brick to find. Finding all 200 gold bricks unlocks a bonus level, where I&#8217;d find the final character, Lord Voldemort. So I have just three tasks left to complete. Except that I can&#8217;t find that last student in peril, or that last gold brick. I&#8217;ve even consulted the cheat guides, but there are just too many students in peril, and too many gold bricks. I&#8217;m not sure which one of each is the one I&#8217;m missing, so I don&#8217;t know what to go looking for. I&#8217;ve tried to systematically make my way through Hogwarts, but clearly I&#8217;m missing something. And there&#8217;s a substantial amount of time involved in walking again through Hogwarts, with its many twists and turns, in anything resembling a thorough fashion.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not fun.</p>
<p>In another game, that might be less of a criticism. In another game, the rewards would be set up differently. I might need to spend more time grinding to bring my characters up to a level where they&#8217;re strong enough to explore a new area without getting killed, but the payoff would be new weapons and armor, new side quests and new storylines. I might have to keep practicing until I could jump and grab and balance just right, but the reward would be access to a new level with new challenges.</p>
<p>In the LEGO games, the only reward is the sense of completion. Lord Voldemort may be the final character, but within the LEGO games, all the members of a particular character class are pretty much identical, except for the aesthetics. There&#8217;s nothing that Lord Voldemort can do that any other dark wizard can&#8217;t do, except to earn me a couple of trophies. (Which again, give you nothing but bragging rights and a sense of completion.)</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6150" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6150" data-attachment-id="6150" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/1-flying_harry/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg" data-orig-size="720,405" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="1-Flying_Harry" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360" alt="Quidditch" title="1-Flying_Harry" width="640" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-6150" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=640&amp;h=360 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/1-flying_harry.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6150" class="wp-caption-text">Has anyone ever made sense of Quidditch? Or those white pants?</p></div>
<p>Even worse, when you do finally complete the game, there&#8217;s literally nothing else to do. Once you have 100% and all the trophies, there&#8217;s no reason to come back and keep playing. You really may as well just sell the game.</p>
<p>And at least for me, there&#8217;s something wrong with that. I <em>want</em> to have a reason to keep my old games on the shelf. It appeals to the collector in me. But as obsessive as I am, I still can&#8217;t justify holding on to a game where there&#8217;s actually less reason to play through a level once you&#8217;ve done it the first time. It&#8217;s still fun to ride around the Old West as John (or Jack) Marston. It&#8217;s still fun to solve the puzzles in <em>Portal</em> and <em>Portal 2</em>, and to stumble on a line of dialogue from GLaDOS or Wheatley that you missed the first time through. Once you&#8217;ve found all the hidden items in the LEGO games, however, they&#8217;re gone, so while most of the levels are designed to require at least two playthroughs to find all the bonus items, there&#8217;s no incentive to keep coming back. There&#8217;s actually less to each level than there was the first time through.</p>
<p>It may be part of the problem that I&#8217;m a <em>Harry Potter</em> fan, and the somewhat humorously mimed version of the storyline in the games actually impedes enjoyment of the game. It may be that the <em>Star Wars</em> movies were ripe for some light parody, and there are enough campy takes on the <em>Batman</em> rogues&#8217; gallery that the silly, over-the-top feel of the LEGO version seemed like a good fit. But the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe, as it develops, becomes much, much darker. Without that sense of genuine menace, there&#8217;s little reason to watch as several hundred pages of character and plot are crammed into a few minutes of animated charades.</p>
<p>More than anything else, my gameplay has become pathological. I&#8217;m searching and searching for those last few items just because I&#8217;m so close to that magical but totally arbitrary 100%. I&#8217;m frustrated, and I&#8217;m just wasting time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not having any fun.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t need to do that.</p>
<p>Unless they make another <em>Batman</em> game. . .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not a post about <em>Portal 2</em>, even though I&#8217;ve been playing the game so much that my wife has started to make cracks about me loving the game more than her. (It&#8217;s not true, just in case you&#8217;re wondering. I&#8217;ve been chasing trophies in the single-player game while I wait for the PSN co-op mode to come back up. Or to get someone to use my second controller here. Maybe my wife. . .)</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m going talk about the first <em>Portal</em>, released for the PS3 as part of <em>The Orange Box</em> in 2007. It&#8217;s kind of hard to track down in that form these days, even though the XBox version is $20, and everywhere. If you can&#8217;t track it down for your PS3, you can play it on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, VALVEe&#8217;s online gaming community on your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever played the original <em>Portal</em>, <em>Portal 2</em> makes total sense. <em>Portal 2</em> gives you new puzzle pieces, and larger, more varied environments, but it does such an incredible job of building a rich, multilayered world using the same tools as the original <em>Portal</em>, that it&#8217;s easy to forget how unique and engagingly odds those tools were the first time around.</p>
<p><em>Portal</em> initially presents itself as a perfectly transparent environment. You wake up in a glass cube, and you are instructed to enter a series of chambers where you use a portal gun and a number of environmental objects to solve twenty spacial/sequential puzzles. You&#8217;re told at the beginning where the endpoint is going to be&mdash;with the exception of the first &#8220;00&#8221; chamber, each test chamber is numbered 1/19, 2/19, etc.</p>
<p>Until, of course, the whole thing goes off the rails. GLaDOS, the malevolent artificial intelligence whose voice guides and taunts you in turns, is actually trying to kill you. (There are hints throughout the game that she&#8217;s done this before.) The final puzzle ends with a platform slowly lowering itself into molten metal. After escaping from this deathtrap, you have to find your way through the machinery behind the puzzle rooms and eventually to GLaDOS herself, whom you have to destroy.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways of looking at <em>Portal</em>. It&#8217;s a wildly entertaining puzzle game. <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/f/classicradar-portal-is-the-most-subversive-game-ever/a-20110321105926471036/p-2" target="_blank">It&#8217;s the most subversive first-person shooter ever created.</a> It&#8217;s a master class on <a href="http://scrawledinwax.com/2010/06/16/the-ideology-valve-then-there-will-be-cake-guest-post/" target="_blank">game design which leads you forward on a specific path while persuading you that you&#8217;ve found the way yourself</a>. I&#8217;d like to argue, however, that <em>Portal</em> is a remarkable illustration of the distinction (in video games) between architecture and genre, and the results that are possible when you exploit and break down genre conventions.</p>

<p>Sorting <em>Portal</em> into a specific genre is a bit tricky. While the game is built on a first-person shooter engine (much like VALVe&#8217;s <em>Half Life</em> series), it&#8217;s really impossible to describe the game itself as a first-person shooter. You don&#8217;t really have a gun. There are almost no enemies to be killed, and the dangers you face are largely environmental&mdash;water hazards, physical obstacles that will push you off of moving platforms, and stationary turrets that will shoot you on sight but will shut down if you simply knock them over. In fact, <em>Portal</em> is constructed as a puzzle game where the world explodes at the end. After twenty increasingly complex discrete environments, you &#8220;escape&#8221; into space. You climb rusty stairs and squeeze between heavy machinery. It&#8217;s no longer clear where the endpoint will be. At times it seems that GLaDOS can see you, and at times you appear to be undetectable. You keep trying to move forward, although from time to time you have to stop to figure out where exactly forward is.</p>
<p>The twenty-first &#8220;escape&#8221; level is by far the longest level in <em>Portal</em>, although it&#8217;s still clearly designed to be completed in a single session. When I played for the first time, you couldn&#8217;t have convinced me to turn it off. My heart raced, and I&#8217;m a bit ashamed to say that for the first time in the game I resorted to some online guides when I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out what to do next. I didn&#8217;t want to stop and save and think. I had to keep running. I didn&#8217;t feel safe in any particular spot, not usually because of any direct, impending danger, but because I suddenly had no idea of what would happen next. I knew I was headed toward a confrontation with GLaDOS, but I didn&#8217;t have any idea what I could possibly use as a weapon. While I loved all the puzzle levels, and imagined myself writing an article about how the game largely removed itself from time&mdash;that is, most of the puzzles aren&#8217;t based on reflexes so much as figuring out how to use a tool to solve a problem&mdash;but the final level creates a compelling sense of urgency, largely because of the idyllic timeless abstraction of the earlier levels.</p>
<p>Which, in the end, is <em>Portal</em>&#8216;s big secret. It&#8217;s not a first-person shooter. It&#8217;s not a puzzle game where the world explodes at the end. If you take the narrative seriously, <em>Portal</em> is actually a single-level game with a clever twenty-stage tutorial. <em>Portal 2</em> reinforces this. While there are recognizable puzzle levels&mdash;and part of the fun of <em>Portal 2</em> is the way that aesthetics, the different &#8220;skins&#8221; that are draped over the same wire-frame 3D architecture are used to convey time, setting, and story&mdash;the puzzle levels exist to teach you how to use the increasing variety of tools that you need to use to navigate the spaces between worlds. Even more so, the puzzles themselves exist within the worlds this time, giving you more frequent opportunities to peek outside, and occasionally to move in and out of the puzzle spaces.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s all built on a single fascinating twenty-stage tutorial.</p>
