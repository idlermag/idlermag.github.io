Too  much.</p></div> But how to celebrate?  </p>
<p>If I had my way I’d gather and lock all my favorite people into a room and we’d gorge on the tasty insides of Discovery Channel television and snack until we were sick!  But, as I am once again in a new state, and with Husband beating the heat in Russia, and Simon Pegg not returning my calls (what? I said I wanted all my favorite people) I was stuck alone at home, glum, on the brink of an epic quadranscentennial week of shark television.</p>
<p>In order to keep my loneliness at bay and maintain my enthusiasm for my favorite week of the year, I decided I would nevertheless celebrate Shark Week on my own by combining two of my favorite things: Sharks and Food (Is this healthy? This might not be healthy).</p>
<p>In a fit of inspiration (and boredom) I began to flesh out my idea for a Shark Week themed treat.  I didn’t feel like carving up a shark watermelon or actively searching out a precise recipe.  I didn’t have the attention span for that sort of nonsense. I decided to wing it with some baking.</p>
<p>Yes, I know baking is usually <a href="https://idlermag.com/author/jkolongowski/">Jill’s area</a>, but I promise I yelled really loud across our great state to ask her if she would be okay with me writing about baking.  I took the silence to mean I should probably just go for it.  </p>
<p>After a late lunch/early dinner of sushi (yes, this was on purpose), I got started.</p>

<p>I gathered my baking supplies and iPod so The Mountain Goats (and sometimes Adele) could keep me company.  I tried not to feel too depressed I was baking for one and instead focused on how awesome this might turn out.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup>  I also kept in mind that, in the end, I would be entitled to share my bounty of cupcakes with exactly no one while watching <em>Air Jaws Apocalypse</em> (these are the thoughts that urge me onwards in times of trial, you guys).</p>
<p>The plan was simple:  Make bloody adorable Lemon Shark cupcakes.</p>
<p>I picked a <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-white-cake/" target="_blank">simple white cake recipe</a> and added the zest of two lemons and a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, hoping this would all end up as lemony as possible and not gross.</p>
<p>Once the batter was mixed I separated about a half cup of batter away from the batch to dye red.  The rest got blue like Tobias Funke. </p>

This was happening!</p>
<p>Once the cupcakes were in the oven I started to clean up, and then realized cleaning sucks and I should have a drink while I washed dishes.  I highly recommend wine (and more Adele) for this part of the solitary baking process.</p>
<p>30 minutes later, the cupcakes were done.  The next thing to do while they cooled was to start fixing the butter cream frosting.  Yes, I know there are ready available frostings I could have bought at the store, but that’s not how I roll.  Don’t tell me how to live my life!</p>
<p>The butter cream was going to take about 20 minutes of mixing, so I stuck the cakes in the fridge to make sure they’d be ready when the frosting was.</p>
<p>Guys? 20 minutes of mixing is a long time to watch a machine spin butter and sugar around all by yourself.</p>
<p>I had some more wine.</p>

<p>Soon the cakes were cooled and the frosting was finished.  After filling the cupcakes with strawberry jam I tried to be one with the ocean as I squeezed my delectable ocean blue (read: as blue as I could get it because I ran out of dye) frosting from my pastry bag into little cupcake sized waves. I added a yummy candy lemon fruit slice dorsal fin on top, and voilà!</p>
<p>Strawberry/Lemon Shark Cupcakes!</p>

<p>The lemon really came through in the cake, and the strawberry jam was strawberry jam so of course that was delicious.  My mother’s butter cream frosting?  Forgeddaboudit.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>  </p>
<p>Sure, they’re not shark cupcakes like <a href="http://store.discovery.com/dc-cupcakes-shark-week-dozen/detail.php?p=375803&amp;v=tlc_shows_dc-cupcakes&amp;ecid=SMM-DSC-00273&amp;pa=SMM-DSC-00273#mkcpgn=fbdsc1" target="_blank">THESE</a> are shark cupcakes, but mine were CONCEPT cupcakes!  I was all alone and I don’t know how to mold fondant!  What do you want from me?  </p>
<p>No, I will not share them!  </p>
<p>My private feeding frenzy ensues!</p>
<p>Happy Shark Week everybody!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a name="note1"></a>1. I am a recreational, not pro baker, so I had no idea how to bake myself just one fancy little cupcake like Kristen Wiig’s character does in <em>Bridesmaids</em>.  Besides, if I only made one cupcake how would I know if a second or third cupcake would be just as delicious?  Or the sixth or the twelfth??  I’m not a wizard!  Unless the cupcakes turn out awesome.  Then I’m a wizard!</p>
<p><a name="note2"></a>2. I am a wizard!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TV advertising and the insane amount of heart themed decorations at my local supermarché have notified me that Valentine&#8217;s Day has rolled around yet again. I’ve mentioned before <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/14/what-are-you-doing-for-valentines-day/">I don’t really care about this “holiday.”</a>  It might sound like I’m trying to be cool with the anti-Valentine&#8217;s Day attitude, but I seriously don’t think about it. Now, happily married (I’m really not trying to be a bitch about this if you’re Pro-V and single), Valentine&#8217;s Day just isn’t important. . . unless you’re going to go ALL OUT for it.</p>
<p>February of 1998 I celebrated Valentine&#8217;s Day with my high school boyfriend with the most clichéd date in the history of clichés.  We had a romantic (read: Italian) dinner at a local eatery, I was presented with flowers and a heart shaped box full of candy, and we went to the movies to see THE MOST craptastically romantic movie that ever wooed an entire generation of adolescent girls: <em>TITANIC</em></p>
<p>OH YEAH.</p>
<p>Cheesiest Valentines Day EVER. For me, anyway.  I was too young to get a marriage proposal from my true love on top of the Empire State Building after finding a ring in my champagne glass while a brass band played “All You Need is Love” with fireworks going off in the background and a fuck ton of white doves flying over our heads after an dinner where we shared a comically long spaghetti noodle while two Italian characitures serenaded us, so I settled for watching <em>Titanic</em>.  (This is what everyone was striving for in 1998, right?  I have no idea)</p>
<p>Anyway, this year I plan to top it.  Husband is in Moscow on this heartiest of days for a conference (it’s when the best miserable Russian weather is in season, really) and I’ll be home alone.</p>
<p>But, wait, I hear nobody say, how will you make Valentine&#8217;s Day cheesy with all sorts of love <em>sans</em> husband??</p>
<p>WITH EFFIN’ NACHOS, man!</p>
<p>A couple of dear friends and I are actively taking part in making Valentine&#8217;s Day cheesy  via <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html" target="_blank">a homemade cheese sauce</a> and watching anything and everything romantically ridiculous on Netflix and YouTube.  I’ll miss Husband, of course, but in his absence I really can’t think of anything more cheesy and beautiful than nachos and THUMBTANIC.*</p>

<p>Happy Valentines Day, everyone!  I hope <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiIsEgC3Wc" target="_blank">all your thumbs go on</a>!</p>
<p>*Disclaimer: I did not discover &#8220;Thumbtanic&#8221; by myself.  I happen to be friends with some awesomely wacky people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I like learning random things I often like to <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/home" target="_blank">Stumble</a> the internet.  Sometimes this activity leads me to see all sorts of wonderful things &#8212; brilliant photography, interesting TED talks, new recipes, pertinent news stories, things I’m happy to have seen.  Other times it just leads me to see some of the dumbest shit, because that’s how the Internet works.  I know this, and normally I just ignore it and go to the next thing, but this past weeks Stumble adventures have been more stupid than most.  Of course I couldn’t resist sharing it with all of you, because that’s the only way I know how to make my head stop hurting. </p>
<p><strong>1. Keep Yourself Cold and Thin</strong> </p>
<div style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Snuggie" src="https://i0.wp.com/i3.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/250/draft_lens8037351module68221721photo_1258026106KidSnuggie.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="182" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fat and lazy</p></div>
<p>I happened upon <a href="http://www.rd.com/slideshows/8-things-that-are-making-you-fat/4/" target="_blank">this tip</a> stating that I should turn down the thermostat and keep myself cold to shiver more often and burn calories. You know what I hate being? COLD. You know what helps keep me warm and happy? The layer of blubber I have so lovingly installed in my body via the consumption of insanely delicious servings of popcorn and bacon and pie (though not all at the same time… why have I not experimented with this?!?)  Why would I want to get rid of it? </p>
<p>Maybe for some people being cold makes them want to move about and stay active to keep warm, but not me.  Being cold just makes me want to get under all my warmest quilts and stay there until my chilly little nose stops running (which is one of the many reasons I will never be a mountain climber. I’d totally die up there snuggled in a crevice for a hypothermia nap). Of course, once I’m warm under my blankies I absolutely want to remain that way and will still not move.  So you know what?  No moving ever.  Room temperature could not help me lose weight, it could only exacerbate my idle tendencies.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know SCIENCE says, and technically YES, shivering burns calories but, seriously? Is my thermostat setting really what’s keeping me from fitting into my skinny jeans? Come on. ALSO, I can be in a cold room and feel uncomfortably cold long before I start shivering (thanks, bacon!), so. . . how cold are we talking here? Mountain top cold? Thanks, but eff that noise. </p>
<p><strong>2. Natural Snooki</strong> </p>
<div style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2088605/Snooki-makeup-Jersey-Shore-star-looks-unrecognisable.html"><img title="Snookie in the raw" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/uploads/images/article-images/1snooki_no_makeup_latino.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="217" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Snookie in the raw</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2088605/Snooki-makeup-Jersey-Shore-star-looks-unrecognisable.html" target="_blank">Snooki looks unrecognizable without makeup on!!</a></p>
<p>Seriously?  Some poor soul had to write this up as “news”? Consult the picture she posted on her Twitter account along with the tweet: “No make up day :) and IDC.” First of all, she is SO wearing eyeliner, which means at the LEAST she’s also got foundation on, so she can just take that “IDC” (I don’t care) shit and shove it, because she SO does.  How much time did she spend applying enough makeup to make it look like she’s not wearing any?</p>
<p>“Am I still pretty?  Do you all still know who I am?” This picture begs of its intended audience.   <br />
NO WE DON’T, AND WE DIDN’T MISS YOU.  Why?  Because you’re not ridiculous anymore, you’re just normal.  Normal and boring, just like us.  Which is clearly a crisis because, as Tracy Jordan says on <em>30 Rock</em>, “I can&#8217;t be normal. If I&#8217;m normal, I&#8217;m boring. If I&#8217;m boring, I&#8217;m not a movie star. If I&#8217;m not a movie star, I&#8217;m poor! And poor people can&#8217;t afford to pay back the $75,000 in cash they owe Quincy Jones!”</p>
<p><strong>3. Fur and Feathered Vaginas</strong></p>
<div style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2012/01/fur-and-feather-vaginal-decorating-explained.html/"><img title="Vagina decoration" src="https://i0.wp.com/cdn.blisstree.com/files/2012/01/0116-vigasil-sub-asset.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="255" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#039;d like the Don King, please</p></div>
<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2012/01/fur-and-feather-vaginal-decorating-explained.html/" target="_blank">Decorate your vagina with fur and feathers!</a> </p>
<p>WHO is doing this?</p>
<p>WHO is liking this?</p>
<p>When someone goes home with a woman and gets into her pants WHO is looking for pink fur?  Feathers?  What the hell!?  Doesn’t that get. . . MESSY?  DISGUSTING?  Isn’t that kind of discovery a deal breaker? It’s glued on. Don’t wonder what kind of glue they use, just know that it’s special.  Special glue for your special area.  My brain hurts.</p>
<p>I’m so glad an adorable fox was slain so women with too much money can get expensive procedures done to remove their pubic hair and replace it with animal fur that will remain adhered for all of four days.  That makes a whole lot of fucking sense.  Oh, wait, especially with the pun intended, NO IT DOESN’T.</p>
<p>And as long as we’re on the topic. . .</p>
<p><strong>4. Asian Women have Sideways Vaginas</strong> </p>
<p>Alright. . . I didn’t SEE this on the Internet.  This was mentioned in conversation and I’d never heard such a ridiculous myth before, so I started searching. I refused to believe that people could really be puzzled over something this insane. </p>
<p>Seriously. WHAT. THE SHIT. IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE? </p>
<p>I guess it’s my fault for looking.</p>

<p>For anyone unfamiliar with a Theremin it’s the wonderful machine that makes that cool flying saucer noise!  Used for the soundtracks of such classics as <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em>, <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Ed Wood</em>, and <em>Ghostbusters</em>, I can’t imagine why any film/television musical enthusiast wouldn’t want one.  I SURE AS HELL DO.  For an added Techie bonus, you can buy a kit and build your own!</td>

<p>Now that I’m all caught up on <em>Doctor Who</em> and re-obsessed with British television this is the perfect mug.  Though it is not bigger on the inside, the little lid of the TARDIS makes it awesome for tea steeping, if that’s your brewing style. This makes an awesome holiday gift especially if it’s received in time for use during the <em>Doctor Who Christmas Special</em>!</td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween is absolutely my favorite holiday.  Costumes, candy, and best of all, lots of terrific classic scary movies and Halloween specials! Back in the day Sister and I would come home from trick-or-treating to a warm house where we’d salivate in anticipation while our parents checked our candy.  We’d darken the living room and switch on the TV to watch glorious Halloween broadcasts without which it just wouldn’t have been Halloween.  Thanks to the magic of YouTube I’ve been able to re-watch my favorite specials as recently as this past Sunday.  I felt like a giddy little kid again, but as an adult I had some thoughts I’m very certain never crossed my tiny child mind.  Here are my favorite childhood specials and my adult reactions to them.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Halloween That Almost Wasn’t</strong></em></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHtzNeMsFek?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>The news in Transylvania is it’s not Halloween unless the Witch rides over the moon at midnight, but she doesn’t fucking want to!  Can Dracula, leader of the monsters and the rest of the gang change her mind before a two-thousand-year-old tradition is put to an end??</p>
<p>GASP!</p>
<p>For as long as we knew of it, and for as many years that it aired, Sister and I had a tradition of watching this special every year after trick-or-treating.  It was absolutely our favorite.  Dracula was chock full of wise cracks and Igor (as played by the late, great Henry Gibson) was the perfect bumbling sidekick (also, there’s a tap dancing Frankenstein!).  Once it was over Sister and I would eat our candy and role-play the show, taking turns switching parts, quoting lines and squeezing every last ounce of fun from the remainder of the night.</p>
<p>Adult reactions:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Some killjoy doesn’t fly over the moon and suddenly no more Halloween?  Psssht!  There will always be a Halloween as long as adults enable children to beg strangers for candy!  Nut up, Transylvania!</li>
<li>Also, WTF, Witch?  You were bitching about how you’re tired of being ugly, but in the final scene you transform into a gorgeous blonde!  Uhm, yeah, hi, did you not know you could perform magic on yourself before the disco party?  (Did I mention this special ends with a disco party?  YEAH.  It’s the best!  You’re welcome!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Garfield’s Halloween Adventure</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q2rngJ7RDU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>Garfield and Odie are trick-or-treating!  In pursuit of more candy they cross a river to find a creepy old house with a creepy old man inside who tells them ghost pirates are on their way!</p>
<p>I loved Garfield when I was a kid, and I would go out of my tiny mind with excitement watching this.  It’s lighthearted, but I was genuinely terrified of the ghosts who are onscreen for all of about 90 seconds.  The soundtrack does a lot to heighten the fear.  It’s a masterpiece, really.</p>
<p>Adult reaction:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Until shit gets real, Garfield’s got a snarky remark for almost everything, and I remember quoting lines from this cartoon all the time. This must have been how I developed the “humor as a defense mechanism” thing.</li>
<li>ALSO, still scared of the old man and the ghost pirates.  Seriously creeps me out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>It’s The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tIhwITwhSg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Charlie Brown is depressed as per usual (though I would be too if I kept getting rocks instead of candy), and Linus insists on waiting for The Great Pumpkin to rise up out of the pumpkin patch and bring toys to all the good little boys and girls (why have we never embraced this idea?!  It’s awesome!)</p>
<p>Sadly, it is not on YouTube in its entirety.  I happen to own the DVD.  My heart aches for you if you are without it.  Absolutely a classic!</p>
<p>Adult reaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching Lucy and Linus carving the jack-o-lantern was always my favorite part, along with Snoopy as the World War I Flying Ace.  Watching him roam the French countryside after his Sopwith Camel is shot down was always super eerie for me.</li>
<li>Also, someone call Lucy a bitch, please?  Just once?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Mr. Boogedy</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/61pIr7s_y_Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>A family moves into a spooky house haunted by the ghost of a mean pilgrim with a magic cloak straight from Satan’s wardrobe!  It’s a Disney Sunday Family movie starring John Astin (<em>The Addams Family</em>), Kristy Swanson (<em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>), a wee David Faustino (<em>Married with Children</em>), Katherine Kelly Lang (<em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em>), Benjamin Gregory  (<em>ALF</em>), and Richard Masur (or, as I know him, the guy whose head ends up in the library mini-fridge in <em>IT</em>).</p>
<p>Adult Reaction:  </p>
<ul>
<li>What they’ve got is a run of the mill poltergeist.  Call a priest.</li>
<li>The kids go to the local Historical Society to find out the history of the house.  John Astin tells them the tale via an old pop up book.  Seriously?  Someone made a pop-up book about a sadistic pilgrim?</li>
<li>Worst parents in the world.  The dad’s in the gag business and can’t take anything seriously, not even the genuine fears of his own children, and continues to antagonize them for cheap laughs.</li>
<li>Mr. Boogedy bewitches a vacuum cleaner to chase a kid and it ends up sucking up his own magic cloak, defeating him.  Again, can you not do magic?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disney Halloween Specials</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rYXp4kkaYSw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>These were compilations of anything that might have ever been spooky about Disney ever.  The Magic Mirror would host the segments concerning the classic scenes with the classic villains, which, let’s face it, are the highlight of most Disney movies.</p>
<p>Original shorts would be featured too.  My favorite being <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2muJDGdakCc" target="_blank">The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</a> as narrated by Bing Crosby (skip to 3:30 in Part 3 to get to the good stuff!).  We had this on vinyl too, but something about watching a flaming jack-o-lantern fly at the screen was the epitome of spooksville for me. If you want to listen to the LP, Vinyl Whores have posted it <a href="http://vinylwhores.blogspot.com/2011/10/very-vinyl-whores-halloween-legend-of.html" target="_blank">here</a> along with the videos.  I can’t tell if the popping on the LP audio is just the record, or if it’s supposed to sound like a crackling fire for effect.  Either way it induced quite a bit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Adult reaction:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Villainesses are BAD. ASS.  Maleficent, baby, I’m looking RIGHT. AT. YOU.</li>
<li>Donald Duck is an asshole of an Uncle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the Halloween specials I will always love.  What are yours?  Have I missed something awesome?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Novelty items are popular.  People can’t help buying silly, whimsical merchandise if they think the joke is hysterical or their love for geekery is strong enough.  I am no exception.  I used to own a <a href="http://phonevault.com/catalog/Novelty/FamousCharacters/kermitcs.asp">Kermit the Frog phone</a>.  If the items double as something moderately useful then so much the better! (I’m looking at you, <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/lights/df8c/">Sonic Screwdriver flashlight</a>)  And then there are items that, well, aren’t that great an idea.  They aren’t funny or even useful.  Sometimes they’re just the opposite.</p>
<p>First off: <strong>The gross stuff</strong></p>
<div style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Kitty litter cake" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.slipperybrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kitty-litter-cake.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="221" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Toxoplasmosis, anyone?</p></div>
<p>I’ll never understand pretending food and beverages are bodily waste.  I can go along with red beverage vampire jokes, but confections like <strong>Kitty Litter Cake</strong>  (I could rant about how much I hate the idea of this recipe, but. . . later) and the idea of a glass of fresh urine just aren’t funny to me.  I think it’s downright disturbing. Which is why I can’t conceive of anyone ever wanting or, for that matter, using a <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SQG4TU/?tag=047-20">toilet Bowl Coffee Mug</a></strong>. Who has this kind of, uhm, taste?  Is it really SO hilarious to pretend you’re drinking out of the toilet? The only possible reason I could see for owning this mug and using it for beverages is if you’re trying, in an excessively stupid way, to convey that in your opinion the office coffee is, uh, sub-par.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know where to start with the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Whizzer-Novelty-Liquor-Dispenser/dp/B000OKRP2C/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317771640&amp;sr=1-1">Little whizzer Drink Dispenser</a></strong>. It’s “inspired” by an <a href="http://images2.cafemomstatic.com/images/user/gallery/post_1490304_1260128516_med.jpg?imageId=17406720">actual fountain in Brussels</a>, but bottom line, it’s a figure of a urinating child.  If the figure were an adult it’d be an x-rated product.  Adults have the cash flow to be buying this “little man piss” drink dispenser, so the implications of that are pretty bad.</p>
<p>Second: <strong>The stupid stuff</strong></p>
<p>I’m not against low-brow humor.  Bad puns, “that’s what she said,&#8221; and innuendos (heh, heh, in-your-end-o, heh, heh) are not beyond me.  I won’t swear I’ve never laughed at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMvW-_pkX3Q&amp;feature=related">a fart joke</a>, it’s just that I don’t usually, especially if my olfactory sense is being assaulted.   Which is why I find the following products appalling:</p>
<div style="width: 288px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Fire fart" src="https://i2.wp.com/ecdn1.hark.com/images/000/000/628/628/original.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="193" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh, grow up</p></div>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Assets-Novelties-LLC-Mister/dp/B000OCEWGW/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317768639&amp;sr=8-31">Liquid Ass Fart Spray</a></strong> is described as a stink spray, something that sounds like an evil villain mastermind should be in charge of it. More than likely though, it’ll be wielded by that asshole from accounts who thinks farts are the end all be all of hilarity.  Either way, it has to be let off by the buyer somehow.  For $4.25 why not just indulge in a sub-par burrito? Or as one might call it, “Ass Classic”?</p>
<p>Also from the famous (really? Famous? Has ANYONE EVER heard of this?) makers of Liquid Ass:</p>
<p>BARFume – smells like barf!  Get it?!</p>
<p>Tex-Ass – smells like BBQ at first, and THEN ass! *eye roll*</p>
<p>The only possible practical use for these stink sprays would be to spray it around the Toilet Bowl Coffee Mug to teach that unfunny bastard we do NOT drink out of the toilet.</p>
<p>Thirdly: <strong>The dangerous stuff</strong></p>
<p>As far as multi-use elements go, water is tops in my book.  Yes, there’s a lot to do with good old H2O.  Bathing, swimming, relaxing, walking and flying… wait, what?  Walking and flying?  That’s not what water’s for!  Well, maybe with the right technology, which does not describe the next two items on our list:</p>
<div style="width: 312px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="The Flaming Lips in a ball!" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.nola.com/voodoofest_impact/photo/web-lipsjpg-3d94d13f206cb790_large.jpg" alt="" width="302" height="188" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wayne Coyne has one! You should too!</p></div>
<p>One of the two reviews of the <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZMN8IU/?tag=047-20">Water Ball</a></strong> explains a distinct lack of basic instructions and safety precautions for this human hamster ball.  Somehow you’re supposed to put someone inside this giant plastic ball, inflate it and then toss it on water.  Oxygen is limited.  It can’t be opened from the inside.  How would you exit it without the dastardly laws of physics taking over if a suitable shoreline was unavailable?  How can you even control the damn thing once you’re in it?  I can’t believe this inflatable deathtrap is on the market.</p>
<p>If you’ve got about $100,000 lying around and have a James Bond fantasy, but are afraid of fire, then perhaps what you need is the <strong><a href="http://www.jetlev-flyer.com/en/62868-Where-to-buy">water jetpack</a></strong>.  You may recognize it from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRVspuAJyAY&amp;NR=1">schadenfreude/fail</a>. That video should  be enough to put enough fear of humiliation into a person to avoid this contraption like a room that’s been infiltrated by Liquid Ass.  It seems like an awful high price tag and a lot of unnecessary danger for very little pay off.  On the other hand, I’m a huge fan of The Darwin Awards, so you know what?  I take it back.  Buy a jet pack and a water ball.  Play with the damn things on the ocean.  I look forward to reading the hilarious events of your death.</p>
<p>Lastly: <strong>The incredibly offensive stuff</strong></p>
<p>Here we have merchandise that is just downright inappropriate.  There are some things regarding which enough time has not passed for a joke to be regarded as anything but in bad taste.  Especially when innocent people died for said joke.  Behold:</p>
<div style="width: 262px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="  " title="Gin and Titonic" src="https://i2.wp.com/j.b5z.net/i/u/2075403/i/ginandtitonic_648.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="252" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Seriously, a lot of people died. I need a drink.</p></div>
<p>I know it’s been almost one hundred years since the Titanic sank, and I’m all for puns, but the<strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P8XE5W/?tag=047-20">Gin and Titonic</a></strong> could really ruin a drink for me.  Over 1500 men, women and children drowned and/or froze to death when Titanic sank due to an iceberg (and multiple design flaws).  I don’t think the victims or the survivors and their descendants would appreciate the irony of tiny iceberg and Titanic ice molds. If you think I’m taking this too seriously and should lighten up then please remember not to get all bent out of shape when someone thinks Challenger and World Trade Center inspired fireworks are a hilarious idea.</p>
<p>So the next time you’ve got money to burn and want to make a hilarious purchase to add some whimsy to your life and crack up your friends, maybe restrict yourself to a <strong><a href="http://beardbeanie.com/">beard beanie</a></strong> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kotobukiya-Star-Wars-Carbonite-Silicon/dp/B004R7S9I2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1317778881&amp;sr=8-1">Han Solo ice molds</a>. In a worst-case scenario everyone will just think of you as a dork instead of gross, stupid or an asshole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My recreational research of animals and overactive imagination means I often entertain the idea of the possibility of movie monsters being real things.  For me this is my normal thought process and I don’t understand why everyone else isn’t more scared of this shit.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQNztpOnDw">Glow-in-the-dark cat clones are part of our world</a>, what’s so off-the-wall about thinking movie monsters could really happen?  Also, sometimes nature doesn’t need a whole lot of embellishment to be terrifying.   The abominations of the silver screen and their existence in the natural world can be easily linked with a little crazy creativity, and I’ve made a LIST.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alien</em> &amp; the Giant Isopod</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7326" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/969104893_0c5c546408/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg" data-orig-size="375,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="969104893_0c5c546408" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=375" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7326" title="969104893_0c5c546408" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="giant isopod" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300 225w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=113&amp;h=150 113w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>The giant isopod is like an aquatic woodlouse (roly poly) only, you know, bigger.  They can survive for eight weeks without food, but when these carnivorous scavengers scuttle over an abundant food source they’ll consume until they’re immobile</p>
<p>They don’t seem like much of a threat based on their fairly normal crustacean lifestyle, but I wouldn’t fall for that, “If your giant isopod is bigger than your face you have cancer” bullshit and put the crustacean up to your head. That’s what it WANTS you to do so it can gorge on your insides.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arachnophobia</em> &amp; the Cyclocosmia Spider</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7331" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/spider-cut/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg" data-orig-size="500,362" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="spider cut" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7331" title="spider cut" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=300&#038;h=217" alt="cyclocosmia spider" width="300" height="217" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=300&amp;h=217 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=150&amp;h=109 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Seeing <em>Arachnophobia</em> as a child mainly scared me on account of how hard it was to kill the spider at the end.  That damn thing was the Rasputin of arachnids.  But stomp on something hard enough and it will stop living, right?</p>
<p>Probably not the Cyclocosmia spider.</p>
<p>It looks like it has a boot print on its ass from getting stomped on and NOT DYING. Science explains the weird truncated abdomen is its protection.  The hardened disc serving as a plug for the spiders borrow to keep unwanted visitors out and a means of camouflage.</p>
<p>Shut up, science! Spider voodoo surely keeps it alive!</p>
<p><strong><em>The Blob</em> &amp; the Sea Pig</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7334" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/sea-pig-4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg" data-orig-size="550,412" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sea-pig-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=550" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7334" title="sea-pig-4" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="Sea pig" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=224 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=112 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Even Steve McQueen ran his bad ass away from <em>The Blob</em>, the gelatinous amorphous creature that fell from the sky.  To find nature’s blob hopeful look not up, but down.</p>
<p>The sea pig lives at great depths on the ominously named abyssal plain in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans.  Kinda cute as members of the sea cucumber family go, but like many kinds of sea cucumber, sea pigs are often found in huge numbers.  A gigantic mass of pink squishy things, you say?  Like. . . a BLOB?</p>
<p>It’s still too early to tell the extent of the damage from the BP oil spill.  It could some-crazy-how cause sea pigs to fuse together to form a carnivorous pink glob.  An angry glob.</p>
<p><strong><em>Evil Dead 2</em> &amp; the Chinese Water Deer</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7345" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/chinese-deer/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chinese-deer" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7345" title="chinese-deer" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Chinese water deer" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><em>Evil Dead 2</em>, while gloriously campy, does genuinely frighten me a bit.  Aside from the stab of panic I feel over the threat of ankle-grabbing cellar dwellers, there’s this possessed deer head. I used to live in far less fear with the knowledge that creepy deer with pointy teeth are not a thing, but then. . .</p>
<p>Instead of antlers Chinese water deer have what are technically classified as tusks, or, in murderous murdering terms, FANGS. Fangs the deer can actually MOVE. They can be drawn back out of the way while eating, or thrust forward to use in combat.  Like you do if you’re an evil deer.</p>
<p>In fact, according to Wikipedia, “Recently, the &#8216;vampire deer have made headlines in Southern Tennessee because &#8216;Aimee,&#8217; a small female, had escaped from a Marietta, Mississipp farm and displayed aggressive behavior towards visitors on the Natchez Trace Parkway.”</p>
<p>Wait. Tennessee?  Where <em>Evil Dead</em> was filmed?  Oh, HELL.</p>
<p><strong><em>Night of the Lepus</em> &amp; the Flemish Giant Rabbits</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve never seen this science fiction (ahem) * thriller * about <a title="Night of the lepus" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xulXFB3-A3c">carnivorous mutated rabbits</a> then you have wasted less of your life than I.  I thought the concept giant rabbits was a load of bullocks. And then I discovered these gigantic bunnies.</p>
<p>My first thought was literally, “OH, SHIT.  GIANT RABBITS.”  For though <em>Night of the Lepus</em> is ridiculous, the idea of a rabbit ripping your throat out is actually terrifying because, let’s face it, bunnies are supposed to be non-threatening.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcxKIJTb3Hg">Monty Python really knew what they were talking about</a>. The Flemish Giant Rabbits were bred large on purpose based on the notion that large rabbits equals lots more rabbit meat.  If <em>Jurassic Park</em> has taught us anything, it’s that if man manipulates nature, nature is bound to rip man’s throat open with it’s adorably oversized teeth.</p>

<p id="internal-source-marker_0.5833292347100938" dir="ltr">
<p>Pokemon are weird bastard animals trained to battle other weird bastard animals with their magic to become more powerful, or whatever. It’s a little scary if you think about it (battles aren’t to the death, because, you know, the children.  But if it weren’t for the children you know these things would be slaughtering the shit out of each other).</p>
<p>I realize a Pokemon Lightning Dragon isn’t a movie monster, but, seriously, look at this sea slug and tell me your first thought wasn’t, “It looks like a Pokemon!”</p>
<p>The Nudibranchs thrive and reach their largest sizes in warm, shallow waters (where most humans like to swim).  If those waters were ever contaminated with whatever nuclear waste cocktail made Godzilla, well, you can see we&#8217;d have a problem.</p>
<p>Having shed their shells at the larval stage, Nudibrachs developed other means of defense.  Some types of Nudibranch prey on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Man_O%27_War">Portuguese Man O’ War</a>, which is slightly terrifying on its own.  Nudibranchs don’t kill the Man O’ War, they just eat off its most potent nematocysts (stinging cells) and rather than digest them, the slug passes them from its gut to the surface of its skin to use for protection.  Explain it with as much science as you want, it seems like gaining experience points and leveling up to me.  It’s just a matter of time before a slew of Nudibranchs mutates and start collecting us all.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zombies! </em>&amp; The Greenland shark</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Greenland Shark" src="https://i1.wp.com/2009oceans5.wikispaces.com/file/view/greenlandShark.jpg/114501201/greenlandShark.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="259" /></p>
<p>My first thought when I look at this shark?  Zombie.</p>
<p>If there were to be zombie fish, or a fish responsible for a zombie outbreak the Greenland shark would be the cause of it.  It lives in very deep, very cold water and it moves very slowly, much like the undead. Its lifespan is speculated to be 200 years (it’s 200 years old because it’s a damned ZOMBIE).  The perfectly logical explanation for the undead look of the eyes is a parasite called a Copepod that burrows into the shark’s cornea.</p>
<p>I don’t care what’s causing it.  It looks FUCKING. CREEPY.</p>
<p>Also, Greenland shark meat, considered a delicacy in Greenland and Iceland, is straight up toxic.  To prepare it you have to boil the hell out of it or bury it in the ground and let it freeze and thaw several times in order to ferment it.  Without this preparation consuming fresh, untreated Greenland shark meat may cause effects similar to “extreme drunkenness.”</p>
<p>You know what else resembles extreme drunkenness?</p>
<p>THE WALKING DEAD.</p>
<p>I’m not completely convinced that Greenland sharks are NOT Great White zombies.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had gorgeous weather in my new neighborhood this past weekend, though I hardly got to enjoy any of it on account of being knocked on my arse by my own traitorous sinuses. With sickness comes a lot of time spent languishing under warm blankets and snuggling into fluffy pillows while I wish away my sore throat and the onslaught of mucous hordes. Husband was out of town (he felt icky before I did and I forced him to take ALL the cold medicine with him since he’d need it more than me) and I had no one to keep me company except for our two cats and The Doctor.</p>
<p>Doctor Who?</p>
<p>Yes. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw" target="new">That’s the one.</a></p>
<p>Some friends of mine are dead mad over this British Sci Fi program <em>Doctor Who</em>. I had never really watched it, but they kept telling me I’d love it. I was all alone in a strange neighborhood in a strange state with no agenda to speak of and mix in the thickening agent of feeling ill AND homesick on top of it. With the help of Netflix I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>Turns out, there’s always something about a fast-talking, wickedly smart, funny English bloke I can’t help but adore (*waves girlishly at Simon Pegg*). The Doctor is an alien in human form and he is a Time Lord, the last of his kind. He travels through time and space in his blue Police Box called the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) with his (usually female) companions. He helps the races of the universe sort out their messes. He really just wants everybody and everything to get along, but woe to those beings set on conquest and destruction (I’m looking at you, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek" target="new">Daleks</a>, you jerk asses).</p>
<p>The episodes are fairly formulaic, but in that comforting way your childhood shows were: Episode begins normal (as normal as a show about space and time travel throughout the entire universe can) there’s some sort of mystery to be solved, problems arise, ensue and are overcome always in the nick of time (unless it’s a two parter).</p>
<p>I’ve found Doctor Who extremely medicinal while I’m ill and homesick (see what I’ve done there?). British TV series have always been my favorites since I was a child. I grew up watching things like <em>Fawlty Towers</em> and the BBC miniseries of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>. Douglas Adams’ glorious tales of space travel, wacky characters and alien life forms always held my attention. Through <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide</em>, and those two weeks I spent every February battling strep throat, I developed television-viewing stamina and have since become a damn champion of TV series consumption.</p>
<p>This weekend was spent watching more <em>Doctor Who</em> than I care to admit, but to give you an idea, Husband could tell as soon as he got home just from the way I was talking (Oi, whats ‘e on about?). <em>Doctor Who</em> has so many aliens, monsters, wacky characters, plot twists and cliff hangers that if you miss a single episode you’ll miss someone or something awesome, so there is no choice but to watch ALL of them. Apart from that the acting is so strong and breathtaking at times that I will openly admit to weeping like a baby during the more heart wrenching moments. Aliens and destruction of the universe aside, that is what has kept me so strongly invested in the show. The characters are lovable and strong, quirky and human (er, some of them, sort of), vulnerable and consistent except for, you know, all the different people who have played the Doctor.</p>

Bow ties are cool.</p></div>
<p>As an alien The Doctor is able to regenerate new bodies when he has need of them like, say, when his current body is dying (aka the lead actor is stepping out). This is how there have been eleven Doctors. The show first aired in 1963 and ran until 1989 when it was suspended. The BBC brought the series back in 2005 with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001172/" target="_blank">Christopher Eccleston</a> as the Ninth Doctor for a new Season (Series) 1. I must say, that while Eccleston is an exceptional actor, but he’s got nothing on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855039/" target="_blank">David Tennant</a> (Ten) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1741002/" target="_blank">Matt Smith</a>(Eleven) as the Doctor. Tennant and Smith are delightful, terrifying, endearing, brilliant and heartbreaking as the last of the Time Lords.</p>
<p>The music is worth mentioning too. There are T.V. sound tracks, and there is melodic fried Gold. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/murray-gold/id205582333" target="_blank">Murray Gold</a> is responsible for fantastic scores throughout the episodes, which gives them a cinematic quality like no other television show I’ve ever watched. I’ve got quite a collection of songs and soundtracks from my favorite films and shows, and the <em>Doctor Who</em> scores are soon to be among them. This gorgeous, intense, and tender music is expertly woven into the story lines.</p>
<p>Though I’m several states away from my hometown The Doctor and his friends have made me feel at ease in my new abode while they traveled to different times and unseen corners of the universe. Doctor Who is awesome. And British. And readily available on Netflix. Just the dose of comforting BBC television I needed to put me right. I may be a little late to the <em>Doctor Who</em> TARDIS party, but I’m definitely onboard.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[1. What was your first column? My first column was &#8220;Batman, a memoir in media.&#8221; Kevin Mattison had been inviting and nudging me to write a piece for The Idler for a while (dude has faith in me) and my brain box just wasn’t feeling a good vibe with anything I would come up with.&#160;&#8230; <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/30/thoughtcicles-year-one/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. What was your first column?</strong></p>
<p>My first column was <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/01/batman-a-memoir/">&#8220;Batman, a memoir in media.&#8221;</a> Kevin Mattison had been inviting and nudging me to write a piece for <em>The Idler</em> for a while (dude has faith in me) and my brain box just wasn’t feeling a good vibe with anything I would come up with.  Everything felt forced and non-genuine.  But then I was told it was Batman Week, and I suddenly knew what I wanted to write about.  As it turns out, when writing about something I love it comes quite naturally.  My Thoughtcicles are not the best things ever written, but they are heartfelt and I’m proud of that.</p>
<p><strong>2. What is your favorite <em>Idler</em> column that you didn&#8217;t write?</strong></p>
<p>Jill Kolongowski’s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/07/18/on-the-hogwarts-express-pumpkin-pasties/">&#8220;On the Hogwarts Express: Pumpkin Pasties&#8221;</a> is definitely up there on my list of favorites.  As a lover of food, &#8220;The F Word&#8221; is always a highlight of my internet reading.  I am also often struck with wistful waves of nostalgia and long for times past on a daily basis.  Settling in for a <em>Harry Potter</em> marathon with delicious comfort food as a means of building up to the final movie and saying goodbye to your childhood?  All I can say is I wish I had been there. Just thinking of what fun we might have had together gets me all misty-eyed. . .</p>
<p><strong>3. What sort of things do you want to write about in the next year?</strong></p>
<p>Since the words only flow forth when I’m passionate about the topic: I have no idea.  My head is an unending sea of eclectic humors and thoughts, many of which get forgotten about and then resurface unexpectedly.  One thing I can promise: Something featuring Bruce Campbell and/or Eddie Izzard whenever my heart and my head are in the same place.  Love those guys.</p>

<p>If you’ve been reading, you know <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/01/batman-a-memoir/">how much I love Batman</a>, so sharks are kind of a big deal.  </p>
<p>My fascination with these awesome predators was peaked as a young child with the movie, <em>Jaws</em>.  I hadn’t seen it, but a neighborhood playmate had and she always made us play it.  I don’t know if I even had a good idea of what a shark looked like, I was that young.  All I knew was the ladder laid across the lawn was safe, and if even so much as a toe touched the grass I would die.  It was a seriously scary game.</p>
<p>A few years later my mother finally gave me permission to see <em>Jaws</em> and after that I was officially hooked (unintentional fishing pun. . . maybe).  Could something that huge and awesome and petrifying really exist?  If I touched my toe to the ocean would I be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzv-c6d_Zzs" target="_blank">bitten in half like Quint</a>? For a while, that was my biggest fear, being bitten in half.  I, like so many others, was terrified of sharks because of <em>Jaws</em>, but somehow fascinated by them nonetheless.</p>
<p>When I was eleven I was introduced to the magic of Shark Week while staying at my grandmother’s house during a heat wave.  Mimi had central air and cable, so life was pretty sweet.  Every night my eyes would be glued to the shark documentaries.  I began to learn about what I feared and the fear became a heartfelt appreciation for an animal designed for predatory perfection.</p>
<p>For years after that I made a point to never miss Shark Week.  I was no longer terrified of being bitten in half (I mean, yeah it wouldn’t be pleasant, and I’d really rather not, but hey, if it happens, it happens) but the idea of not watching Shark Week filled me with that same kind of anguish.  I vowed never to miss it.</p>
<p>And then we cancelled cable.</p>
<p>Husband and I rationalized that cable is a &#8220;want,&#8221; not a need. </p>
<p>On the other hand, for me, Shark Week is a NEED.  Knowing this, Husband gave me the 20th Anniversary Collection of Shark Week on DVD, thusly securing his place in my heart forever while proving himself an excellent provider.</p>
<p>But I still long for the new and exciting Shark Week episodes every summer. . . what’s a lady to do?</p>
<p>INTERNET TO THE RESCUE!</p>
<p>For the glory of gnashing teeth and supreme excellence I present for you my Lack of Televised Shark Week Survival Kit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of course, <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/shark-week/" target="_blank">the Shark Week homepage</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/top-10-shark-jumping-videos/" target="_blank">Sharks jumping!</a> (If this is not some of the most amazing footage you’ve ever seen we can’t be friends.  You must understand:  Sharks are ultimately the coolest.)</li>
<li><a href="http://fuckyeahsharks.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Fuck Yeah Sharks!</a> Not always classy, but still all kinds of awesome.  For instance <a href="http://fuckyeahsharks.tumblr.com/post/230858634/more-of-the-shark-attack-victim-costume-from-erin" rel="nofollow">http://fuckyeahsharks.tumblr.com/post/230858634/more-of-the-shark-attack-victim-costume-from-erin</a> .</li>
</ul>
<p>Salvation also lies with YouTube, where you can watch clips from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?annotation_id=annotation_885904&amp;p=84AC62E942084834&amp;feature=iv" target="_blank">Shark Weeks of yore</a> until your very eyes roll over white with visual feeding frenzied joy.*  </p>
<p>Here you can find: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWEdStaaZyE" target="_blank">Shark Hypnosis!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tG5NX7fC8VM&amp;feature=relmfu" target="_blank">Do sharks have a color preference?</a>  An important question, to be sure. </li>
</ul>
<p>BBC Worldwide also has a nice variety of shark-tastic videos, but they’re not all teeth and blood.  Take this clip about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdCI9w3LLoQ&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">the basking shark</a>. And, while I’m not crazy about the narration, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usoMaksp7Qc&amp;NR=1" target="_blank">this clip about Megladon</a> blows my mind. (Thanks, Britain!)</p>
<p>And if you STILL don’t think Sharks rock, then check it:  <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2011/06/08/137059984/5-songs-for-sharks-that-like-ac-dc?sc=fb&amp;cc=fp" target="_blank">Confirmation by NPR</a>. </p>
<p>We must all strive to live every week like it’s Shark Week.  Thanks to the Internet my summer is complete again. </p>
<p>*Warning: Evil still lurks on the YouTubes and you may, trying to satisfy your craving for more incredible shark footage, be tempted to click on videos with titles like, “Man gets too close to a great white shark and it attacks him.”  Do not click on it.  You will be Rick Rolled.</p>
