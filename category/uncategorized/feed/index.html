										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The worst part of being an addict is the lack of a fix.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an NHL addict. I read NHL blogs, listen to NHL podcasts, follow NHL writers and players on Twitter, and even had a brief writing gig for a hockey blog (a weekly column about fantasy hockey). Heck, I even had a weekly talk show about the NHL during my tenure as a college radio host. Hockey has been a subject of <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/06/11/being-an-nhl-fan-in-lansing/" target="_blank">a few</a> of my comic strips on <a title="comics and such" href="http://clattertron.com" target="_blank">Clattertron</a>, and will be featured in more to come.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10595" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/26/here-we-go-again-another-nhl-lockout/igeekhockey/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,464" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Igeekhockey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=194" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10595" title="Igeekhockey" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=640" alt="I geek hockey" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=97 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=194 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"   /> To further beat a dead horse, when I was asked to be a part of the Capital Area District Libraries&#8217; Geek the Library campaign, my fliers and such proudly proclaimed, “I Geek Hockey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suffice to say, the current NHL Lockout, the third of Commissioner Gary Bettman&#8217;s career, is a blockade around my supply. I&#8217;m an addict without a fix.</p>
<p>And I hate every second. Hate is a strong word, and I try not to over use it, but it applies here. I hate the lockout.</p>
<p>I am still bitter about the loss of the 2004-2005 season due to the previous lockout. Several players I grew up watching missed a chance for one more season. It also meant a year without my favorite few months &#8212; The Stanley Cup Playoffs. No battles against rivals, no stories about a team chasing a cup, no chance of a team finally winning its first Cup or ending a decades long drought. For the first time since 1919, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004–05_NHL_lockout" target="_blank">no Stanley Cup was awarded</a>.</p>
<p>But, like an old girlfriend I can&#8217;t walk away from, I took the NHL back with open arms when it returned. I&#8217;m an addict after all. What was I going to do, start following football?</p>
<p>Not likely. I can&#8217;t stand football, basketball, or baseball. Anything with the &#8220;ball&#8221; suffix is right out &#8212; with the exception of Whirlyball.</p>
<p>First things first: <strong>this is not a strike</strong>. This is a <strong>lockout</strong>.</p>
<p>A strike is when the players refuse to play. That is not the case here. The players were locked out (not able to legally play) by the owners because their collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired, and a new CBA has not been agreed upon.</p>
<p>The previous CBA gave the NHL the salary cap, for better or worse (which is worthy of its own article). And with the salary cap came the insane cap circumventing contracts with a length of ten years or more (the final years of these long contracts have players earning about a million a year, with some contracts lasting until a player was 40 or older &#8212; this brings the yearly cap hit down). Most players are lucky to make it to 40, let alone 42 or 43 when a few notable contracts expire). The New Jersey Devils were penalized when the league deemed their 17-year, $102 million(!) contract with Ilya Kovalchuk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Kovalchuk#New_Jersey_Devils" target="_blank">circumvented the salary cap</a>. He was eventually signed for 15-years and $100 million.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the many, many issues behind this lockout. I recommend checking out the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/marek-vs.-wyshynski/id480511229" target="_blank">Marek versus Wyshynski podcast</a>, because they explain the issues better than I ever could. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/september-17th-edition-marek/id480511229?i=120813352" target="_blank">A recent episode</a> had an interview with NHLPA member (and retired player) Mathieu Schneider.</p>
<p>What this lockout will bring, I cannot say. When it will end is anyone&#8217;s guess. If, IF, this season is saved, I have heard the magic date of late November. This would mean the NHL&#8217;s biggest cash cow, the Winter Classic, would still happen.</p>
<p>As much as I want to see, or attend, an outdoor game featuring the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs (at the University of Michigan&#8217;s Big House no less), I am not optimistic it will happen.</p>
<p>Both sides seem far apart in this lockout, and I have read anecdotal comments from players expecting this lockout to, once again, last all season. NHL players have been heading off to play in Europe this week (most notably, Russia&#8217;s KHL), which hints this lockout could last a while.</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Those really hurt by this lockout are the support staff &#8212; the folks who work at the arena. There have been a slew of layoffs around the NHL already, and there are likely more to come.</p>
<p>Please, don&#8217;t let there be another lost season. One game missed it too many. I need my fix. And I don&#8217;t want to resort to fantasy baseball again, like I did last time (I had no idea what I was doing, which the same scenario when I attend a baseball game in person &#8212; I&#8217;m lost, except for the drinking beer outside part. I have that covered).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the NCAA Division I Men&#8217;s Basketball Tournament, commonly known as March Madness.<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> As a 64-team [*ahem* 68, but who&#8217;s counting?] single-elimination tournament spread out over roughly three weeks, there&#8217;s simply nothing else like it in college or professional sports. The first and second rounds<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a> alone consist of forty-eight games in four days, reducing the tournament field from 64 to the sweet sixteen. It&#8217;s a glorious orgy of athletic competition.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time, I found myself with the free time to (theoretically) watch the entire first round, and in all honesty, I was just a bit disappointed with the experience. You may suggest that I might have felt differently had I shelled out the $4 to be able to watch all the games online instead of being limited to what was airing on CBS (I don&#8217;t have cable), or had I been watching the games with a group instead of by myself, but I say that you&#8217;re underthinking things, and in the spirit of public improvement, I offer a few suggestions on how the single greatest competition in major American sports can be made even more exciting.</p>
<p><strong>1. More elimination</strong></p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_9251" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9251" data-attachment-id="9251" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/22/snark-madness/marchcrying/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/marchcrying.jpg" data-orig-size="606,403" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="marchcrying" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/marchcrying.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/marchcrying.jpg?w=606" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/marchcrying.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="crying" title="marchcrying" width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-9251" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/marchcrying.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/marchcrying.jpg?w=598&amp;h=398 598w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/marchcrying.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9251" class="wp-caption-text">Where else do you get to see so many grown men crying?</p></div> The best part of the tournament right now is its one-and-done setup. No dragging things out with a best of five or best of seven series. Win or go home. It doesn&#8217;t matter how good of a season you&#8217;ve had, once March Madness begins, all that matters is the score at the end of the second half.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be even more exciting if the field didn&#8217;t just get smaller ever round, but the game itself got smaller? You could start with full-court games in the first round, and then half-court games in the second. The sweet sixteen would be 3-on-3, and the elite eight 1-on-1. The final four would be two games of H-O-R-S-E, and the national championship would be a slam dunk contest. Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>2. More surprises</strong></p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_9252" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9252" data-attachment-id="9252" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/22/snark-madness/kyle-oquinn-n24/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/1331939821_ff3b.jpg" data-orig-size="973,768" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;AP&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Norfolk State&#039;s Kyle O&#039;Quinn (10) and Brandon Wheeless, right, celebrate after defeating Missouri 86-84 in an NCAA tournament second-round college basketball game at CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Neb., Friday, March 16, 2012.

You still don't remember their name. But they killed your bracket.</p></div> Other than cheering for one&#8217;s alma mater, the most exciting games are the upsets, am I right? 15-seed Lehigh defeating 2-seed Duke. Fellow #2 seed, the mighty Mizzou, predicted by many in the know to play in the final four, eliminated by, um, The Team that Beat Mizzou. Bigger numbers beating smaller numbers! Big schools losing to small schools! Teams you know and hate losing to schools you&#8217;ve never heard of and won&#8217;t remember in April!</p>
<p>Even so, the South and West divisions still find their #1, 3, and 4 seeds playing in the sweet sixteen, and the East has its #1, 2, and 4 seeds still alive. Eleven of the sixteen teams playing in the third round are exactly who should still be playing based on the initial seeding. Having five upstarts is great, but we can do better.</p>
<p>How? With a secret extra play-in round where 32 teams play for the right to face the sweet sixteen in surprise matchups! Lehigh may have beaten Duke, but can they beat, um, Oakland University? Perennial power North Carolina paired up against the University of Chicago!<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Total madness</strong></p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_9254" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9254" data-attachment-id="9254" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/22/snark-madness/piper21/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/piper21.jpg" data-orig-size="456,352" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="piper21" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/piper21.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/piper21.jpg?w=456" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/piper21.jpg?w=300&#038;h=231" alt="Rowdy Roddy Piper" title="piper21" width="300" height="231" class="size-medium wp-image-9254" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/piper21.jpg?w=300&amp;h=231 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/piper21.jpg?w=150&amp;h=116 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/piper21.jpg 456w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-9254" class="wp-caption-text">People, we can make this happen.</p></div> Sick of Charles Barkley in the booth? Put the man on the floor! Each team gets 5 minutes of play each game from randomly-assigned retired professionals. Play-in rounds not to bring new teams into the tournament, but where teams play for the right to use five alumni from a previous national champion team during one tournament game. In the first round, refs aren&#8217;t allowed to blow their whistles during the last two minutes of each half. In the second round, refs are required to blow their whistles every fifteen seconds during the last two minutes of each half. In the third round, Rowdy Roddy Piper refs EVERY GAME.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m telling you, people, we are limited only by our imaginations.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a name="note1"></a>1. Registered trademark of the NCAA</p>
<p><a name="note2"></a>2. Even though the NCAA officially expanded the play-in game(s) from two teams to sixteen this year, and relabeled those games &#8220;the first round,&#8221; I refuse to acknowledge such a travesty until a single play-in team wins a single game in the actual tournament. Then I&#8217;ll think about it.</p>
<p><a name="note3"></a>3. The University of Chicago doesn&#8217;t have a basketball team, you say? That&#8217;s what makes it a surprise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If spending the past two years living in an expensive city has taught me anything, it’s that asking for things you want for the holidays only makes sense if you’re willing to buy yourself all the practical things you need (which I’m not). And also, that rats can be the size of small children.</p>
<p>Because no one asked, even though my birthday falls in December and is therefore an official part of the holiday season,  I’m supplying a list I hope my family sees of the awesome-est of the practical things I am unwilling to spend my money on because I’m saving up for fancy shoes, a puppy, and an iPad. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week marks the full-scale beginning of DC&#8217;s Universe-wide reboot, but before we hit the reset button on every superhero&#8217;s origins and adventures, it&#8217;s worth acknowledging the end of one of the longest running comic series in history: <em>Action Comics</em> Volume 1.</p>

Copies have sold for as much as a million dollars, and the cover is arguably the most well-known comic art in history. </p>
<p>Now, over 70 years and 900 issues later, the first volume of <em>Action Comics</em> has come to end with issue #904. Unfortunately, the story that ends the series is not the story fans deserved, and I can&#8217;t help be a bit disappointed with DC&#8217;s closure to a major era.</p>
<p><strong>**Warning: Major Spoilers Follow**</strong></p>
<p>After nearly a year of being absent from the pages of <em>Action Comics</em>, Superman made his dramatic return to the series in the landmark issue #900.  His nemesis, Lex Luthor, had been center stage for the previous year as he sought out the god-like power of a Black Lantern ring. After finally achieving his goal, Luther and Superman collide in outer space in what could accurately be described as the ultimate showdown. Ultimately, Luthor&#8217;s arrogance and myopic hatred for the man of steel causes his own downfall, but their battle is only the half-way point of the final story.</p>
<p>Action #900 was actually issue 6 in a 10-issue crossover series entitled “The Reign of the Doomsdays.” The title itself is a throwback to the epic 1993 storyline “The Reign of the Supermen.” Following his death battling Doomsday, four characters &#8212; Steel, Superboy, The Eradicator, and the Cyborg Superman &#8212; laid claim to Superman&#8217;s legacy until the man himself returned months later. </p>
<p>Death is almost always temporary in the world of comics, so not surprisingly Doomsday returned from the dead as well and has had several “rematches” with Superman in the two decades since they originally met. But &#8220;The Reign of the Doomsdays&#8221; was different in that it featured and focused on the same characters as the original “Reign” storyline.  Starting in a <em>Steel</em> one-shot and continuing in issues of <em>Outsiders</em>, <em>Justice League of America</em>, a <em>Superman/Batman</em> Annual and <em>Superboy</em>, the plots centers on Doomsday hunting down and battling the four characters who appeared during Superman&#8217;s absence in the 1990s.  Things were noticeably different almost immediately, however, when Doomsday displayed different powers and objectives than he ever had before.</p>
<p>The product of Kryptonian genetic engineering, Doomsday is an ultra-powered, mindlessly raging beast who has the ability to regenerate (even after death) and evolve to adapt to whatever harms him. In his first battle with Steel, however, he shows the ability to mimic the powers of those he is fighting. After making short work of Steel and the other would-be Supermen (and Supergirl), rather than kill them as he would ave done in the past, Doomsday gathers them up and teleports them to a mysterious spaceship. At this point the story shifts back to the pages of <em>Action Comics</em>.</p>
<p>Shortly after defeating Luthor, the original Superman makes his way to Doomsday&#8217;s ship, which ends up containing a “pocket universe.” For those not familiar with pocket universes in the world of comics, they are self-contained universes that operate on their own space-time continuum. They can be as big or as small as they need to be and time can go faster/slower with zero regard for the universe in which all the other characters exist. In other words, they are a blank check for writers to do whatever they want and not worry about the logistics. The one contained inside this mysterious ship is no different. Much like the internet, the ship&#8217;s innards are a series of tubes, some that apparently go for hundreds of thousands of miles. Upon breaking into the pocket universe in <em>Action Comics</em> #900, Superman finds the imprisoned characters bearing his symbol and another major surprise: Doomsday is still dead from his previous defeat, and the monster the others have been fighting are actually multiple monsters, each a clone created by Luthor for the sole purpose of distracting Superman while Luthor pursued the Black Lantern ring.</p>
<p>It would seem Luthor&#8217;s plan was not a brilliant one, as Superman didn&#8217;t even pursue any of the Doomsdays until after defeating Luthor himself. What follows are really just the unforeseen consequence of Luthor&#8217;s original plan. The ship itself was not something Luthor created, but rather something he stumbled acroos in outer space. He simply decided to setup shop and use it as a place to keep the other “Supermen” captive. </p>

Shortly there after, a new enemy appears, an intelligent Doomsday-like creature wearing cybernetic battle armor and calling himself “The Doomslayer.” Truly awful name aside, introducing a new foe three issues before ending an entire series seemed like a ballsy move on DC&#8217;s part. By the end of the story however, it turns out the move wasn&#8217;t so ballsy after all. </p>
<p>The Doomslayer&#8217;s stated objective is to end the existence of Doomsday and all his clones, but his plan to do so involves destroying the entire planet Earth. After meeting resistance from the heroes, The Doomslayer unleashes the remaining three Doomsday clones on Earth, again as a distraction to the heroes, leaving Superman alone to face the creature and save the world yet again.</p>
<p>In the last issue, a final series of twists reveals the ship to be an intelligent sentient being that traveled to our world as a “probe” from another dimension. The probe was damaged after Luthor discovered it and was unable to return to its home dimension.  The Doomslayer, it turns out, is just the forth Doomsday clone, the one Supergirl tossed away. Spending thousands, possibly millions of years stuck in the pocket dimension (remember, it has its own space-time continuum) this Doomsday evolved to mimic the technology and intelligence of the probe it was stuck inside of, thus becoming The Doomslayer. His new perspective of Doomsday as an “infection” needing to be purged is a likely reflection of the ship&#8217;s own view of him as he was trapped inside it. </p>
<p>So the final battle of <em>Action Comics</em> really just ends up being Superman vs Doomsday one last time, but after nine issues of build-up the confrontation itself is a big letdown. I loved the original battle between Superman and Doomsday, but this final battle is resolved so quickly I can&#8217;t help but think more was planned, but ultimately discarded after DC&#8217;s decision to reboot everything.</p>
<p>Instead of a massive battle, the story is resolved extremely quickly as Superman repairs the damaged ship, which then transports back to its home dimension, taking every version of Doomsday with him. The story then shifts to the following evening, with Clark Kent and Lois Lane having dinner. Lois tells  Clark just how inspiring he is to others and gives quick summary of all he good that Superman does for the world. While a poignant scene, it seems like it was hastily added after it was decided this would be the final issue.</p>
<p>While &#8220;The Reign of the Doomsdays&#8221; is not an awful storyline, it certainly did not live up to its potential. As a crossover story, the writing and artwork are really hit-and-miss along the way, until the story hits part 6 and is produced by Paul Cornell and Axel Gimenez the rest of the way.  Cornell is a great writer and still manages to produce some decent scenes, but the general lack of exposition and hasty resolution leaves a bit to be desired. The best written portions of the story actually come when the story crosses into the pages of Justice League and Superman/Batman Annual, both of which are penned by James Robinson.  </p>
<p>A lot of different artists contribute to this story, especially in <em>Action Comics</em> 900, but Gimenez&#8217;s work is given the most space. I am not a huge fan of Gimenez&#8217;s artwork. He draws Superman too young for my tastes, making him look like he just celebrated his 21st birthday, and his sketchy detail work made it hard to tell The Doomslayer was actually wearing armor until I saw another artist&#8217;s variant cover artwork. It&#8217;s not bad, it&#8217;s just not great, and <em>Action Comics</em> really deserved something great at the end.</p>

<p>My favorite essay from the <em>The Idler</em>&#8216;s first year &#8212; a difficult choice among so many stellar pieces &#8212; is <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/07/19/harry-potter-and-the-evil-empire/" target="_blank">&#8220;Harry Potter and the Evil Empire&#8221;</a> by Angela Vasquez-Giroux. I am the ideal target reader for Ms. Vasquez-Giroux&#8217;s prose: a baseball-loving, Yankee-hating bookworm who resisted the charms of Harry Potter because, as the author puts it, I&#8217;m often a &#8220;hater of all things beloved by everyone else.&#8221; Typical of <em>The Idler</em>&#8216;s broad cross-cultural vision, this essay manages to connect literature, sport, Johnny Damon, &#8220;and his ragtag gang of self-named misfits, the idiots, lacking pedigree and pinstripe.&#8221; Yes, Ms. Vasquez-Giroux, the Yankees ARE Voldemort. . . and watching them fail at the end of the season/story is a pleasure I&#8217;m delighted to know we share.</p>
<p>Congrats on your first year, <em>The Idler</em>. Here&#8217;s to many more.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always loved <em>The Idler</em>&#8216;s slogan: &#8220;Refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy.&#8221; There&#8217;s an unabashed nerdiness that pervades the site, and every time I finish a piece on <em>The Idler</em>, I think to myself, &#8220;These are my kind of people.&#8221; Case in point: Gavin, Andrew, and Daniel&#8217;s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/category/gamers-club/final-fantasy-vii/" target="_blank">re-playthrough of Final Fantasy VII</a>. The <a href="http://idler-mag.com/category/gamers-club/" target="_blank">&#8220;Gamers&#8217; Club&#8221;</a> concept was creative, the format loose, and the end product was a series of thoroughly enjoyable and insightful posts about how the game has aged (Daniel: <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/06/let%E2%80%99s-do-this-thing/" target="_blank">&#8220;Two women fighting over Cloud? This was like crack to a sixteen-year-old boy, I tell ya. Years later, it still makes for great story telling.&#8221;</a>), how it should be played (see Andrew&#8217;s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/10/ffvii-character-and-materia-management/" target="_blank">character and materia management piece</a>), and sometimes, in the process, what it says about its players (Gavin: <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/10/ffvii-breaking-through-the-wall/" target="_blank">&#8220;I feel a bit underpowered, but I always feel underpowered at the end.&#8221;</a>). Anyone who hasn&#8217;t played <em>FFVII</em> will still be able to appreciate the enthusiasm and quality of analysis, but if you have a nostalgic adoration for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series like I do, you&#8217;ll understand why exactly these are your kind of people.</p>

<p>What’s amazing about <em>The Idler</em> is that it not only provides personal perspective and entertaining exploration in each of its writer’s articles, but it also doesn’t coddle current crazes and pander to passing obsessions. Readers will find delightful deliberations on a wide array of topics like Kevin Mattison’s personal reactions to the work of French filmmaker Jacques Tati through the lens of Slyvain Chomet’s <em>The Illusionist</em> in Kevin&#8217;s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/06/24/jacques-tatis-there-and-back-again/">&#8220;Jacques Tatis, there and back again.&#8221;</a> It’s this type of feature that not only highlights a current work that deserves more universal attention, but also turns its attention to an artist that has been grossly overlooked by the pages of mainstream cinematic history. Mr. Mattison’s response to <em>The Illusionist</em> is not only intelligent, it also perfectly demonstrates the individualized personalities that make <em>The Idler</em> so engaging.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The editors of <em>The Idler</em> are a shadowy, self-effacing crew. But to help celebrate the site&#8217;s birthday, they put together a list (in no particular order) of some of their favorite pieces from <em>The Idler</em>&#8216;s most frequent columnists. It&#8217;s been an amazing first year, and they claim to be very much looking forward to the second year, so long as it doesn&#8217;t involve actually doing too much of anything.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong></p>
<p>Of all our wonderful <em>Idler</em> writers, I think Jill’s the one who hit her stride the most quickly and consistently. With her cooking pieces she invited you into her kitchen, equally as excited to share her failures as she was her successes. But for me she really nailed it with her <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/04/18/liquid-indulgence-a-personal-history-of-drinking/">&#8220;Liquid indulgence&#8221;</a> piece, which stepped a little bit outside of that comfortable groove to share the kind of funny, personal story that makes you want to hang out in that kitchen in the first place. <em>&#8211;KM</em> </p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong></p>
<p>This was a tough one for me. Mike’s got a couple of really great pieces about fostering a relationship with his son through music that really stuck with me. But in the end I had to go with <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/06/27/u2-in-east-lansing-before-and-after/">&#8220;U2 in East Lansing (before and after)&#8221;</a> because I think it epitomizes what makes Mike such a great <em>Idler</em> contributor: Pure passion. If you missed this show, Mike’s piece is about as close as you can get to real thing. <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p><strong>Angela Vasquez-Giroux</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to not start each of these paragraphs with the words &#8220;this is my favorite writer,&#8221; but Angela Vasquez-Giroux was exactly the sort of person I had in mind when <em>The Idler</em> got started, and we were lucky to get her. She&#8217;s a passionate baseball fan with a deep and intimate knowledge of the game, and she will never, ever simply give me summary of last night&#8217;s game. She may give me a poem about listening to a game with her grandfather, complain about Fox&#8217;s truly atrocious baseball broadcasts, call Jeter out for being a cheater, or when I&#8217;m lucky, do all of these things at once. My favorite piece of Angela&#8217;s however, has to be <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/14/doing-everything-you-do-in-a-skirt-or-some-thoughts-on-being-a-girl-doing-boy-things/">&#8220;Doing everything you do, in a skirt, or, Some thoughts on being a girl, doing boy things,&#8221;</a> because not only does Angela know more about baseball than you, and love the game more than you do, she&#8217;ll outrun, out throw, and outhit you, all while wearing a skirt. Softball, after all, is just baseball &#8220;with bigger balls.&#8221; Damn right. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>

<p>One of <em>The Idler</em>’s strengths lies in offering unique perspectives on common topics. I think we really hit it out of the park when that unique perspective gets an origin story. Ana’s &#8220;PopHeart&#8221; column has covered many topics that often cross paths with one another, but I never expected to read anything like <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/05/25/the-macho-man-vs-the-family-secrets/">&#8220;The Macho Man vs. the family secrets&#8221;</a> which links former WWF superstar Randy “Macho Man” Savage with escapism from childhood trauma. Even less expected was how touching it turned out to be.  <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p><strong>Kate Sloan</strong></p>
<p>Editing <em>The Idler</em> is usually one of the cushiest jobs around (which is good, because the pay sucks). Every once in a while a writer and I will send ideas back and forth, or I&#8217;ll give a gentle nudge with a possible suggestion when someone is coming up on a deadline (or has watched one go by), but normally I just get to sit back and click the &#8220;publish&#8221; button. Kate Sloan&#8217;s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/03/gaying-up-gotham/">&#8220;Gaying up Gotham&#8221;</a> was a rare exception to this, where after talking about a couple of ideas, Kate sent me a short draft of a piece about the homoerotic undertones between Two-Face and the Batman in Frank Miller&#8217;s <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>. I sent a short note to Kate that said something like, &#8220;You CANNOT write about homosexuality in <em>The Dark Knight</em> without writing about the Joker.&#8221; Kate wrote back to say something like &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re probably right,&#8221; and her second draft knocked it out of the park. It&#8217;s still one of the smartest things we&#8217;ve run. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong></p>
<p>I have always found religion to be fascinating, especially in social context. In <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/02/non-catholic-catholicism-jesus-christ-superstar/">&#8220;Non-Catholic Catholicism: <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>,&#8221;</a> Rosemary discusses one of the few (maybe the only?) successful pop culture/ Catholic cross-overs, and why it works so well (admitting that some of its success has a little to do with Jesus and the apostles&#8217; hot factor).  <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Simone</strong></p>
<p>I desperately want to know where Andrew Simone finds the games that he writes about, and the second most important reason I read him is that I haven&#8217;t figured it out yet. The <em>most</em> important reason I read (and share) Andrew&#8217;s writing is that he&#8217;s incredibly in touch with the ways that form and content work together (or don&#8217;t) in video games, particularly independent PC and browser games. One of the best examples of Andrew&#8217;s keen sensibility can be found in his review of the <em>Octodad</em> game, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/16/a-day-in-the-life/">&#8220;A Day in the Life.&#8221;</a> It&#8217;s a unique and clever game, but Andrew really gets to the heart of it by observing that the player&#8217;s clumsy control of the Octodad character is actually the central feature of the game itself. Being an octopus pretending to be a human is <em>hard</em>, and Octodad (and Andrew) get it exactly right. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Mattison has written a number of strong pieces, and he&#8217;s right up there in the group of people who have done the most writing for the site (so it feels almost like a crime to pick just one piece), but the column I keep coming back to is the one where he surprised me. I&#8217;ve known Kevin for a long time, and watched a lot of movies with him, but &#8220;The madness of Klaus Kinski&#8221; felt like a bolt out of the blue. I had never heard of Kinski, much less ever seen any of his work, but using Werner Herzog&#8217;s documentary <em>My Best Fiend Klaus Kinski</em> as a jumping-off point, Kevin quickly but thoroughly introduces the life and career of this troubled but brilliant man. It wasn&#8217;t until I watched the trailer for Kinski&#8217;s <em>Nosferatu the Vampyre</em> that I realized that I&#8217;d been staring at his face on a poster in Kevin&#8217;s basement for years. I get a little bit of something like that from nearly everything that Kevin writes. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>
<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong></p>
<p>I’ve known my co-editor for quite some time now, and he’s always had a gift for finding significance in the seemingly insignificant. Knowing this, I was excited to read his video game column, as I was sure it would offer some unique insight into a medium often struggling for legitimacy. He hasn’t disappointed. And being the former roommate mentioned in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/28/1410/">&#8220;The horror before words,&#8221;</a> it was impossible for me to not pick it. Plus, it contains the line, “the difference between fear and horror is the difference between being killed and being eaten.” ‘nuff said. <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>We owe a great deal of gratitude to all our writers. We may complain about the editor pay, but the contributor pay is just as bad. Your creativity, idiosyncrasies, and keystrokes make <em>The Idler</em> what it is, word by word, idea by idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Listen up, tricks. I’ve been struggling with something lately, and that something is online dating.</p>
<p>I’m not looking to online date per say, as I’m more than a little bit taken, but I’m not exactly asking for a friend either.</p>
<p>You probably don’t know this but online dating sites are very prominent tools in the gayverse. One in particular, <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/" target="_blank">OkCupid</a>, is the undisputed leader, at least here on the coast. Literally every friend I make IRL is on this site. At dinner parties they talk about their match, friend, and enemy percentages with each other. It was like an impenetrable secret language. And because I have a very hard time not participating in social conversations I decided to join. Also, my girlfriend has a profile, and I’m a big believer in relationship equality.</p>
<p>Setting up a profile was easy enough. Pick the two decent photos of yourself taken in the last year. Write some B.S. in the about me section about liking nature and expression and cooking for others (you’ve gotta look marketable). List movies and books and music that make you look smart but not pretentious. Try to write a joke. It’s okay if it’s just a little funny, no one expects you to be Tina Fey. And then, the questions.</p>
<p>Dear god, this site has questions for days. Intimate questions that you not only answer but indicate acceptable answers for potential matches, and then rate the importance of this question to you.</p>
<p>It’s more exhausting than taxes. </p>
<p>My profile is only 80% complete. According to the sidebar threats it will remain at 80% until I write 500 words in my profile. I’m not trying to write a college application essay here. I’m trying to make more friends who like dinosaurs and stupid comedies and nerdy librarian stuff. </p>
<p>I assume online dating is popular in universes other than the queer one I inhabit here in Boston, but I would think to a lesser extent. Though a quick informal survey of my straight friends seems to indicate EVERYone is on this site. We, the people, like that it’s free and that the interface is friendly, and that building your profile works like a personality quiz.</p>
<p>Several of my friends are currently in serious relationships that began on what my friend Jess calls the Cupes. Some of these relationships have lasted longer than many of my other friends’ first marriages. </p>
<p>So what is it about this site that is so appealing to the girl scouts of Boston?</p>
<p>Well, for starters, a lot of us are on there. It also has cool analytics, like what geographical locations would be most favorable to you, getting laid-wise.</p>

<p>It’s a great way to pseudo-stalk lesbians in the area. That way, when you go out with your friends to Queeraoke you can point out everyone in the room you recognize from their profiles and maybe even include awkward message exchange anecdotes. The site acts as a tool for shrinking a kind of disparate, marginalized community. It’s our local coffee shop/ grocery store/ bar. </p>
<p>The demographic is young. And anything that gets popular is able to retain momentum for that reason. You’re not going to use an unpopular dating site and significantly diminish your chances of meeting the lady/dude of your dreams. </p>
<p>According to my friend D., “There is no other way to meet them because they all stay at home with their cats.” You gays, she’s so right. Just because you leave the closet doesn’t mean you leave the living room. </p>
<p>Sites like this make a semi-invisible community more visible to its members. And Boston, being a city of transplants, benefits because all queers need queer friends in their new city, and it’s always better to see a photo or to know before meeting if the person is a big Nickleback fan. It’s inexcusable, no matter how pretty their face is. </p>
<p>I also hear it has great Harry Potter quizzes. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week, Detroit Tigers third baseman, catcher, centerfielder, oh-hell-put-him-anywhere-and-he&#8217;ll-play guy Brandon Inge was called up from the Tigers&#8217; Triple-A affiliate in Toledo to join the starting lineup against left-handed pitchers.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Detroit Tigers third baseman, catcher, centerfielder, oh-hell-put-him-anywhere-and-he&#8217;ll-play guy Brandon Inge was called up from the Tigers&#8217; Triple-A affiliate in Toledo to join the starting lineup against left-handed pitchers. A ringing endorsement, I know. Inge was assigned to Toledo earlier this season when his hitting, never stellar, totally bottomed out &#8212; .177 in 239 appearances at the plate.</p>
<p>In Inge&#8217;s first at-bat after rejoining the Tigers, <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011108210617" target="_blank">he hit a home run</a>.</p>
<p>Inge is the kind of player fans either love or hate, often, I think for the same reasons. He&#8217;s only ever played for the Tigers, which is either a sign of loyalty or that Inge isn&#8217;t good enough to play anywhere else. He was a member of the 2003 team that lost more games than any other in the history of the American League, which gives his presence on a team making a playoff run this year a feeling of redemption, or every time he walks to the dugout after striking out serves as a reminder of that team&#8217;s failures. At his best at the plate, he&#8217;s a mediocre hitter, with little power and control who strikes out too much. He participated in the 2009 Home Run Derby and didn&#8217;t hit a single home run. At his best in the field, he&#8217;s a miracle. It&#8217;s a crime that he&#8217;s never won a Golden Glove.</p>
<p>For me, Inge is the last remaining piece of an old puzzle, a link both to the worst Tigers team I ever watched and to the team I&#8217;ve loved more than any other. He played with Bobby Higginson and Dimitri Young. Pudge Rodriguez, who was the first well-paid piece of the Tigers post-2003 rebuilding puzzle, took Inge&#8217;s spot as catcher. He played with Justin Verlander, Magglio Ordóñez, Sean Casey, Curtis Granderson, Kenny Rogers, and Joel Zumaya in 2006. Casey and Rogers were gone the next year. Zumaya has been the walking wounded most of the time since then. Granderson was traded to New York in 2009. Inge is still around.</p>
<p>It may not be for that much longer, and when Inge is done with the Tigers, he&#8217;ll be done for good. Nobody wanted to trade for Inge when Miguel Cabrera took over his spot at third base in 2008. (Inge didn&#8217;t even get his spot back when Cabrera moved to first base, and Carlos Guillén, who was useless at first base, got the chance to be useless at third.) No one picked up Inge on waivers when he was assigned to Toledo. It&#8217;s entirely possible that Inge is too expensive: not enough offense, and defense that will get worse and not better with each passing year.</p>
<p>Even I&#8217;m not romantic enough to say that he deserves a spot just because he seems to be a really great guy, a true professional who has taken everything the team has thrown at him, played everywhere &#8212; <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011108140561" target="_blank">and I mean everywhere</a> &#8212; they&#8217;ve asked him to play. Granderson was a great guy too, and I think trading him was the right move. The Tigers know what they&#8217;re doing, and when Inge really doesn&#8217;t have anything left to offer, they&#8217;ll pay out his contract and let him go. I&#8217;ll be sad, even if it&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to enjoy it while he&#8217;s here, as long as it lasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am mainly a beer drinker, but I like to say I am an “equal opportunity drinker,” so I will try anything once. </p>
<p>When I was prepping for my recent journey to the Keweenaw Peninsula (some 550 miles away from me in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula), I reached out a friend who attended college in the area.</p>
<p>He gave me a detailed list of destinations, attractions, and bars. It was more than enough to go on for my short visit. Then, a few days before I was to set out on my trip, he sent me another email. It contained a simple message:</p>
<p>“Go to Shute&#8217;s in Calumet and have a drink called a Moscow Mule.”</p>

Delicious.”</p>
<p>It sounded good to me. I’m a fan of ginger beer on its own, and bringing vodka to the party would only add to the fun.</p>
<p>Fast forward several days, and I was in Calumet with my girlfriend Steph, and we found Shute’s resting on a corner. It was an old, thin building—but long. It was built in the 1800s during the hay day of copper mining.</p>
<p>We walked in and were amazed by the interior. The bar maintained its Victorian feel and look: dark wood, murals, a glass awning over the bar. A young bartender asked for our order, and I quickly replied “Two Moscow Mules.” He seemed both pleased and surprised by the request, because we stood out like tourists. </p>
<p>I watched him make the drinks, and moments later, they were before us, in copper mugs as my friend promised. The first sip was glorious and refreshing&#8211;it was a hot, sunny day outside. The ginger and lime masked any flavor of the vodka, letting me know this drink could prove dangerous and sneak up on me. </p>
<p>We chatted with the bartender, as we were especially interested in the copper mugs. “I usually ask for a driver’s license to hold when I make those.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked between sips.</p>
<p>“We had a couple of them walk away this winter. And they are $25 a piece.” This price was later confirmed when Steph and I visited a nearby gift shop. </p>
<p>The bartender went on to share more about the drink: it is actually a double shot of vodka, which happened to be Five O’Clock, and he did a slow count while pouring. He had to use Vernor’s ginger ale, as real ginger beer was too expensive, and they were already undercharging at $4 a pop (Travel Tip: you can drink for cheap in the Keweenaw).</p>
<p>While we finished our drinks, the bartender shared some of the history of the bar, the town, and of the early days of mining. History was all around us in Calumet.</p>
<p>It was my first Moscow Mule, and it was worth the drive from Lansing. It will be a drink, and a moment, I will always remember.</p>
