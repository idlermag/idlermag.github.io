										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can’t pause the game because &#8220;Start&#8221; on my Sega Genesis controller is for blocking. </p>
<p>Instead, I jump around from one side of the screen to the other, hoping that I don’t jump on a fireball or impeccably-placed uppercut from the AI-controlled Johnny Cage as my dad passes through the room. I contemplate resetting the game, but I’ve already been playing for thirty minutes out of the hour I’m allotted on school days, and it would take another twenty or so to get this far on the tournament tree. Besides, I&#8217;ve only been able to successfully perform Sub-Zero’s fatality two out of five attempts as I have not quite mastered the timing on the inputs. The round timer is ticking down, and a TIME UP is a cheesy way to win. Besides, that would not provide an opportunity to perform a FATALITY! </p>
<p>Dad sits on the sofa, interested in evaluating the impact of his purchase, which means confirming if I am satisfied. He had gone to Wal-Mart the previous day to acquire the newly-released <em>Street Fighter II: Championship Edition</em>, which was a pretty big deal for Sega in those days as Nintendo had enjoyed a year of exclusivity of the now-legendary <em>Street Fighter II</em> on the Super Nintendo (Entertainment System). This new version of the game made bosses playable and Mirror Matches possible without a Game Genie. Unfortunately, dad got off from work at 5, and by the time he made it across town to our local store, they were sold out. So he picked up the newly-released <em>Mortal Kombat</em> instead, Capcom&#8217;s new rival franchise, thinking that its MA-13 rating was the equivalent of SFII:CE’s. </p>
<p>I cringe, knowing that the Genesis version of <em>Mortal Kombat</em> has a distinct advantage over its SNES counterpart that would go down in infamy:</p>
<p>A, B, A, C, A, B, B </p>
<p>Followed by a screen of text that nobody has ever read more than once and Scorpion&#8217;s &#8220;GET OVER HERE!&#8221; command,</p>
<p>With precision, I perform what would become a staple combo, freezing ice in the famous SF cast via the classic SF “fireball” motion followed by an uppercut and a slide whose inputs required me to release the controller with my right hand and use my thumb and middle-finger to hit the A and C buttons simultaneously with my index finger on the start button, and return my hand to its normal position &#8212; a technique of controller manipulation I would use in many, many fighting games such as <em>Tekken</em> and <em>Soul Calibur</em> for years to come. </p>
<p>“FINISH HIM!” the game demands of me. I grant its request.</p>
<p>F, D, F, A at close range rewards the innocent witness that is my father and me with a darkening background and menacing jingle as Sub-Zero stops halfway into his uppercut animation to remove poor Johnny’s head from his shoulders, blood dripping, spine attached, and raises his newfound trophy in a victory pose reminiscent of your favorite medieval (or if you’re like me, Sengoku-era Japan) film where the enemy general has been decapitated and his army surrenders in morale shock. </p>

<p>“Humph!” my father laughs nervously, “You sure you’re supposed to be playing this?” he asks incredulously, but no real threat. </p>
<p>I am ten years old at the time in 1993. “Yes, dad, I can handle it. I know I’m not supposed to do this to anyone in real life.&#8221; I say this in as a sort of plea, unaware that I wouldn’t even watch my first rated-R movie that didn’t have commercials to cut out all the “bad parts” until I was old enough to drive myself to the movies and buy the damned ticket myself. </p>
<p>Content, perhaps not by my answer, but rather by the fact that his son was making way into manhood for the first time, discovering that violence exists in the real world, and it can be filtered through a virtual environment, my dad left me to my hobby. &#8220;Well, as long as you know that it&#8217;s just a game&#8221; he would offer as <em>conditional</em> approval. </p>
<p>I would witness <em>Mortal Kombat</em> become a trailblazer in the games industry. Alongside <em>Night Trap</em>, which enjoyed a brief moment in the spotlight, and the <em>Doom</em> franchise that would follow a different trajectory than console-based games, gamers would experience revisions to the games rating system, and the emergent discourse known as &#8220;Video Game Violence&#8221; (VGV).  </p>
<p>Ah, yes! You might be old enough to remember those days when the local or national news would continue to show clips of the games I have mentioned above even decades after their popularity had waned.  If there was a more discrete indication of a disconnect between older audiences and younger generations (of gamers), it would be talking about VGV while showing scenes from the now-pixilated <em>Doom II</em> while gamers are playing <em>Soldier of Fortune</em>, a game whose engine was specifically designed to maim enemies as thoroughly as possible, even after death.  </p>
<p>But I am getting ahead of myself. That&#8217;s the kind of game content that I feel goes too far, and that&#8217;s Part 2 of this piece. I would like to go back to games like <em>MK2</em>, which was one of the most highly-anticipated games of its day, and is the first game I remember going to the arcade (do those even exist anymore beyond Dave &amp; Buster&#8217;s?) and learning to place a coin on the dashboard of the machine to indicate &#8220;I got next.&#8221; <em>MK2</em> was <em>FREAKING COOL</em> just by virtue of how Midway continued to consciously contrast the SF franchise, preferring real-life actors in costume with Wrath of the Titans-style stop motion video capture. Furthermore, even with the hyper-violence of the new fatalities, such as torso tearing and arm ripping, the game demonstrated an ironic meta-awareness of itself. I&#8217;m not just talking about the added Friendships or Babalities as non-violent alternatives to what made the franchise famous, but the gratuitous increase of blood and gore rendered the game as comical as serious. Scorpion&#8217;s &#8220;GET OVER HERE&#8221; spear in <em>MK1</em> resulted in a few drips upon contact. <em>MK2</em>&#8216;s version results in wide-spray water hose effect. High Punches now make the blood splash to the floor in ways reminiscent to Sub-Zero&#8217;s <em>MK1</em> fatality, a dramatic change from the first game&#8217;s mist evaporating in mid-air for the same move. Lastly, some fatalities are simply ridiculous, such as Raiden&#8217;s, my favorite character. Both of his fatalities cause his opponents to explode into gibs (gamerspeak for hard-to-identify body parts), which would be cool, except that oftentimes, gamers can count sometimes too many body parts in the pile!</p>

Though <em>Primal Rage</em> only earned a TEEN rating, this shot was quite the, yes, RAGE among &#8220;concerned parents.&#8221; (Read: Media bringing this to the attention of the otherwise oblivious)</p>
<p>This, I think, was the beginning of when &#8220;mature&#8221; content in games began to go wrong as soon as it started.  <em>MK2</em>, by the way, was among the first mainstream games to earn the &#8220;MA-17&#8221; rating by the ESRB. </p>
<p>Beyond the <em>MK</em> franchise, with rare exceptions such as <em>Robocop vs The Terminator</em> on the Sega Genesis, <em>Lethal Enforcers</em>, or <em>Snatcher</em>, VGV on 16-bit consoles was often limited. However, I distinctly remember in the ensuing 32-bit era, <em>Resident Evil</em> for the PS1, where I could shoot a zombie in the head at point-blank with a shotgun, and it would still walk toward me headless for three seconds, blood shooting in the air anime-style, before dying, where a dead zombie was &#8220;marked&#8221; to the player by a pool of blood around the corpse. I emphasize <em>marked</em> because a convention in the pre-<em>RE4</em> days was to have a live zombie APPEAR dead, then scare the gamer by having the zombie grab and chomp on the player&#8217;s leg. The only way to confirm a dead zombie on-screen was the blood pool or no zombies at all. </p>
<p>Rockstar, as celebrated as it is infamous for pushing the boundaries of game content, would port over their flagship franchise <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> the PC to consoles(You can get <em>GTA 1</em> and <em>2</em> for <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/classics/?id=1" target="_blank">FREE</a> by the way) with the pinnacle of its reputation not being <a href="http://youtu.be/yCwi0WBWlHk?t=10m12s" target="_blank">an arbitrary naked male scene</a> in its <em>GTA4</em> expansion &#8220;The Lost and the Damned,&#8221; but a poorly-designed mini-game that was scrapped at the last minute but was discovered by datamining modders, now known as “Hot Coffee,” where the player could control the protagonist having sex with his various girlfriends. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how far video games have come from the <em>MK</em> days. But then again, disturbing in others. far we Hot Coffee ain’t got *** on <em>God of War III</em>, where Kratos has off-screen sex with the goddess Aphrodite, as her buxom, buck-naked, suggestively bisexual concubines watch with eager anticipation and react to the player’s mastery of the on-screen button prompts. In the opposite direction, we have chainsaws on guns in games like <em>Gears of War</em>, and F-bomb marathons in <em>The House of the Dead: Overkill</em> for the Wii. </p>
<p>So it would seem that alongside the &#8220;nerds&#8221; who played video games in the mid to late-80&#8217;s through the 90&#8217;s, over time video games would evolve from something that just nerdy types would be interested into a medium demanding at times to be taken as seriously as we do Hollywood movies (so we&#8217;re not starting with arbitrary dates here, the post-video game crash and the emergence of Nintendo and the NES is where I would start when talking about from where the current video game industry has evolved). After all, we gamers have grown up, and our aesthetic palate would mature with us, right? </p>
<p>RIGHT???</p>
<p>I am not so sure. In my next piece, I would like to address this question of &#8220;mature&#8221; gaming that had emerged more poignantly than ever in this past generation, and how the division between &#8220;casual&#8221; and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gaming alienated and solidified key sectors in the gaming industry. Like the fatalities of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, it gets messy, folks. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Pogue</strong> spends his time spoiling the fun by taking the joke too seriously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sitting in the chair as Marcus, one of the students at Barber College of Lansing, finishes my cut. Gotta keep that lineup tight!</p>
<p>&#8220;Check twenty-three&#8221; he says, still chuckling to himself while still processing his mistake. Two weeks ago, we were discussing video games and he was going on about <em>Ninja Gaiden <strong>Three</strong> </em> on the PS3, and its difficulty. I, being an expert on such topics, <em>especially</em> anything related to ninja &#8212; simulated or otherwise &#8212; assured him that whatever he was playing, it was <strong>not</strong> <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> &#8220;three.&#8221; He promised to take a picture of the jewel box as proof.</p>
<p>Today he confronts me with the cell phone photo. Sure enough, it is not a &#8220;3&#8221; on the jewelbox, but a &#8220;∑.&#8221; I don&#8217;t rub it in, but I am confident that his bashful smile and shaking head is his defense mechanism for his shaken pride as Kevin, the intern of the barber school approaches to evaluate the quality of services rendered.</p>
<p>&#8220;So have you played <em>RAGE</em>?&#8221;</p>
<p>I fail to hear him the first time as the conversation in the chairs across from me concerned the dominance of the SEC in NCAA football, another of my confessed passions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you played <em>RAGE</em>?&#8221; he repeats after I apologize for mishearing him. &#8220;You&#8217;re wearing a <em>Quake</em> shirt, so I thought you&#8217;d heard of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I perform a double-take for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, I am indeed rockin&#8217; my <em>Quake IV</em> tee back from the days when developers and distributors such as EB games offered more substantial pre-order bonuses for games such as t-shirts and recently, a Sonic hat for <em>Sonic Colors</em> instead of that so-called &#8220;exclusive&#8221; downloadable content (DLC) garbage which will be included in future Game of the Year (GOTY) editions a year down the road. In other words, it would require a complete nerd, a fellow hardcore gamer, to recognize the iconography of my shirt <em>and</em> the fact that the game developer Id is responsible for <em>Doom</em>, <em>Quake</em>, and <em>RAGE</em>. Secondly, I had patronized this barber school for five years without having exchanged a single word with Kevin, and now I discover that this dude plays more than <em>Madden</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>!?</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw, I haven&#8217;t gotten a chance to play it,&#8221; I respond, dropping the formal diction that my vocation  requires, &#8220;I mean, I&#8217;ve been tracking it, but it&#8217;s brand-new and man, when  you gott&#8217;a wife-n-kids. . . I just can&#8217;t afford to run out and buy a $60 game anymore, especially when I know it&#8217;s going to drop in price in a few months. I mean, it&#8217;s a first person-shooter (FPS) and I have a personal rule against buying those kinds of games for consoles when I have a gaming rig (PC) in the first place. If it were a more complex game like this game I play called <em>Shogun 2</em> (<em>Total War: Shogun 2</em> actually) though, I&#8217;d buy it first-day just like I used to back in the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I feel you man,&#8221; Kevin agrees. &#8220;I remember those days. <em>Age of Empires</em> and all that. Buy a game and beat it overnight. . . actually I did that with <em>Gears of War 3</em> the other day, but that&#8217;s a rarity these days. Special Occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kevin would confess in this exchange that he himself actually is not &#8220;hardcore&#8221; but he knows people who are, and at times may emulate their tendencies.</p>
<p>You know, 21st century hardcore gamers. The ones who stand in line, rain, sleet, or snow, for 12a.m. releases for the purpose of completing the campaign/main quest or mastering the multiplayer modes and maps before the rest of civilization awakens the following morning, maintaining their gamer supremacy via respawn camping,** premature game reviews, and general petty bragging. These are also the kind of gamers who yearn for the content equation of blood + gore + profanity + nudity= mature = GREATEST OF ALL TIME (GOAT).  This neo-hardcore as opposed to hardcore from the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s who scoff at the idea of save points. But I digress. &#8220;Who is a Hardcore Gamer&#8221;is a column for another day.</p>
<p>Kevin and I, approaching thirty, agreed. Again, why buy a game for $60 when in a few months, one can buy two or sometimes THREE games for the same price? (Personally I am still disgruntled at $60 being the standard for non-Nintendo new releases!) Delayed gratification is one concept that experience in this gaming business has taught me to appreciate. By not bucking to hype, this year I have acquired <em>Vanquish</em>, <em>Bayonetta</em>, <em>Dante&#8217;s Inferno: Divine Edition</em>,  and <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> for about $13 each used, S&amp;H included. That&#8217;s $240 (before tax) worth of games if purchased brand-new before tax for $52. The $188 saved can be used to fill the gas tank a few times, a date night with the Mrs., or (most likely) more video games.</p>
<p>Delayed gratification does have its negative sides. There are often &#8220;sweet spots&#8221; with pricing. I once missed <em>Bayonetta</em> for $10 and had to wait another six months before I located another copy. A Nintendo game like <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em> might sell with a $15 gift card at launch, and it might be two years until a similar deal could be found.  Snooze-n-Lose. Alternatively, the entertainment factor of games like <em>Warhawk</em> and <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em> are contingent upon online components that are more integral than supplemental. If one waits too long, one may miss out participating on the servers while they are both functional <em>and</em> populated. Good luck finding a viable <em>Aliens vs Predator</em> (2010) online community, for example, as compared to launch. Likewise, I have yet to find a lag-free match in <em>Tekken 6</em> since I purchased it mid-2010.</p>
<p>Still, I find that the benefits of &#8220;delayed gratification&#8221; offset the negatives. Purchasing discount games weeks, months, or even years from the release date alleviates the impact potential disappointment. I might have been less offended at <em>MadWorld</em>, a game whose sole selling-point is the vulgarity I mentioned earlier, had I not paid (near) full-price for it (at least <em>No More Heroes</em> was in color). Between <em>MadWorld</em> and <em>House of the Dead: Overkill</em>, never again will I make a compulsory &#8220;hype&#8221; purchase.</p>
<p>These days, the most embarrassing aspect of a gamer of my age and responsibilities is that I don&#8217;t have time to play all of these games that I am (still) buying. Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Steam Christmas sales are in our midst.</p>
<p>** Respawn camping is a strategy in FPS games where one stands near, often behind, a zone where upon death, a player is placed back into the game (respawn). Made particularly infamous (unsportsmanlike and generally a jerk move) in <em>Goldeneye 007</em>  where players did not even have to camp respawn zones, but could place mines in the known locations so that upon respawn, enemy players would instantly die, often before the player could move or even realize that they were ever alive! Spawn camping typically requires an obscenely grotesque understanding of the game as respawns are often randomized, though some players still manage decipher and predict respawn location patterns depending on developer coding. More recent trends include grenade spam in games such as <em>Halo</em>, where upon death on smaller maps, remaining players chuck grenades into known spawn zones hoping for quick, cheap kills (frags). Even casual gamers may be familiar with simply &#8220;camping,&#8221; which is a similar strategy, but not nearly as cheap and frustrating to other players as the former.</p>
