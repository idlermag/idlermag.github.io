										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong>: I&#8217;m not really the romantic sort. That said, I&#8217;m facing a perfect storm this Valentine&#8217;s Day. It&#8217;s the ten-year anniversary of my first date with my wife. (Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Our first date was on Valentine&#8217;s Day. What?) We eloped exactly six months later. And a year after that, we did a ceremony with our families.</p>
<p>So this February 14 is the official start of the year of the ten-year-anniversary. (My wife has already started celebrating unofficially by marking the dates of our first kiss and the day she broke up with her boyfriend of the time.)</p>
<p>My wife and I were housemates before we started dating, and we really started to realize (or admit to ourselves) that we were going to start seeing each other because we&#8217;d curl up on the couch every evening and watch <em>Michael Palin&#8217;s Hemingway Adventure</em> on PBS together. So I bought her a copy and we&#8217;ll spend Valentine&#8217;s Day curled up on the sofa watching it again. (After the kids go to bed, of course.)</p>
<p>So maybe I&#8217;m a bit of a romantic after all.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: I&#8217;ll probably be avoiding facebook and Twitter, because people will be really gross and mushy or will be whining about how they are SO ALONE and I&#8217;d rather not see that. My boyfriend and I don&#8217;t get each other gifts for Valentine&#8217;s Day; we&#8217;d rather spend the day doing something fun. We have a belated date planned for when he comes to visit me in March, and I&#8217;ll be sending him some homemade candy. Or crying over videochat. Either one.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Malta</strong>: Probably using it as an excuse to eat a little candy or two…or ten (not those chalky message hearts, those are gross).  Valentine&#8217;s Day, for me and Husband, is overshadowed by the “Christmas in February” also known as February 13th, Husband’s Birthday.  I happily take the out since I&#8217;m not really enthusiastic about Valentine&#8217;s Day.  Maybe I’m a little jaded, but on the whole I see no point on putting so much pressure on one day in the middle of winter when, let’s face it, everyone in the world is really effing cranky (in Michigan, anyway. –11 degrees with the wind chill making it feel more like I’ll go off my flipping rocker if it takes me longer than one second to get from the front door to my car and I’m supposed to feel romantic all of a sudden?  Not happening).  I&#8217;ve always told Husband I don&#8217;t care about it and we are under no obligation to observe it.</p>
<p>That said, I did give him a Valentine one year.  I used it as a means to make Husband retire one of his favorite jokes. He had explained to me, in jest, that since Pandas wouldn’t/were too stupid to mate to save themselves from extinction we should be able to eat them because they’re on their way out anyway.  Sometimes when I’d ask what he wanted for dinner he’d say “Panda Meat” because he liked to make me mad.  Pandas, in my opinion, are not for eating.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3734" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/14/what-are-you-doing-for-valentines-day/img_6066/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_6066.jpg" data-orig-size="2816,2112" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.6&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot A540&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1297461143&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.8&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="IMG_6066" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_6066.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_6066.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_6066.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="panda" title="IMG_6066" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3734" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_6066.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_6066.jpg?w=600&amp;h=450 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/img_6066.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> So when Valentines Day rolled along he didn’t get a Valentine from me. He got a Valentine from a little Beanie Baby Panda. His soft, bean filled paws offered a Caramello bar (Husband’s favorite) and a little heart shaped sign that read, “Please don’t eat me.  I love you.”</p>
<p>It was a turning point for Husband.  He would never again be able to think about consuming the meat of a Panda without thinking of chocolate and love and the most pathetic tone I could muster for the voice of the adorable little Beanie Baby.  If we do anything on Valentine&#8217;s Day it is to remember that we don’t eat Pandas.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Sloan</strong>: I&#8217;m celebrating Valentine&#8217;s Day by not celebrating Valentine&#8217;s Day. I&#8217;ll be drinking ghetto blasters and writing snarky things on the internet like every other Monday. This is not just because I&#8217;m single; my hope is to one day find someone who enjoys these things, too. That way we could do them together on V-day. Last year I celebrated by going to the Dirty Show in Detroit&mdash;if it&#8217;s running this year (Ed. note: <a href="http://dirtydetroit.com/">It is</a>) and you&#8217;re looking for plans, I highly recommend it: alcohol, cute people, and art. There&#8217;s something for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: What am I doing for Valentine&#8217;s Day? Well, nothing formal. The wife and I will work all day, the kids will do their thing at school and we&#8217;ll pick them up and bring them home. Then my wife will go to her ice skating lessons so she will be able to take our son to the skate rink while I stay home with the kids. Hopefully they will both be tired and fall asleep easily so my wife and I can have a little bit of quiet time.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to Valentines from any of my students. The agency where I work doesn&#8217;t celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day in the classroom but we&#8217;re not stopping families, especially those with siblings that are celebrating in their schools, from bringing in cards to quietly disperse throughout the day. I hope the kids remember me!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ana Holguin</strong>: In my house, this year&#8217;s Best Catch Phrase/New Word Award goes to &#8220;dubs.&#8221;  Months ago my husband Matt was playing The Settlers of Cataan and our friend Adam announced that he had &#8220;dubs sheep.&#8221;  I was painting in the next room as I am completely uninterested in most games of strategy or storytelling (I only like word games) but my ears perked up when I heard &#8220;dubs.&#8221;  &#8220;Dubs&#8221; was immediately added to my lexicon.  So, now if both of my dachshunds are sitting on me I might report &#8220;I have dubs dogs.&#8221;  2 pencils?  Dubs pencils.  </p>
<p>Dubs cheeseburgers please!  </p>
<p>Dubs shows on the DVR.</p>
<p>Dubs.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: I really love the &#8220;What does this mean??&#8221; meme from the <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI">Double Rainbow</a> video. And as much as I hate to admit it, I&#8217;m sort of tired of hearing that things are &#8220;epic.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: It&#8217;s adorable as an adjective, but I fear over-zealous usage of the word &#8220;epic&#8221; has made it lose some of its epic-ness.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong>: The best/worse/best again catch phrase of the year has to be &#8220;dat&#8217;s bold.&#8221;  As in, &#8220;Did you just tell me to shut up?  Dat&#8217;s bold!&#8221; Or, as overheard after the credits began rolling on the latest Harry Potter film (which is only part one of two, lady, so relax).</p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: “Refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy.” Goddamn right!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: Along with many others, I really fell in love with Mumford &amp; Sons. It turns out there are still bands that make real music, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: Most definitely Gogol Bordello&#8217;s marvelous <em>Trans Continental Hustle</em>. It&#8217;s the 5th studio album by the New York gypsy-punk band, and their sound and manifesto keeps getting richer with each release. Seven of the nine band members are immigrants, hailing from Russia, Israel, Ethiopia, Ecuador and China, with lead singer Eugene Hütz from the Ukraine. The video for the new song <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKoQgODwveE">&#8220;Immigrada&#8221;</a> is a powerful look at the face of immigrants in America. Music critic Robert Christgau has called Gogol Bordello &#8220;the world&#8217;s most visionary band,&#8221; a title they&#8217;ve well-earned. </p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: I can’t be giving away the house here, especially as I was planning on writing about this topic throughout January!</p>
<p>I will offer a few hints for you. . . try to guess what I mean. </p>
<p>Hints:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CD model sued the band</li>
<li>She appears to be underwater</li>
<li>There is a bear on the cover</li>
<li>The CD came with a magazine</li>
</ol>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong>: I didn’t make any great effort to stay musically informed until the end of the year when I purchased Arcade Fire’s <em>The Suburbs</em>, Kanye West’s  <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>, Sufjan Steven’s <em>The Age of Adz</em> and Spoon’s <em>Transference</em> all at once.  All were solid purchases (sans maybe <em>Transference</em>, which I found to be pretty underwhelming).  If I were to pick a favorite, though, I’d have to go with The Roots’ <em>How I Got Over</em>.  It’s top-notch hip hop from start to finish, with the band returning to its more up tempo, jazzy. . . roots.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong>: I used to be one of those people who thought that albums were really, really important. Then I had kids, and now I’m lucky to keep up with songs. This year, my favorites were spacey and atmospheric, with an edge of noise poking through, particularly <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5RzpPrOd-4">“Helicopter”</a> by Deerhunter, <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu7jAl9Sxgg">“Birds”</a> by Margot &amp; the Nuclear So and So’s, and <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh4etIJx7Oc">“Nothing but Our Love”</a> by Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: I&#8217;ve rediscovered that you can always make time for yourself to cook. That&#8217;s a great gift.</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: Kino&#8217;s gorgeous new <em>Metropolis</em> on Blu-ray. Even the hardest-to-please, film-restoration purists will fall off their couch at this one. 25 minutes of footage assumed lost for over 70 years was discovered in a film archive in Buenos Aires and added back in, with the rest of the movie painstakingly restored. The disc also boasts a new recording of the original, full-length composed score, which restorers utilized to help properly place the new footage and retain the intended story pacing. You&#8217;ll get chills.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: Fatboy Slim &amp; the Chemical Brothers. Both take me back, well, to the mid-1990s when I was young and relevant. In 2010 both brought smiles to my face and made me feel really good. Trying to find a nice version of a song off the latest Chemical Brothers disc brought me a great quote from the British DJ Pete Tong, “You’re never too old to rave.”</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong>: This year my wonderful wife bought me a record player for my birthday.  I hadn’t had one for nearly 10 years and had found myself frequently missing the soft, looping imperfections of vinyl.  I immediately dug out my original copy of <em>The White Album</em> by The Beatles and played it ad nauseum.  It’s a chaotic album, a brilliant clustering of opposing ideas.  It’s also the album I learned to play guitar to, on my father’s old Alvarez twelve string, strung with six.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong>: This year I discovered that there had been a Wii remake of the old NES game <em>A Boy and his Blob</em>. It’s still a clever concept—you play a boy who has to make his way through the game by transforming his blobular sidekick into different objects (a trampoline, a hole, an anvil, a coconut, etc.) using various flavors of jelly beans. For a system that lacks the processing power of either the Xbox 360 or the PS3, Wii designers do a really amazing job of creating games that are beautiful to look at (<em>Kirby’s Epic Yarn</em> is another great example), and <em>A Boy and his Blob</em> does a great job of being both cartoony and dark, innocent and threatening. It’s a great invocation of childhood, and I don’t have to wait until the girls go to bed to play it. (I also discovered that the original NES <em>A Boy and his Blob</em> isn’t really worth revisiting on its own, but that’s okay too.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: A few years ago, I went to buy <em>RENT</em> tickets for my sister. Too late, I realized it was only the presale, and the actual tickets wouldn&#8217;t go on sale until after Christmas, when there was a chance we wouldn&#8217;t get tickets at all. I needed a password for the presale. On a whim, I started guessing. AND I GUESSED THE PASSWORD (it was &#8220;RENT,&#8221; if you were wondering). We ended up with front-row seats, close enough to see the actors crying real tears. It was probably the best THING I&#8217;ve ever done, let alone gift.</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: An engagement ring&mdash;when I proposed to my fiance on New Year&#8217;s Eve. I got down on one knee and popped the question to him at the stroke of midnight (well, close&mdash;I was 8 minutes late). And yes, you read that correctly. I am a lady and my fiance is a fella. When a friend said to him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s kind of weird that she proposed to you?&#8221; my fiance replied, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;m a good catch?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: A Christmas Day Mix CD to my girlfriend (now wife) for our first Christmas together in 2001. I put a lot of effort into the disc and it felt genuine at the time, does now too. She made me a lamp using stones from the beach in Frankfort and found old-school HUGE Christmas lights that we flipped on while on her couch on Park Lake Road. I still have the lamp.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong>: My wife is Indian.  She is also Jain.  I am neither of these things, a fact her mother was fond of bringing up in the early goings of our relationship.  How would we raise children when she has religion and I have none?  I was able to answer that question this year when my wife was given her first official classroom teaching job and I decided to get her a gift for all of her hard work.</p>
<p>If you entered our home through the kitchen you would see the small, makeshift temple my wife had put together on a bit of free counter space.  It hardly creates an atmosphere of spiritual importance, but our home is small and it would have to do for the time being.  After she got her job I immediately contacted her parents and informed them that I would like to get her a real temple, one that we could put upstairs next to our room in its own space, which is where it now sits.  Her mother was elated.  Score one for the new husband</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ana Holguin</strong>: In my world, you can&#8217;t go wrong with <em>Christmas Cocktails</em> by Ultra Lounge.  It&#8217;s filled with quirky and swingy Xmas favorites that I must admit I sometimes listen to during the non-yule parts of the year.  If you&#8217;ve ever thought that &#8220;Jingle Bells&#8221; needed a &#8220;cha-cha-cha&#8221; after each verse or you like the campy sound of a fay little elf voice interjecting about holly berries during &#8220;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,&#8221; then this album is for you.  Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass make the sweet baby Jesus (and me) smile.  </p>
<p>Check it out, you hep and campy cats. </p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: I won&#8217;t lie, I love me some <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNuZUCpgNeA">Michael Bublé</a>. And my mom, my sister, and I listen to the *NSYNC Christmas CD every year. I don&#8217;t even care how that sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: Despite the fact that I am not Catholic, it&#8217;s still any version of “God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.” That, and Louis Armstrong&#8217;s <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQQU2ykEQqo">“Zat You, Santa Claus?”</a></p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: Duke Pearson’s <em>Merry Ole Soul</em> on Blue Note. While not technically my favorite it is a helluva a disc to listen to under deep blue velvet skies. The disc dates from the late 60s and begins with the slinkiest version of “Sleigh Ride” you will EVER hear, played on piano and celeste. Just a great, soulful and groovy LP to celebrate the season with. (Hint hint, the version of “Sleigh Ride” is on my Christmas Mix, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/06/the-war-against-christmas-music/">The War Against Christmas Music</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong>: I love, love, love “The Christmas Song.” I’m known to break it out in the middle of the summer. It’s a gorgeous, quiet song co-written by one of my secret weaknesses, Mel Tormé, and perfected by Nat King Cole. (Although <a target="new" href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/the-roots-the-christmas-song-122110/1266495/">The Roots</a> did a pretty good job of it this year, too.) I recommend James Brown’s <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryKRcVqsph8">“Santa Claus, Go Straight to the Ghetto”</a> as a chaser.</p>

I don’t do well with them because I have vivid nightmares. I stopped watching horror movies after <em>The Ring</em>, not necessarily because it’s the scariest movie ever, but because I could not get the images out of my head. I had bizarre nightmares for weeks. I love sleep much more than the thrill of fear.</p>
<p>I was going to say that that must mean <em>The Ring</em> (2002) was the scariest movie I’ve seen, but now I&#8217;m thinking it has to be <em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em> (1997). I know. Hear me out.</p>
<p>It was the first horror movie I ever saw. I was in eighth grade. We were spending the night at my friend Hayley’s house, and it was dark and thunderstorming. Hayley’s living room had big picture windows facing the woods that left me glancing over my shoulder every few seconds. Mid-movie, the power went out. We had to crawl our way back through the unfamiliar house in the pitch blackness to her bedroom. I lay the rest of the night sweating, as tense a wire, staring into the black abyss under her bed. I still sometimes shudder when I see Jennifer Love Hewitt.</p>

I’m told that the general atmosphere was one of mirth, and that there was no thought of what effect the movie could be having upon me. After all, there is nothing graphic in the film. Only shot after shot of screaming extras fleeing from produce rolled in their direction by off-camera assistants. My imagination had no difficulty filling in the details. I knew what the screams meant.</p>
<p>My grandmother, unaware, was preparing lunch in the kitchen. The Craigs have always been fond of bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches. I screamed.</p>
<p>I have not eaten a tomato since.</p>

I know the third one at the aquarium is supposed to be really stupid, but come on!  An underwater walkway?  You are completely surrounded by the ocean!  An ocean that will break your stupidly fragile “protective” plastic barrier.  Claustrophobia + sharkfear!! Two words: chomp, chomp.</p>
<p>2. <em>Jurassic Park</em> (mostly the first, but again all of them).  Ok, I don’t get why more people don’t share my paralyzing fear of dinosaurs and their terrifying museum-display bones.  People, dinosaurs are freaking ancient giant bird-lizards that ruled the Earth!  Does not their stature, their mere presence as immobile artifacts give one sublime pause?  Three words: enormous tyrannosaur eyeball!</p>
<p>3. <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (1974).  Not scary like a slasher flick, this movie just creeps and slinks its way under your skin (so to speak).  I didn’t realize how terrified I was until after the movie was over and I began to register how tense my (brain and body) muscles were.  Unlike the first two movies on my list that prey on our baser instincts and primitive fear, Massacre shows us post-rational man and the deepest darkest regions of his mental/emotional life.  *shudder*</p>

I was a weird, introspective child, easily immersed and susceptible to getting swept up in movies to the point of jubilation or terror. I thought hard and deeply about anything I watched, and <em>Cat&#8217;s Eye</em> had enough horrific scenarios to pique my precocious interest and start my wheels turning about how I&mdash;nine-year-old me&mdash;would deal with the torture-related dilemmas brought upon the characters through the fault of their own broad flaws. Would I be able to walk the ledge of a skyscraper over the plummeting dark while pigeons pecked at my fingers? How would I possibly bear it if people I loved were electrocuted while I were forced to watch? Or what if some well-meaning but misguided adult put my pet cat outside for the night so he was unable to protect me from the evil troll that lived in my house? I laid awake that night pondering these serious issues, as well as thinking about how cool it would be to have a troll-fighting cat of my very own. </p>

I remember his sweaty, gaunt visage and creepy smile like it was yesterday. The maggot creature in his likeness was totally creepy but nowhere as creepy as Beck himself. Later I would come to discover his work in the creation of The Living Theater. </p>
<p>As <em>Poltergeist 2</em> descends into a wacky, blue screen nuttiness it sort of loses its edge. Granted, this was a necessary development as Beck died during filming. But when I think about films that scared me, that really creeped me out, the sight of the wincing, sweaty, cult leader that led innocents to their death. </p>
<p>Perhaps this is a testament to the last performance of Beck, the triumph of acting. Maybe it was all his experience with the confrontational theater he founded.  Perhaps in that setting he mastered the art of making another uncomfortable. Perhaps it was my own youth, or the concept of following someone to your own death. Aren’t the things that scare us really just the things that we truly fear?</p>
