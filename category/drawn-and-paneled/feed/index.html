										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was first asked to write for <em>The Idler</em> I was crushed that I couldn’t do it. I had just accepted a job in Boston and had three weeks to leave my position at the Michigan House of Representatives, fly to Boston, apartment hunt, fly back to Michigan, pack, and drive to the Eastern seaboard. When I am busy I have this terribly practical habit of cutting out my “leisure” activities like reading, writing, and sleeping first. </p>
<p>By the time I caught my breath January was upon us. I was an aunt. I had traveled to Detroit twice. And my older sister had gotten married. I was sleeping on a regular basis, more or less. It was time to write.</p>
<p>Gavin and I went back and forth on a few column ideas before settling on comic/graphic novel reviews. I wrote <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/20/watching-out-for-alison-bechdel/">my very first piece for the site</a> on Alison Bechdel. If I were to describe my crush on Alison Bechdel in one word it would be BOUNDLESS. If I could describe it in eight words I would say, I’m ready to put a ring on it.</p>
<p>Bechdel’s long-running strip <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em>, perhaps did more to get me comfortable out of the closet than the previous five years being out of the closet did. </p>
<p>Read her. Love her. Propose to her and I will have to fight you.</p>
<p>It’s terribly hard to pick a favorite <em>Idler</em> column that I didn’t write and not feel like I’m playing favorites. Also, some of my favorites have already been noted by the editors. I love <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/04/18/liquid-indulgence-a-personal-history-of-drinking/">Jill Kolongowski’s piece about us getting unintentionally black out drunk at 5 pm on a sunny patio in downtown Boston on her birthday</a>. The writing is smart and brave and I also like anything that is indirectly about me. </p>
<p>I love Ana Holguin’s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/23/on-winning-and-losing-it/">“On winning and losing it”</a> because it challenged me to consider this trending train wreck in a different way and also made me examine how society was appropriating language. Chain language like #winning is catchy, but people also used to wear stone washed jeans and over-sized pocket t-shirts and Keds. </p>
<p>I also particularly enjoyed Lindsey Malta’s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/22/the-seve-deadly-sins-for-children/">“The seven deadly sins for children,”</a> in which Lindsay deconstructs the holy tome that is the musical movie <em>Rumpelstiltskin</em> (1987) starring Amy Irving and Billy Barty. The breakdown of sins is pitch perfect. I’m hoping she’ll be inspired to do a similar watching of the Disney tales a la this cracked.com piece on <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19336_6-beloved-characters-that-had-undiagnosed-mental-illnesses.html" target="_blank">beloved characters with undiagnosed mental illnesses</a>. </p>
<p>In the past month or so I’ve grown weary of picture books and have instead started writing a few pieces on <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/07/25/living-in-the-nation/">city livin’</a> and <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/08/25/dating-and-taxes/">being queer</a>. Mostly I am biding my time until Bechdel publishes her next book. If her book tour comes to Boston you can bet your idle selves that I will have tales of slipping her my number and a formal proposal in comic form at Harvard Book Store.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been noticing things getting more graphic. I see comics everywhere&mdash;on billboards and the subway and nerdy girls’ Adrian Tomine tote bags. There’s an entire section in a local comic shop devoted to graphic versions of the classics. You can read <em>Jane Erye</em> in word bubbles, friends. That shit has been drawn and paneled. Suddenly high school lit is a little more interesting for those strange souls who don’t adore Dickens as much as I do. It’s the best of times.</p>
<p>In third grade we had to write reports on books we took out from the library. We had two options: We could write something out in the dreaded cursive or we could work with the nice folks in the library to type and illustrate a report as a book. I was one of the Midwest’s most dedicated 8-year-old pterodactyl enthusiasts. I checked out books almost exclusively set in the prehistoric era. I owned two copies of <em>The Land Before Time</em>. And I wrote a book all about dinosaurs and their ways called <em>Paleontologists and Me</em>.</p>
<p>I guess what I’m saying is I started the trend of graphic book reviews. You’re welcome, fellow Americans.</p>
<p><em>The Barnes &amp; Nobel Review</em> hosts a monthly column called <a href="http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Drawn-to-Read/bg-p/drawntoread" target="_blank">&#8220;Drawn to Read,&#8221;</a> which is what this column would have been called if it wasn’t already taken. The column is illustrated by Ward Sutton, whose work has appeared in such lauded publications as <em>Esquire</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, as well as other lesser known outfits like <em>The New York Times</em>. </p>
<p>Sutton’s &#8220;Drawn to Read&#8221; provides short illustrated book reviews of both fiction and nonfiction books. The images and text capture the feel of the book the way a perfectly executed cover or book trailer might. A recent review of <em>Disaster Preparedness: A Memoir</em> by Heather Havrilesky is <a href="http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Drawn-to-Read/Disaster-Preparedness/ba-p/4107" target="_blank">a particularly good example<a>. It seems silly to explain in words what Sutton does graphically to a book composed solely of words, so take a look. It’s the <em>NYT Book Review</em> for the comic lover’s soul.</p>
<p>Last week I noticed another site I love, <a href="http://therumpus.net/" target="_blank">The Rumpus</a>, is also featuring graphic book reviews. <a href="http://therumpus.net/2011/06/horn-reviews-silver-sparrow/" target="_blank">A recent review by Kevin Thomas</a>, a self-described unemployed former film critic, covers <em>Silver Sparrow</em> by Tayari Jones. The review appear as part of <em>Horn! Comix Supplement</em>, the archive of which can all be found <a href="http://horncomixsupplement.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Are there other graphic book reviews I’m missing out on? How do you feel about illustrated reviews of literature? Are you a slave to the <em>NYT</em>&#8216;s Sunday <em>Book Review</em>? Is a graphic novel of <em>Othello</em> the comic kid’s equivalent of cliff notes or just plain awesome?  I might have to read an illustrated classic to find out. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The warm weather’s back, comicomrades! You might remember me telling you once upon a winter that I read exponentially more when I can see my breath outside. That statement was stunningly accurate. Sure, I now have the option of reading a zombie novel under a tree in the commons while I get Hemingway drunk on a balmy afternoon. Don’t think I’m not taking advantage of that. But mostly I find myself gravitating towards the wooden docks next to the Charles where I spend my afternoons napping in direct sunlight like a cat. My mother calls this “a good way to end up dead” but I just call it summer. </p>
<p>There’s something about the skyscraper-reflected sun that makes the city a little more inviting, a little more homey. Squinting into the sun, the city seems like it isn’t all right angles and glass and stone. It’s a little bit softer. It’s trees, and water, and hissing geese too. </p>
<p>Speaking of a softer world, Joey Comeau and Emily Horne began <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=3" target="_blank">their weekly web comic of the same name</a> all the way back in 2003. The thing I love most about this comic is that it breaks a lot of comic rules. Each strip is comprised of three photographs taken by Horne often of friends and local haunts. Each panel is laced with <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=87" target="_blank">typewritten text that’s an equal mix of funny and tragic</a>. This comic is sardonic, and I delight in <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=65" target="_blank">its dark humor</a> more than I laugh at it. </p>
<p>Comeau, who is the author of two novels as well, also has a fun side project called <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/oqindex.php" target="_blank">Overqualified</a>. He writes cover letters for jobs he has no real interest in obtaining. My mancrush, Ryan North describes the letters thusly, &#8220;Overqualified&#8217;s cover letters are like a slap in the face, but the slap is hilarious, and you can&#8217;t stop laughing, and as soon as it&#8217;s over you want to tell all your friends about the slap. You know the kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>He also does a series of interviews called “I Am Other People”. <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/bw-display.php?id=1" target="_blank">This one</a> is my favorite, obv. </p>
<p>Horne’s weekly photo journal <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/iblamethesea/" target="_blank">i blame the sea</a> is also worth a look. Her pictures are frighteningly good at capturing mood. </p>
<p>There’s a lovely little <a href="http://xkcd.com/144/" target="_blank">parody of ASW</a> on XKCD.</p>
<p>Pro tip: don’t forget to hover over the final panel for extra text, often the best bit.</p>
<p>Is this comic for you? Or do you prefer something a little more Sunday paper-ish? Let me know! Have anything mean to say in 140 characters or less? Get at me on twitter @kate_sloan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay kids, this week we&#8217;re back to the round up. I hope you all know how hard it&#8217;s been for me NOT to make a rodeo joke, but I know no one appreciates a clown.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a></em>. I wasn&#8217;t familiar with this comic before my poll, but now that it&#8217;s on my radar I&#8217;m noticing that a lot of people I like really like it. The comic is funny in a nerd-meets-cynic vein, but not in a gimmicky way. It&#8217;s definitely not for everyone, it’s <em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?db=comics&amp;id=2075#comic">a little science heavy</a></em>. But if you&#8217;re sarcastic and tend to distrust the <em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=1863#comic">thinking-power of others</a></em> you&#8217;ll love it. Also, the comic makes <em><a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?db=comics&amp;id=1937#comic">gay jokes</a></em> that don’t leave me incredibly insulted,  which is always a plus.</p>
<p><em>PhD  (Piled Higher and Deeper) comics</em>. This is another comic for the smarties, mostly commiserating/making fun of the glamorous life in the research trenches experienced by grad students. Hours in the library and lab, instant coffee, fine ramen cuisine  any time your <em><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1367)desires">little black heart desires</a></em>. I like this comic because it makes me really happy that I’m not in a<em><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=125"> dark enough place to go to grad school</a></em>. Also, it uses a lot of words and I get most of the jokes.</p>
<p>The final smart comic of the week is none other than Kate Beaton’s <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em>. I like to think of this as the ultimate smart girl comic. You might recall Rosemary Van Deuren’s excellent piece: <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/20/kate-beaton-is-smarter-than-all-of-us/">Kate Beaton is Smarter than All of Us</a>. It’s still true. This comic is funny in a <em><a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=262">hot-librarian-making-Shakespeare-puns</a></em> kind of way. Luckily, that is one of two languages in which I am fluent. <em><a href="http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=202">Lit jokes aside</a></em>, <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em> is best known for its historical comics. These often focus on a historical figure or event and are effin&#8217; hilarious. Except <em><a href="http://harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=27">this one</a></em>, this one is grisly as fck.</p>
<p>Any guesses on this week’s winner? Really, not one guess? This week’s nonexistent prize goes to <em>Hark! A Vagrant</em>, for making me feel secure in my <em><a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=213">love of Poe jokes</a></em>.</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite in the Round Up so far? Or another comic to recommend? Send me your comments on twitter: @kate_sloan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I was taking my nerdiness to a whole new level on poetryfoundation.org. A friend had tipped me off to a series the site ran a few years ago called <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2011/04/poem-as-comic-strip-redux/" target="_blank">“The Poem as Comic Strip.”</a> The project asks some of the most respected and celebrated comic artists of today to interpret any poem in the Poetry Foundation&#8217;s archives from “<em>Beowulf</em> to present.” This collaboration allows for the artists and readers to explore the intersection of graphic and verse. While comics and poems might seem as unlikely bedfellows as <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/179402" target="_blank">Gabriel Bell</a> and <a href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/blog/uploaded_images/dickinson.jpg" target="_blank">Emily Dickinson</a>, the two have a few things in common. For one, both poems and comics are known for their use of space, especially white space, on the page. Combine this with the careful pacing necessary to both mediums and you have a sound combination&mdash;one worth further exploration.</p>
<p>There’s even a strip that uses a poem by the poet-in-residence at my alma mater: <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/179224" target="_blank">Diane<br />
Wakoski</a>.</p>
<p>The foundation seems to have removed the complete strips from the site, but Google Images pulls up some <a href="http://26.media.tumblr.com/WXCapTL7Fcktyik9S2bkbYPA_500.gif" target="_blank">interesting results</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I asked my friends to suggest web comics the response I received was a little staggering. I had no idea they had been holding out on me like that&mdash;I hadn’t heard of at least half of the comics mentioned. I’m sure you’re all through the last bunch by now. Let’s while away our day together.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/001.html" target="_blank">Mark Doesn’t Understand Animals</a>. I knew about this one already. This comic has one joke and that joke is that Mark doesn’t understand animals. That’s it. Brilliant. This comic does not get old, friends. I read the entire archive every week or so and I laugh every time. This comic is also <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/035.html" target="_blank">really PG</a>. My 12-year-old sister loves it too. This comic has maybe me <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/021.html" target="_blank">want a bunny</a> like I have never wanted anything before. The only drawback is that is doesn’t update often enough for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/" target="_blank">Toothpaste for Dinner</a>. I’ve been reading <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/042211/leaning-back-in-chairs.gif" target="_blank">this comic</a> since college. The best use of your time with this comic is to click random because there are so many to look at. I don’t want you to get overwhelmed. I like this comic because the character is a lovable jerk and that’s how I like to view myself. “Tell us how you really feel” is something I hear at least once a day. <em>Toothpaste for Dinner</em> is written by Drew who also writes another one of my favorite comics, <a href="http://www.marriedtothesea.com/" target="_blank">Married to the Sea</a>. He’s married to <a href="http://nataliedee.com/" target="_blank">Natalie Dee</a> and has a mustache. <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/randomComicViewer.php" target="_blank">This</a> will keep you busy for about a week assuming you don’t sleep or shower (I know, no one sleeps or showers anyways).</p>
<p><em>Exploding Dog</em>. Do you guys remember expoldingdog.com? Really <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/everybreathyoutake.html" target="_blank">emo</a> <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/wishfors.html" target="_blank">pictures</a> you looked at in high school and totally related to? Well, it turns out they’re still awesome. The creator of <em>Exploding Dog</em> draws pictures inspired by the titles readers email him. Let’s all email him something awesome and sad and see who wins: <a href="mailto:sambrown@explodingdog.com">sambrown@explodingdog.com</a>. Going through a few these are mostly about <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/youllloveittrustme2.html" target="_blank">love and miscommunication and miscommunicated love</a>. <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/soonyoullbelikenew.html" target="_blank">Even the happy ones make me feel a little sad</a>, kind of like every song by Johnny Cash.             </p>
<p>Okay friends, these should keep  you from having to answer emails for about a week. You’re welcome.  This week’s winner is <em>Mark Doesn’t Understand Animals</em> because <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/018.html" target="_blank">he. just. doesn’t</a>.                </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It occurred to me that in these dark and difficult times we’re all looking for more ways to waste time on the internet. With the hours between 9 to 5 and 11 to 4am seemingly endless, it’s not always easy to stumble upon websites to fill your time. Amirite? Of course I am.</p>
<p>After a very scrupulous and (un)official survey* of experts I am able to present you with Webcomic Roundup, part I.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.explosm.net/comics/2396/" target="_blank">Cyanide &amp; Happiness</a> updates daily. The comic, created by Kris Wilson in 2004 with contributions by Matt Melvin, Rob DenBleyker and Dave McElfatrick takes a slightly sardonic look at <a href="http://www.explosm.net/comics/454/" target="_blank">nerds</a> in their natural habitat and uncovers the awesome beneath the sweater vests. This comic is great for periodic perusing for a few reasons: the <a href="http://www.explosm.net/comics/308/" target="_blank">references</a> are pretty simple to get; also, there’s really not a post-to-post storyline to worry about. Not for the easily offended, but really, <a href="http://www.explosm.net/comics/2393/" target="_blank">what is</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=uncle+dolan" target="_blank">Next up, Uncle Dolan</a>. Before you click that link, let me give you the same warning I received: Uncle Dolan is NSFW. And that’s not a term I throw around, as I consider the blog <a href="http://effingdykes.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Effing Dykes</a> SFW. This is strictly for the second endless time slot (11 to 4 am). Essentially, Uncle Dolan is a poorly drawn and terribly behaved version of Donald Duck. His hobbies seem to include attempted fornication with other badly drawn animals and public defecation. It’s not for the easily offended, but really, what is?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php" target="_blank">And then there were Dinosaur Comics</a>. This was one of the very first webcomics I ever read. Loved by nerds and paleontologists alike, this comic is written by Ryan North with art courtesy of Clipart. I’m kidding about the Clipart, but the art is static with only the text changing from day to day. The comics take place in conversations between our sexy hero, T-Rex, Dromiceiomimus (the smart, librarianish one), and Utahraptor (the constant foil to T-Rex’s awesome optimism). This comic explores issues like <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1506" target="_blank">death</a>, <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1502" target="_blank">the dangers of drinking</a>, and <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=1550" target="_blank">depression</a>. Fun fact: when I had wrist surgery my first year of college I posted a dinosaur comic link on my Livejournal (go ahead and judge, jerks, you had one too) and Ryan North commented on it! Then he mailed me some sexy and exciting stickers including one of T-Rex that reads: “Ladies, please, one at a time,” which I will never stick to anything ever for fear of ruining it.</p>
<p>Let’s make this a tournament, shall we? For each webcomic roundup I’ll arbitrarily declare a winner. After a nonexistent period of deliberation, this week’s winner is <em>Dinosaur Comics</em> due to my actual crush on Ryan North and my intellectual crush on T-Rex.</p>
<p>*I posted a status on facebook asking my friends to list their favorite webcomics. We have PhDs in wasting time with the truly awesome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know that being an adult and missing home is unspeakably lame. Which is why I’m writing about it. If we’re being honest, and I hope that by now we are, lately I’ve been as homesick as a tween at straight camp. It&#8217;s a strange experience, feeling transplanted. The midwest is terribly different from east coast and though I love my strange new town, at times I feel as though I’m a mermaid on land.</p>

<p>Just last week a strange woman on the train put her arm around me as she berated the Amish for not getting with the times (her pronunciation “Eh-mish,” weird, I know). I was mostly disturbed by her assumption that I agreed. I also learned last week that it&#8217;s unacceptable to call Converse high tops tennis shoes. Correct: sneakers, or if you’re feeling jaunty, kicks.</p>
<p>This week I read the first issue of <em>Strangetown</em> from Oni Press written by Chynna Clugston and Ian Shaughnessy, illustrated by Clugston. The comic was lettered by Bryan Lee O’Malley (<em>Scott Pilgrim</em>!) and his partner Hope Larson. This black and white comic is set in the fictional banana slug capital of the world <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Grangeton</span> Strangetown, Oregon. Tense panels open on a young Vanora, our heroine of unknown origins, being ejected from the sea after a shipwreck. She is then taken in by a stranger for a decade before heading across the Pacific on her own. Seemingly orphaned Vanora makes her now solitary way to Strangetown.</p>
<p>Her apartment hunting leads her to a boarding house above Cutty Sark, a tea house with fine teas and finer spirits. Above the bar lives Parker Radlett, Roscoe, her bulldog, and a cast of characters that puts my own to shame. Due to a previous tenant’s sudden demise, a covet-worthy room with death stain and a view is there to welcome to Vanora for $75 a month. I know, I can’t wrap my mind around it either. Where do I sign up?</p>
<p>Her new roommates in this strange place include Freddy Astaire (a porn star name for the accident prone), the resident spaz, age 19; Barbara &#8220;Babs&#8221; Barbarosa, one of Strangetown’s most accomplished drinkers; and Vernon Leach, a reclusive scribbler of depressing romance novels (an up-and-coming market).</p>
<p>The 32-page comic is punctuated with three song titles, which only heighten the tale’s strange cred. Our first, which appears as the young Varona is shipwrecked and not yet rescued, is The Cure’s &#8220;Caterpillar.&#8221; It’s high time we bring back the Edward Scissorhands hair, you guys. I believe the gays will be willing to lead this revolution. I’ll look into it.</p>
<p>The second embedded tune is The Call’s &#8220;The Walls Came Down,&#8221; which makes its appearance shortly after Vanora accepts the room. The final song to the <em>Strangetown</em> soundtrack is Wire’s &#8220;Used To.&#8221; This song fades us out of issue one as the tea house fills with dock workers in need of something a little stronger than Earl Grey. Vanora, recognizing a tired face or two in the crowd, reacts appropriately by flipping her table and cowering in a corner. Annnnnnd, fade to black.</p>
<p>This issue of <em>Strangetown</em> was a gift from a friend of mine who spent a month in stumptown last summer. I have since been unable to locate issue two, though I am dying to track it down just so I can love it. Leads on obtaining a copy will be graciously accepted.</p>

Since I watched <em>Inception</em>, probably. Dreaming for me is only ever the illegitimate child of stress and careless imbibing, as a result dreams are closer to nightmares in which I must fix ALL of the things and save the mermaid village from the meteor. But this morning I found myself somewhere between waking life and an R.E.M. cycle as I read Anders Nilsen’s <em>Dogs &amp; Water</em>. I was originally drawn to this book because I really like the name Anders. I suppose I was also snared by the cover, which depicts a guy kneeling on barren ground, wearing a backpack with a teddy bear strapped to it, being presented with a rifle by a member of the dog pack he runs with.</p>
<p>The book’s inner landscape is stark and panel-less. It is, in fact, just as magical as I would expect anything by an Anders to be. Containing only the sparest amounts of text, much of it is illegible scribble. The illustrations flow into one another with no dividing border, creating a fluidity that only heightens the dreamlike state of reading.</p>

His only companions are the stuffed bear strapped to his bag, whose wisdom he defers to in all matters, and later, a pack of wild dogs. The nameless man’s journey is a severe mix of loneliness and traumatic encounters. A chance encounter with a buck, who attempts to steal his bear, dissolves into a fist fight. A feral dog pack keeps him from freezing to death before they come across and devour a human corpse. I once read somewhere that the common house cat will begin eating its owner before the body grows cold. I came across this fact years ago, and it is still one of the most haunting things I believe to be true.</p>
<p>The journey is interspersed with further dream-like digressions comprised of scenes of a boat journey  gone awry. Eventually ending in a shipwreck, which leaves the bear dismembered and the man likely drowned, they encounter a man swimming  to Asia.  Every event in <em>Dogs &amp; Water</em> happens out of time and space, and while everything that happens is possible (except maybe the deer fight),  nothing is likely.</p>

And on the way that wandering with no plan can be just as constrictive and monotonous as following the roadmap.</p>
<p>Nilsen is the author of several books including <em>Don’t Go Where I Can’t Follow</em> and <em>Monologues for the Coming Plague</em>. His work has appeared in <em>The Best American Comics</em> and <em>The Best American Non-Required Reading</em> anthologies, as well as <em>The Believer</em>, <em>The Chicago Reader</em> and elsewhere. For a brief period, Nilsen attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before withdrawing to do comics full time. His <a href="http://themonologuist.blogspot.com/" target="new">blog</a> showcases occasional new material. His <a href="http://www.andersbrekhusnilsen.com/" target="new">website</a> showcases some of his other work including several cover illustrations, like <a href="http://andersbrekhusnilsen.com/images/illustration_images/hca_fairy_tales.jpg" target="new">this excellent piece</a> done for the edition of <em>Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tales</em> published by Penguin in 2006.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/grief-made-graphic/Content?oid=925842" target="new">a rather melancholy piece</a>, the Chicago reader describes Nilsen’s work as “hallucinatory style of fable in which animals and young men ruminate about their existential crises.” I couldn’t agree more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My original plan for this evening was to shower and then spend three hours pondering the truth of how we never know what we’ve got ‘til it’s gone. But since my hot water has yet to return since running off with its druggie boyfriend my night is suddenly free for reading and reflection. Lucky you.</p>
<p>I recently read a graphic novel about another gal who ran away with her druggie boyfriend, and the fact that it ended well leaves me feeling hopeful. <em>Ivy</em> is <a href="http://saraholeksyk.com/" target="new">Sarah Olesyk</a>’s first full-length graphic novel chock-full of angst, cemeteries, and bad decisions. Published by Oni Press in January of this year, <em>Ivy</em>, was originally a five-part series, recently completed, collected and bound. Oleksyk’s style is beautiful and arresting, yet simple. The shading and detail in these black-and-white panels lend the drawings an amazing warmth and depth.</p>

<p><em>Ivy</em> follows its seventeen-year-old namesake as she navigates the trenches of <a href="http://saraholeksyk.com/ivy02.html" target="new">art</a> and algebra, friendships and falling-outs, love and disillusion, and the college application process. Ivy struggles to keep her explosive temper in check, which is easily ignited by crotchety teachers, her absent yet feels-her-opinion-is-law mother, and all manner of life’s minor tragedies.</p>

While on a school trip to Boston (from Maine) to explore art schools, Ivy meets a young criminal (as all young men are, to quote my stepfather) named Josh. They become infatuated instantly, more or less promising having each other at hello and promising to exchange letters.</p>
<p>While Josh’s letters are immediately disturbing (you get me, we belong together, blah blah), Ivy, in the way of all lovesick young women, eats. it. up. This book is a good reminder that the people we like quickly are often not as amazing as we imagine them to be. When Ivy flees her home in Maine after an altercation with her mother, she and Josh join forces and hit the road. The beginning plays out like every young fantasy I ever had running away for love, needing no one and living off the land. Which is really only practical if you’re Pocahontas. (I’m not.)</p>

Ivy’s a modern-day heroine, headstrong if a little directionless. Oleksyk does an excellent job of capturing the complete stupidity and recklessness of teenage love. Even as Ivy berates everyone in her path, punches lockers, alienates her friends, buys drugs, and gets suspended, I found myself pulling for her happiness.</p>
<p>Oleksyk&#8217;s secret weapon in these pages is place. Ivy repeatedly visits an old overpass in the local cemetery, which becomes a character in its own way. Ivy repeatedly retreats to the overpass to seek solace, savor triumph and lick her wounds. I also really enjoyed seeing Ivy’s art on Oleksyk’s pages a mingling of stark portraits and crude caricatures.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, most teenagers are obnoxious jerks. I definitely was and Ivy is too. And that’s what I I love about her.</p>
<p>While perhaps not about to be lauded as a groundbreaking original tale, <em>Ivy</em> hints at the promise of what’s to come from the extremely talented Oleksyk. It’s definitely worth a read, even if only to cite later as you pretentiously inform others that you read her “early work” before she was “mainstream.” There’s no serious-reader buzzkill worse than liking an artist whose work is widely enjoyed. So get in early while the getting’s obscure.</p>
