										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe the first time I tasted prosecco was on the Paris to Milan Artesia night train. It’s called the Stendhal service and that’s a perfect name for a journey between these two cities. Stendhal was the pen name of Marie-Henri Beyle, a French writer well known for his unrequited love for  Mathilde, Countess Dembowska, whom he met while living in Milan.</p>
<p>Stendhal’s book, <em>On Love</em> is the reaction to this experience. It’s an attempt to dissect romantic love in a logical, level-headed way. As a Frenchman suffering from failed Italian-style desire, he made a worthy attempt. </p>
<blockquote><p>To make this course of action clear to my French readers, I must explain that in Italy, a country very far away from us, people are still driven to despair by love.</p></blockquote>
<p>We left Paris Bercy station in the early evening, scheduled to arrive in Milano Centrale station the next morning. I was feeling in a champagne state, but the dining car waiter suggested in French we should try an Italian sparkling wine instead, to put our hearts and minds in the mood of our destination.</p>
<p>Prosecco is dry, lemony, and bubbly. It’s created from predominately Prosecco grapes in the northern Veneto region of Italy in the foothills of the Alps on the opposite side of Italy from where we were going. We missed most of the scenery through the Alps since we traveled at night, but it was April. It was quite chilly and we saw snow on the ground whenever we slowed down.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Milan it was pouring rain. Our hotel, the most luxurious I’ve ever stayed in, was only a few blocks away.  After unsuccessfully trying to flag a taxi for more than a half-hour, we started to walk, umbrellas in one hand, one black, tourist-style, small, wheelie suitcase each in the other.</p>
<p>We arrived, dripping wet like two drowned rats, at the grand entrance of Hotel Principe di Savoia at 6:30 am. The bellman were not quite sure whether to laugh or cry at the sight of us. Rain puddles sloshed beneath us at the reception desk. I’m not sure if it was my hotel Platinum status or our pathetic state that forced the fastest check-in I’ve ever experienced, especially for an Italian hotel so early on a Saturday morning. </p>
<p>They showed us to a wondrous room. My traveling companion called it the Gianni Versace suite because of the gilt, multiple mirrors, and heavy velvet brocade of the bedding and draperies. </p>
<p>After a hot shower, a nap, and a late room service breakfast, we ventured out. The sun was shining.  Our first stop was the “quadrilatero della moda&#8221; where the luxury brands of Italian fashion live: via Manzoni, via Montenapoleone, via della Spiga and via Sant&#8217;Andrea. A lovely lunch included more prosecco.</p>
<p>When I came back to the U.S. the brand of prosecco I saw most often in the liquor stores was <a href="http://www.mionettousa.com/prosecco-il.php" target="_blank">Mionetto “IL” Prosecco D.o.c. di Treviso</a>. It’s a black bottle with a distinctive golden swirl. I drink Prosecco almost every time I eat Italian, at least as an aperitif. Some of the better restaurants surprisingly don’t serve it, since it’s not well known.  </p>
<p>It should be.</p>
<p>Although there are other very fine versions available, this Mionetto is not expensive, typically about $12.99 here in Chicago. If you’re a wine snob you might think that’s because the bottle is sealed with a generic 21-teeth crown cork bottle cap rather than a traditional foil covered cork inside the wire housing called the &#8220;cage&#8221;. The champagne ceremony of flipping up the wire ring of the cage, turning it exactly six half-turns counter-clockwise, freeing the cage from the neck of the bottle and then loudly popping a cork is lost. </p>
<p>But what you gain in fun bubbles is worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They say you can’t go home again. For me it’s too easy. I now live two doors down from the house where I grew up. My parents have been keeping tabs on the neighborhood for fifty years.</p>
<p>It’s that kind of continuity, unique to fewer and fewer communities in the United States, that binds us together. And that’s why a large turnout was expected for our all-years Catholic grade school reunion this past weekend. </p>
<p>A $40 ticket purchased from the church rectory in advance bought a full buffet and all the &#8220;well&#8221; drinks, beer, and wine you could handle. Chicken, mostaccioli, BBQ beef sandwiches. Or maybe it was pork. Trust me this was not a fussy crowd. </p>
<p>“Well&#8221; drinks meant no premium brand vodka, scotch, or gin. Nothing fancy or frilly. I did see martinis, but they were served in a tumbler. Mix the distilled generic brand liquor of your choice with 7-Up, Coke, tonic, orange juice or, maybe, pineapple juice if you’re my sister. Beer selection was a choice of various bottles, all of them domestic, except Corona &#8212; which might as well be domestic.</p>
<p>Wine &#8212; I didn’t even look &#8212; was probably Gallo jug.</p>
<p>I chose Michelob. Because that’s what we always drank as kids &#8212; I started drinking at 14 &#8212; and I wasn’t planning on having very many. The selection was limited to Ultra . Only 95 calories. </p>
<p>Because now we’re worried about calories.</p>
<p>Recently there was a big controversy over the possibility that Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, was going to discontinue selling Old Style beer. Wrigley Field patrons care about Old Style based on faux nostalgia rather than genuine, basic, blue-collar draft beer chops. The Pabst Brewing Company still produces all the old-fashioned, now in fashion with the hipsters, beers that used to be made by family-owned breweries. Old Style is what we drank in cans at my uncle’s tavern across the street from the old Comiskey Park. </p>
<p>When we were sixteen.</p>
<p>Pabst Blue Ribbon, Blatz, Strohs, and Old Style were our go-to beers when short of cash or when drinking in volume. But we all had jobs. I worked the cash register at the local hamburgers, hotdogs, and Italian beef joint across from Tony&#8217;s, the liquor store. Our boyfriends stocked Tony&#8217;s shelves. And sometimes they slipped a case or two out the back on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>The classic brands came in cans. Huggies hide cans well for drinking clandestinely behind the school, at the forest preserve, sitting on a park bench or, our favorite, in the cemetery. But when we didn’t have to worry about being seen we preferred Michelob or, for special occasions, Heineken.</p>
<p>It all came back to me as I watched the night progress at the reunion. I could have predicted who would be left at 11:00pm for last call. Some were trying to decide which bar to go next. There are plenty to choose from on Western Avenue and the beer is still cheap. I knew where that would lead. Once you agreed to go to the next place, it was impossible to leave before closing. In the old days that would have then led to breakfast at 24-hour Karson&#8217;s. But Karson&#8217;s isn&#8217;t there anymore.  </p>
<p>When we were in college, I called it “diminishing marginal returns.” At that age it was about going home with someone. If your plan wasn’t made by last call &#8212; some bars in Chicago serve until 5am on the weekends &#8212; no good would come of staying just a little longer. The later it got, the worse the outlook.</p>
<p>I figured it was time to go home.</p>
<p>I was thinking as I said goodbye that my family was lucky no one had ever landed in jail or the emergency room because of alcohol. Many families we grew up with had not been so fortunate. More than a few folks we knew ended up in rehab, Alcoholics Anonymous, and Narcotics Anonymous by the time they got out of college and started a family. We all have friends who, because of booze or drugs, are already gone. It was a sobering to look around and see how many that were still lingering now carry a gun as a Chicago Police or Sheriff’s Police officer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell for tequila long before I ever traveled to Mexico. From what I remember &#8212; although tequila memories are always a bit blurry &#8212; I’ve never actually fallen because of tequila. That honor goes to the Mexican dark beer, <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/75/667" target="_blank">Negra Modelo</a>. Cerveza oscura  &#8212; dark beer &#8212; was my drink of choice on the weekends in <a href="http://www.stuinmobiliaria.com/ixtapa-zihuatanejo-costa-grande-guerrero/" target="_blank">Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo</a> after I started living and working in Mexico.  </p>
<p>A story for another day. . .</p>
<p>When I was in high school and college my liquor was whiskey. It wasn’t until I graduated and started working that I tasted tequila. My best friend on my first job, as an internal auditor at the first “too big to fail bank” <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/04/18/mckenna-speaks-at-american-accounting-assn-public-interest-conference/" target="_blank">Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago</a>, was the oldest of five children of Mexican immigrants. Maria invited me to all the family’s gatherings. </p>
<p>Tequila was an important part of parties at their house, and the men &#8212; and Maria’s mother, sisters, and aunts – drank tequila shots to celebrate the new year, a birthday, a baptism, or just about any happy occasion and all the sad ones. Maria’s father, Rodolfo, taught me a rule of thumb for drinking tequila – one is never enough and three is too many.</p>
<p>When I started working in Mexico following that rule kept me safe.</p>
<p>I went to Mexico – and Argentina and Brazil – in 1997 as the project leader for J.P. Morgan’s Year 2000 (Y2K) project in Latin America. At that time, I was working for KPMG Consulting. Later I would go to work for J.P. Morgan directly in Latin America so I could stay on the project and in the region. I returned to the states at the end of 2001 after returning to BearingPoint, the successor firm of KPMG Consulting, once the Y2K project was completed.</p>
<p>During the early years of the project, 1997-1998, I worked primarily in Mexico. It was closer to New York, where the JP Morgan global team was based, and I preferred Mexico to Brazil or Argentina. Not that I didn’t like the other two countries. They have their charms, but Mexico was where I felt most comfortable.</p>
<p>I was the boss. As a woman, a foreign woman, you might think I had a hard time. Not at all. I could read and write Spanish fairly well when I arrived and worked hard to learn how to understand spoken Spanish and to speak as an educated professional during my time there. </p>
<p>My team, all men, were a big help in achieving that goal. The best way to learn a language, after loving with it, is to socialize using it.</p>
<p>The majority of the team came from the local KPMG offices and the rest from the local J.P. Morgan offices. There were a few women working with me in Argentina and Brazil, but in Mexico City it was all men. Management assigned primarily the younger professionals to help me with the tedious testing and documentation tasks needed to successfully complete the projects in each country before the start of the new millennium.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, KPMG is KPMG all over the world. We worked hard and played harder. The Mexican professionals treated me like a queen. We celebrated a project milestone or just the end of a long week together and I never had to eat alone if I didn’t want to. I never felt alone or unsafe in Mexico City. </p>
<p>One of the restaurants we liked to go was Mezzanotte, in Polanco on Avenida Presidente Masaryk. It was great because they had excellent Italian food and then, later in the evening, it turned into a nightclub. If you stayed through dinner you could keep your table and we danced the nights away in between them.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to taking tequila “la bandera,&#8221; Mexican flag style at Mezzanotte. The waiter serves three shot glasses. One has tequila blanco, another has lime juice for the green of the flag and the third contains sangrita, a spicy tomato juice chaser for red. I don’t know if it’s traditional but the guys always made me shout “Viva Mexico!” when we drank “la Bandera.”  </p>
<p>In short time I realized I really liked the taste of tequila. That can be a dangerous and expensive bow to the local culture, since I was never served less than a reposado, or aged 100% agave tequila. More often they ordered an añejo, the finest. I acquired a preference for <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a>, which is wasted if not taken straight. But a lady, and the boss, should not routinely drink her staff of young men under the table via tequila shots. It’s both tacky and a career-limiting move.  </p>
<p>Another restaurant, La Valentina in Polanco , was where the team introduced me to <a href="http://www.cocktailtimes.com/original/don_paloma.shtml" target="_blank">the Paloma</a>. Take a tall glass, some ice, a generous helping of tequila and Squirt. The carbonation in the lemon-lime flavored Mexican version of Squirt &#8212; much more pungent than Squirt available in the United States &#8212; serves as an inebriation antidote. You can have the flavor of tequila, and much more of it than doing straight shots, and remain upright for much longer. This approach, too, has its limits but I thankfully never reached them in any unpleasant way.</p>
<p>Another place the guys took me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Garibaldi" target="_blank">Plaza Garibaldi</a>, the <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2007/12/31/musings-on-the-eve-of-the-new-year/" target="_blank">center of mariachi</a> in Mexico City. The best cantina &#8212; and one a woman is allowed to enter &#8212; is <a href="http://www.planeteyetraveler.com/2010/06/24/cantina-crawl-salon-tenampa/" target="_blank">Salón Tenampa</a>. The only thing you drink there is tequila and only by the shot. All the better to get drunk enough to sing along. I’m still a big fan of mariachi. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mofzQYHbOw" target="_blank">“Volver, volver, volver a tus brazos otra vez. . .”</a> </p>
<p>I didn’t go home to Chicago much during this period. The Christmas holiday is the one time I always went back to cold, snowy Chicago. After a while the city seemed so much less warm than Mexico. I always picked up a bottle of very good tequila &#8212; something different each time but always an añejo &#8212; for Christmas at Maria’s and shots with her father. Each year I also bought Cuervo’s annual Reserva de la Familia special edition tequila in a wooden box hand-painted by a Mexican artist. My favorite one is <a href="http://www.cuervo.com/products/box.aspx?artist=grabados-de-artemio" target="_blank">the first, 1997</a>, by Artemio Rodriguez because it’s a typical Mexican drawing, white on blue.</p>
<p>There’s a bottle of <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a> in my cabinet now. There’s also a bottle of Cuervo for margaritas and one of those long, tall, blue bottles containing <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/reposados/corralejo-tequila-reposado.html" target="_blank">Corralejo Reposado</a>.</p>
<p>I have my tequila but I do miss <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/02/02/special-for-forbes-a-business-travel-story-about-mexico/" target="_blank">Mexico</a> mucho.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’re the first thing I think of in the morning. I’ve never smoked, but I imagine it’s a similar craving. Should I make a pot or run to the corner café? When my head is heavy with sinusitis, it’s impossible to lift it off the pillow.  On these days I need coffee to keep me from blowing my brains out.</p>
<p>If I drank the night before, I can mistake the dull throbbing for a hangover. But I rarely drink enough, unfortunately to be hung-over. If only I could drown my sorrows and my sniffles in enough Vicodin and very fine wine.</p>
<p>Gulp two extra-strength Tylenol from the bottle on the nightstand. When I wake up listening to the Pacific ocean in Mexico, I always feel better. It’s the sea air and the ability to blame tequila for whatever hurts.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine coffee life before Starbucks. When I travel to New York or Washington D.C., they feed my beast, quickly and conveniently. Here in the U.S., a four-shot, venti, vanilla latte is always around the next corner, never more than a few steps away.</p>
<p>When I lived in South America, it was Starbucks that I missed the most. It’s impossible to get a take-out coffee to save your life in Argentina or Brazil. In Buenos Aires, if you ask at a café for a coffee “para llevar”, that is, “to go”, they squint their eyes and give you a very funny look.</p>
<p>“To go? But why? Relax, sit down, take an espresso and then go to work. It can wait. ”</p>
<p>There is no driving and drinking in Latin America. Coffee that is. Only a foreigner would think about walking down the street with a paper cup full of espresso.</p>
<p>When I order my four-shot drink in Chicago, sometimes iced in warm weather, the baristas do a double-take. “Are you ok?” they ask. “Whole milk? Are you sure?”</p>
<p><em>Really</em>…If I order four shots of espresso, cut with a double dose of vanilla syrup, do you really think I give a flying tomato about fat calories?</p>
<p>Every once and a while I try to cut down. I hear caffeine is bad for women in all sorts of ways. But I’ve been drinking coffee since I was ten or eleven. My grandmother served it as a warmer-upper when we stayed over, in brown melamine teacups.  My mother fed it to all six of us before school on cold mornings.</p>
<p>The electric coffeepot is always perking at my parents’ house, even though now, because of my father’s heart, they drink decaf.  A percolator keeps the coffee hotter than a drip coffeemaker. And we always drink our coffee with half and half.  I just can’t stomach it with milk or, god-forbid, 2% or skim. My sister takes her coffee with Equal, a bow to a diet of sorts, but good old regular sugar is still my vice.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I drink too much on an empty stomach at the office, my knees start twitching uncontrollably under my desk. But the absence of coffee in my life feels like an absent lover. My head aches, my limbs go limp, and I crave, too much, a pillow and my blanket to hide from the sunrise.</p>
