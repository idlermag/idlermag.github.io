					<description><![CDATA[Ok, couldn&#039;t wait, and I do like it. Until last year I complained that he never seemed to hit the clutch homerun, and then that horrible night for him last October in which all of us felt betrayed, and  for a minute I even went through thoughts that I had waisted countless hours watching this manCHILD lead my team into a classic colapse..........and then......I was reminded that he is only human, and I am guilty of some of the exact same mistakes, and was left wondering how I would act in his shoes. I know it wouldn&#039;t be pretty, but I think he has made us all believers of the notion that he has made positive changes, and it has shown. This man IS the MVP in the American League. Loved your comment about single handedly keeping them on &quot;life support&quot; because thats exactly what he did ........for a while.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Michael Rosenberg in the &lt;i&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/i&gt; agrees with you. (He even cites the 3 home run in the game after Cabrera&#039;s child was born.) :-)
