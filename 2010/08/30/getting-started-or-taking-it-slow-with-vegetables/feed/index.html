					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Even while I’m eating, I’m already looking forward to what I’m going to eat next.&quot;

You have no idea what a relief it is to know I&#039;m not the only person who does that!  I eagerly await more of your normal person&#039;s perspective!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2010/08/30/getting-started-or-taking-it-slow-with-vegetables/#comment-7&quot;&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt;.

So weird to see my name places... no, I&#039;m totally with you, Anna. I think it&#039;s a very good way to become aware of what you&#039;re eating and what to avoid, especially if you have weight loss goals. You are also a very healthy and disciplined person--I think lots of people end up using calorie counting as an excuse for restrictive eating and unhealthy habits, or they cut back too far and end up binging on other things because they&#039;re hungry. 

That said, I&#039;m not a diet expert in any sense of the word. I just know I&#039;m not disciplined enough to count calories :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey friend--I saw this linked on TWITTER of all places. I know you&#039;ll appreciate that. :) However, I must disagree with you on one point--counting calories is not always BS. I view it as the easiest measure for myself to stay aware of how much I&#039;m eating and it&#039;s worked like a charm thus far. 

That said, I&#039;m pretty excited to read about these interesting things called vegetables.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Food tastes good for a reason. We crave things for a reason. We are supposed to enjoy food.&quot;

I had almost the exact same discussion with my mom the other day. Well, less of a discussion and more of a monologue, really, since I talked and she mostly nodded. I recently had to move back home, and since living in a house with stocked pantries and no grocery budget I&#039;m beginning to notice an upward change in my weight. But I love food and I&#039;m not going to starve myself so that I look at 26 like I did at 16. I look forward to reading! And not least with the hope I&#039;ll learn some secret trick that makes veggies taste like candy.]]></description>
