Another non-horror director who did a solid horror film is Rob Reiner with &quot;Misery&quot;. Whether you want to call that horror or not is debatable, but it was certainly outside of his usual comfort zone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ah yes!  &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; was pretty fun.  I suppose films like &quot;Inside&quot; just don&#039;t appeal to me.  I can&#039;t really handle them.  Certainly a well made flick, though.  

The Trailer for &quot;Don&#039;t be afraid&quot; looks pretty great and I had a lot of fun re-watching the original (in segments) on youtube.  Looking forward to that one as well.

&quot;The Descent 2&quot; is going to be on Instant soon.  We shall see, but I have a feeling it will just be a passable, if not somewhat shallow, rehashing of the original.  Part of the thrill of that film was the build-up.  There&#039;s simply nothing to build up to in the sequel.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dug &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; as well as &quot;Inside&quot;, which you hated. I have a lot of hope for &quot;Don&#039;t Be Afraid of the Dark&quot;, which Guillermo Del Toro produced. What are the chances &quot;The Descent Part 2&quot; is any good?]]></description>
