Shock Waves is a pretty fun flick. And while I wouldn&#039;t necessarily recommend viewing Zombie Lake, I appreciate the comment ; )]]></description>

I believe you are correct.  I&#039;m relatively certain all three stories are based off of Richard Matheson stories.  I&#039;m also relatively certain that nearly every word that man wrote ended up on screen in one form or another!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those bad, campy movies really do give me the creeps sometimes!  

Kev, that Trilogy of Terror with Karen Black and the Zuni doll, isn&#039;t that plot based off a short story?  I feel certain I&#039;ve read a story like that, and it ends with the little doll getting baked in the oven or something, only that just makes things worse.  Has my memory gone completely sideways?]]></description>
