Yeah, those comic book films seem particularly prone to the ole Hollywood mulligan.  Batman and the Fantastic Four have already been re-booted and soon we&#039;ll be treated to a new Superman, Spiderman and X-Men: First Class.]]></description>

&quot;Hostel&quot; is still an active franchise. &quot;Hostel, Part III&quot; just filmed in the D! I anticipate that &quot;Saw 3D&quot; will be a huge hit and if &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot; taught me anything it&#039;s that Hollywood can&#039;t be trusted. So, I think there is still some fuel in those tanks and we&#039;ll be treated to endless sequels before the inevitable remake. But look at something like &quot;Spider-Man&quot; which was made in 2002 and in 2012 will be getting a complete reboot. If there is money to be made, the cycle will speed up as needed.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So do you think that we have a good 10-15 years before we have to worry about a &quot;Saw&quot; or &quot;Hostel&quot; remake? Or do you think the cycles is speeding up?]]></description>

Man, have I got a soft spot for that &#039;88 The Blob remake!  Love the motorcycle drivin&#039;, mullet sporting hero.  Love the fact the that Saw star Shawnee Smith is the heroine.  Love the scene where her little brother gets killed (Who the hell saw THAT coming?!).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t have enough space to list them all but 3 other worth-while remakes are:

The Blob (1988)
My Bloody Valentine 3D (2008)
The Crazies (2010)

Don&#039;t skip the originals (well maybe &quot;The Blob&quot;) but those 3 are solid.]]></description>
