					<description><![CDATA[[...] Kate Beaton is smarter than all of us (via The&#160;Idler)     Reading Kate Beaton&#039;s comics makes me feel both smarter and dumber at the same time.

She&#039;s aaaaawwwweeeesome.&#034; But for those of you who don&#039;t already know that she&#039;s awesome, Kate Beaton draws cartoons about history.

					<description><![CDATA[I am surprised that someone would draw cartoons about history. This is certainly unique. This may encourage people who have hated history to like it. Teachers sure have made it like going to the dentist for some of us. Their lectures were not as well received in high school until new teachers came to us for a few weeks. They put life into the subjects, and taught us like they enjoyed history. This person must like history to make it into cartoons! Thanks for taking on this subject.]]></description>
