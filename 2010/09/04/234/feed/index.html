					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post....a former music student, flautist and composer, I could never have music on in the background because I always started to analyse it the minute it came on. When the kids came along I chose silence because I needed my mind to be still.

Of course, you can&#039;t just stick them up in a silent tower so no seductive music comes by on a white charger to carry them off. It came anyway, and it did steal them away. First it was in the car, now they have it everywhere. My brain is busy again, charting bass lines, adding harmonies, and they devour any new material (Currently Cheryl Cole) voraciously. As you say, music is always right.]]></description>
