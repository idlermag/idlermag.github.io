					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2010/09/03/panic-in-the-70s/#comment-29&quot;&gt;Tony Comstock&lt;/a&gt;.

Yeah, I think it&#039;s hard to argue that any era of filmmaking wasn&#039;t driven by the box office. There was, however, something of a shift of day-to-day artistic control on a film from the studio to the director, no? Or at least that&#039;s the narrative we&#039;ve been sold--&quot;a crop of young directors influenced by the French new wave brought auteur filmmaking to the US!&quot;

I&#039;d also be interested in how the paranoid sub-genre related to earlier films such as &quot;The Manchurian Candidate.&quot; What&#039;s the difference between 50s and 70s paranoia? (Fear-of-other in &quot;Manchuria&quot; and the Bond films to fear-of-self in the 70s?)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;&quot;In the 100+ year history of cinema, there is no doubt in my mind that the 70s represented the best era of filmmaking. It was a time driven by creativity, not box office.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

Yes to the first sentence. No no no NO!!! to the second.]]></description>
