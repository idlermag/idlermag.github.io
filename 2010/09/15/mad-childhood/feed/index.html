					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s also the little boy from the first season whom Betty baby-sits (while his mom&#039;s working for the Kennedy campaign); he walks in on Betty in the bathroom, then asks for a lock of her hair. His mom confronts Betty for giving it to him, and Betty slaps her; later, she confides in him, left alone in a car. 

The kids are already strange, just like their parents. They&#039;re our parents. They&#039;re us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks.  Yeah, sometimes I just laugh out loud at what a beast that mama is and other times I fantasize about the kids&#039; awful futures.  Therapy, so much therapy.  On another note, I kind of love how the parents don&#039;t care because it shows that maybe we aren&#039;t all wired to be good parents.  The Drapers seem to have a family because they&#039;re &quot;supposed to&quot;--and that myth is still floating around today.]]></description>
