					<description><![CDATA[Eating lobster is a total sensory experience as Jill so aptly describes.  Lobster leaves bits of the shell in the hands of the one who cracks open the shell. These particles fester for days so that the sensory experience (pain) continues for days. Mr.let-me rescue-the damsel-in-distress-waiter got pain while Ms. K got the best sensory experience (taste)!*
*Butter cancels any germs Mr. Waiter may have had on his hands.!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Blue claw crabs are excellent, both to catch and to eat. This Summer they made a roaring comeback in the brackish lake near our house, and offered many hours of amusement with my daughters and fine eating as well. 

But.

Scallops really are the queen of all shellfish. Whether it&#039;s bay scallops from the lagoons of Baja California, or sea scallops from the deep cold water off Nova Scotia, there is nothing that comes from the sea that is quite as wonderful.

So keep the beer and push the scallops on down!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Jess, I&#039;ll venture that is Jill doesn&#039;t like lobsters, scallops, or oysters, then the delight that is crab will be lost on her as well. 

Jill, bad luck for you then, but no worries. Just push &#039;em over here -- oysters, lobsters, crabs, the whole lot -- and I&#039;ll get rid of them for you. And coudl you pass the beer? I&#039;m parched!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m completely appalled by the waiter taking the meat out with his bare hands.  That is poor form, no matter how difficult the lobster is!  Did he even ask first? 

You should try crab sometime. It has a very similar taste to lobster, but is much more flaky and soft rather than chewy.  It can be a bit of a process and sometimes a pain, but if you go to a more casual beach place, it can be a lot of fun after a few drinks .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For this reason, I am so happy most meats are served completely dismembered and looking as unlike the animal they came from as possible. 

If they weren&#039;t, I&#039;d have to go back to being a vegetarian, which, while &quot;good&quot;, wasn&#039;t GOOD.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read &quot;Consider the Lobster&quot; for the first time last week, my (so far) only exposure to DFW; and so was intrigued title here. 

Shellfish on the whole don&#039;t get a very good deal in the despatching department; boiled, or steamed or shucked alive. And I think fish have it worse, and maybe industrially raised swine have it worse than them. Nasty business.

Your lobster cracker photos remind me of Magritte.]]></description>
