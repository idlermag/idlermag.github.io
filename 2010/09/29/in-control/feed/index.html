Please do! The evolutionary tree I link to seems to claim that the Dreamcast (and thus the XBox) controllers are direct descendants of the Sega line (and also thus probably my neglect). I&#039;d love to see that fleshed out a bit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Gavin, I&#039;m with you.  Thinking back on all those controllers, The Super Nintendo was weird to handle at first, but one could get used to it.  The N64 was also usable, but I think I got a knack for that one because Goldeneye was such an awesome game and I played it so much I just had to figure that controller out.  But the Xbox?  That thing has always thwarted me.  I&#039;ve never liked it.]]></description>

That&#039;s weird, because you were awesome at that Eternal Champions game.  I still have that one, by the way.  We should all get together to play Sega games.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I barely remember even owning the Sega Genesis (I did) let alone the controller!  I had to pull up images of it.  It looks pretty basic and I don&#039;t remember having any trouble with it.  That N64 controller was really only good for shooting games.  Everything else became a bit of a clusterfuck, clumsy fingers fumbling over clumsy fingers.  Like prom night.]]></description>
