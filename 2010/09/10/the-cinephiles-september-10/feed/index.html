					<description><![CDATA[I would totally agree that Hooper&#039;s career has tanked (who wouldn&#039;t agree?), but the whole Poltergeist/Hooper/Spielberg mess has always bothered me. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a masterpiece of terror. Poltergeist is a watered down, commercialized horror movie (if you can call it that). Yes, it sure does have Spielberg&#039;s signature all over it, and that&#039;s precisely why I don&#039;t like it. It feels too safe and comfy...anything but scary. Hooper&#039;s style is completely absent from the film.

Spielberg, on the other hand, should be blamed entirely for the situation. He hired a director, and should have let him direct it. He reminds me of the spoiled kid who has to make sure that the other kids don&#039;t break his toys when they play with them. Just a completely annoying situation.

Spielberg could never create the kind of dread and despair seen in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He doesn&#039;t have the ability to do that, plain and simple.]]></description>

I was reading about &quot;Death Bed&quot; yesterday! Apparently it was shot outside of Detroit.  Patton Oswalt is a big fan and does a bit about it. He speculates on the sequel, &quot;Rape Stove: The Stove That Rapes&quot;]]></description>

I actually found a pretty great little write up on &quot;The Mangler&quot;, so now you don&#039;t have too!  Also, check out  &quot;Death bed: The Bed That Eats&quot;: 

&quot;The bed also snores, leaving viewers to ponder the metaphysical paradox of a bed sleeping on itself. &quot;

					<description><![CDATA[I think the possibility of Tobe Hooper releasing another good film is about as likely as it is unlikely.  I don&#039;t feel like he brings anything in particular to a film.  He&#039;s totally competent, but without much style or personality.  If a good script lands in his lap (the odds are against it) he&#039;ll make a good film out of it.  If not... well, check out the &quot;Masters&quot; of Horror series (the quotations are mine, not Showtime&#039;s : ) )...]]></description>
