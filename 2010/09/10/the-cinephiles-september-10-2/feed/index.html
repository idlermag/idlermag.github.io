I appreciate your input, Alain, but the list isn&#039;t about proving how many foreign films I watch.  That being said, it&#039;s nice that this thread might be a means by which people can discover new films.  I enjoyed Old Boy, but don&#039;t think Min-sik Choi is &quot;larger than life&quot;.  Just my opinion.  And to be fair, I haven&#039;t seen &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot;.  Consider it added to my list.  Thanks, Alain.]]></description>

Ha!  I love it.  Isn&#039;t that line delivered during the balcony scene in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;?  I seem to recall that being the worst scene in the entirety of the prequel trilogy, which is saying something.]]></description>

How about a column on the hilariously stiled dialog in the Star Wars prequels? Or, better yet, real people read the Star Wars prequels scripts aloud to each other. The funniest line: &quot;Hold me like you did on Naboo.&quot;]]></description>

I think I spent my load on that one as well.  We&#039;ll have to agree to disagree about Training Day.

As far as Senator Palpatine goes, I have to assume you&#039;re referring to the prequels and I&#039;m having a hard time imagining anything about those films ending up on a best of list!  You wanna talk about Emperor Palpatine?  Then I might be down.  Wrong decade though : )  Thanks for the comment, Dan.]]></description>
