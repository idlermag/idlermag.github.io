					<description><![CDATA[Hey Jill! Where is my chili???

Just so you know, White Chicken Chili is actually very easy as well.  Just need some chicken... cooked then diced, can of green chilies, can of white northern beans, and vegetables if you&#039;d like them (corn might be good!).  Some onions and garlic etc. You should definitely go for that one next weekend! 

I love reading about Jill&#039;s adventures!]]></description>
