					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2010/12/08/the-strong-weak-man/#comment-602&quot;&gt;gInny&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank you for your thoughts! The interview with Robert De Niro (at least what was selected and shown) in &#039;I Knew It Was You&#039; about the casting process for &#039;The Deer Hunter&#039; is worded in such a way that one infers Cimino to be the opposing factor in Cazale&#039;s participation in the film, especially since no aspect of studio involvement indicated, nor is EMI mentioned. However, it is inexact enough to be non-commital. International Movie Database also cites exactly what you say here. Why the documentary presented an ambiguous stance, or how intentional the ambiguity was, is unclear. Cimino declined to be interviewed for the documentary. This is definitely an interesting aspect of the history. Thanks for the heads-up! :)

					<description><![CDATA[&#039;&#039;Director Michael Cimino was opposed to casting Cazale because his illness made him “un-insurable,” 
NO! It was not him but the producers (EMI). Michael fought for John and If you watch a interview with him on Youtube he curses very much at these people from EMI. He was great guy]]></description>
