					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2010/12/25/1-christmas-music/#comment-691&quot;&gt;Tim Carmody&lt;/a&gt;.

I&#039;m struck by the notes of concern over the holiday in the special. Specifically the threat of over-commercialization. There are elements of that threat in the Easter special, where the gang goes to buy eggs (oh Marcy, you dolt!) and encounters signs everywhere signaling how many days left until Christmas. 

Maybe the theme I&#039;ve been trying to discuss, the feeling of how Christmas USED to be, is not an uncommon or recent development. 

If Charles Schultz and the team behind this special felt that Christmas was becoming too commercial FORTY FIVE years ago what does that say for today?]]></description>
