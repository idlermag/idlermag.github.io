Thanks for reading, BF. The reason I&#039;m keen on comparing RBIs for a guy like Werth is because he is being paid (by the Nats) Cabrera money, but he hasn&#039;t been able to produce what matters most for hitters: RBIs. His fans will point to his OBP, etc, but that&#039;s not a measure of success. You don&#039;t want a guy who just gets on base. You want a guy who hits runners in, and that (along with a low batting average) is the reason Werth is a bust. If you check the other stats, head to head, his numbers aren&#039;t too far off of Cabrera&#039;s.]]></description>
