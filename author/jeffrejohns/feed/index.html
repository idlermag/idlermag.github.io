										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently at a party in which I met a gentleman who tried to convince me that the third <em>Matrix</em> film is the finest of the trilogy. Needless to say, I was aghast and spent the next several minutes arguing against this delusional notion until finally my wife wisely and diplomatically separated me from this poor misguided individual. The conversation got me thinking about how almost everyone I know likes at least two or three widely reviled popular culture creations. There’s the friend who thinks that Guns N’ Roses’s <em>Chinese Democracy</em> was a masterpiece which was well worth the wait. The girl I know that loved <em>Battleship Earth</em> or the guy who doesn’t know why NBC didn’t produce a second season of <em>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</em> (actually, that last person would be me.)</p>
<p>It is surprising that we often feel very strongly about the need to defend and justify our beliefs about these underappreciated cultural works. In doing so we are not only defending the things in question but also our own tastes and in some way our validity as social and cultural commentators. It matters to many of us that our friends and colleagues respect our opinions and understand why we believe what we do. Which is why this column is about my appreciation of <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin, The Boy Wonder</em>. The often-delayed Frank Miller and Jim Lee ten issue series is almost universally despised by both critics and comic book readers alike but I have a strange affinity for the story. Reviewers generally praise Lee’s artwork but despise Miller’s storytelling. I, on the other hand, appreciate both creators’ work, and find that the two mesh together to create something unique and exciting, the likes of which I have never seen. The narrative showcases a nearly psychopathic Batman who seems to be teetering on the brink of sanity as he drags a twelve year old Dick Grayson into his war against crime. There is nothing likable about this Dark Knight, he’s extremely violent, overly profane, masochistic, and bordering on sadistic. He is not a good guy and may not be a hero. He is a deeply troubled man who tortures criminals, kidnaps little boys, seems to be devoid of empathy, and is only concerned about himself. He is a highly unsavory character who displays many of humanity’s worst traits and is a role model for no one. </p>

<p>The logical question to ask at this point is; if this Batman is truly so unpleasant why do I like the story so much? In truth it is because this version of the Dark Knight has little to no redeeming qualities or social value. To my mind this Batman is the logical extension of many of the Caped Crusader’s traits taken to the highest degree. Batman has often been portrayed as disturbed, violent, arrogant, and pompous. These characteristics were soft-pedaled or muted by other more desirable qualities in past stories. This book enhances the Dark Knight’s core self and displays how unbecoming such a hero truly would be. I read it as a commentary on society in a post-September 11th world (the first issue was published in 2005.) The narrative asks the reader to consider what price is he/she willing to pay for security and what amount of freedom is he/she willing to sacrifice in the process. I find the effort to be bold and rather forward thinking. It follows the tradition of Miller’s own <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em> and Alan Moore&#8217;s <em>Watchmen</em> in presenting the negative aspects of superheroes but it does it at an intensity never before seen in a story featuring one of the comic industry’s best known characters. I can understand why some readers are repulsed by the effort but I believe that such feelings are the point of the story. We should be repulsed, the idea that a mentally unstable billionaire dresses as a bat and violently fights crime would bother many of us if these events happened in the real world. I understand that Batman is fantasy and that escapist literature provides an avenue to flee reality for awhile but isn’t Miller’s notion of a maximized Batman something worth considering?</p>
<p>The other reason that I like <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> so much is in many ways the opposite of my above way of thinking. This Batman story takes place in the same universe as Miller’s most notable Batman stories: <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>, <em>Batman: Year One</em>, and <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</em>. When combined these stories create a dense narrative that presents the Dark Knight at the beginning of his career and at the end. This progression is fascinating and allows the reader to see how the Batman from <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> was created and how he changed. It provides insight into numerous plot points and story details that were before unexplored. Miller has created a sinister universe in which not only Batman has become a super-enhanced version of himself but so too have other heroes like Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow. Like Batman, these characters’ core qualities are maintained but are taken to their furthest logical extent. <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> rewards readers that follow along closely and connect the dots from previous stories. The narrative also contains numerous Easter eggs from throughout DC Comics history and encourages the reader to consider Batman’s mythos and how the character has progressed since 1939 when he began as a hardcore vigilante.</p>

<p>So, that’s my overall spiel. I doubt I’ve convinced many of you because I imagine a large number of readers find the story to be too distasteful to stick with and also because I didn’t give any concrete examples from the book. The problem is that I don’t think I have room to fit any good illustrations into this column. To remedy this I am going to use future columns to review individual issues of <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> and give tangible examples of why I think the narrative is so good. Imagine me as the guy at the party who is trying his best to convince you to rethink something you have written off as inferior. Feel free to argue with me, I’d like the input and relish the challenge. Hopefully the hors d&#8217;oeuvres are good, the beer is plentiful, and I don’t have spinach in my teeth.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I pulled into my office parking lot this morning and turned off the car I noticed that the digital dashboard clock showed “6:16.” In my early morning pre-coffee daze my mind registered that 616 is the main Marvel universe’s designation as provided by Alan Moore. I always respected Moore for giving the universe a seemingly random number. It seems egotistical that DC’s central stories would take place on Earth 1 (not to mention that the older characters’ home was somehow designated Earth 2. The Justice Society of America and their descendents should be on Earth 1 out of fairness, logicalness, and respect for one’s elders.) No matter what the worlds are named parallel Earth stories hold a special place in my heart. I love the idea that the existing possibilities are so numerous that we can scarcely imagine them all. There are worlds so strange and unencumbered by continuity than almost anything can happen. Its limitlessness is intoxicating. </p>
<p>Generally when I think of parallel Earths stories I imagine the superhero variety; costumed champions from multiple universes both battling themselves and world conquering villains. My favorite is <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, one the touchstone comic book stories of my childhood. Surprisingly, the best parallel Earths comic book tale that I’ve read in a long time isn’t a superhero narrative. Rather it’s a sad and heartwarming story of multiple lived and outcomes. <em>Daytripper</em> by Fabio Moon and Grabriel Ba isn’t a classic parallel Earths narrative and not just because it doesn’t feature superheroes. Rather, the story probably takes place on only one Earth on which events are shifted in order to display how small actions irrevocably change our lives. The ten issue-length stories have the feel of parallel worlds though, in which things are almost the same but something is slightly different. Here the difference is time and how the passing years change each of us and make us parallel versions of our younger and older selves. The stories provide a commentary on growing older and explore the different eras of a person’s life. Superhero stories are generally juvenile power fantasies that embrace the reader’s need to feel exceptional and value action over thought. In contrast, <em>Daytripper</em> investigates the reality of aging and death and searches for shared human experiences no matter how unpleasant or unsettling they may be. The stories also celebrates the large and small joys of life and relishes the moments that make us human. While superheroes make the extraordinary commonplace, Moon and Ba make the common extraordinary.</p>

<p>The stories are structured non-chronologically, so the reader bounces back and forth through the main character Bras de Oliva Domingos’s life. This effect has been used in numerous novels and films but it still provides discomfort to the reader accustomed to linear storytelling. It allows us to follow events and threads through Bras’s life and see how he and those around him grow, adjust, change, and decline. As with most fiction, the true joy in reading <em>Daytripper</em> is internalizing the narrative and reflecting on one’s own life and the lives of his/her parallel selves. What are the events that could have changed your life and what are the possible parallel realities that were created from such choices? Somewhere is there a you that took that job in London and now lives with a spouse in England? What happened to the 22 year old you that did join the Peace Corps? Or the you that decided that you were sober enough to drink although you’d had six beers? The decisions were endless and so are the possibilities. The latest episode of <em>Community</em> is focusing on the idea of a dark parallel universe, which spun out of an earlier story about choices creating parallel worlds. This most likely is reference to the original <em>Star Trek</em> series episode that features a dark universe version of the Enterprise crew. (I sometimes wonder if my goatee marks me as the dark universe me.) So, seemingly I’m not the only one that finds the idea of parallel lives interesting.</p>
<p>My favorite <em>Daytrippers</em> chapter is one in which a 32 year old Bras struggles to find his way in the world. While working as an obituary writer he attempts to write his first novel during his free time and the words aren’t coming. He struggles to escape from his successful father’s shadow and to free himself from his over-protective mother. I remember the 32 year old me that had many of the same problems. I wish I could visit his parallel world and tell him that everything gets better. Warn him to enjoy his time with his father before he dies. Counsel him to worry less and enjoy things more. Actually, most of that is pretty good advice for me today. Maybe my older self is trying to tell me something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These kids today. As I get older I struggle to not become of those, “these kids today” kinds of people. I worry that I might be becoming a crotchety old man though. You see, I grew up in the 1980s and hold a fondness for the decade and its popular culture. I also remember the how many members of the media in particular and society in general seemed to vilify my Gen X brethren. According to some we were the slackers that would bring ruin to American society, the thirteenth generation of Americans that would undoubtedly prove unlucky for the nation’s future. At the time everyone seemed to worry about us and openly express their displeasure with the Xers. These criticisms were unfair and rather reactionary, saying more about observer than the observed. I don’t want to be one of “those” people but I fear that it could slowly be happening. </p>
<p>I wonder if part of me is a little unfair to the generation that was born after me &#8212; commonly known as the Millennials. During my teaching days I got to know a number of students from the younger generation and one thing that continually confused me was the majority’s seemingly unending need for groupthink, which, in my mind, created a distressing lack of individuality and privacy. I grew up viewing group activities as breeders of laziness and a violation of my personal space. I was raised to believe in self-reliance, individual work, and personal space. Maybe the world has changed and I should fall in line or maybe we should have a conversation about privacy and individuality as a society. No matter what happens I doubt that society will return to how it was during my youth. </p>

<p>When I read Brian K. Vaughan and Marcos Martin’s <em>The Private Eye</em> #1 this week I thought about many of these subjects again. This digital comic book has received a large amount of much-deserved attention since it first appeared last week. For those of you that don’t know, the introductory issue is being sold <a href="http://panelsyndicate.com/" target="_blank">exclusively online</a> for whatever price the buyer wishes to pay and has seemingly been a big hit. While the business model maybe interesting, the story is what is truly important. The tale is a neo-hard-boiled detective narrative set in the year 2076. At some time between now and the start of the tri-centennial the Internet collapsed in such a catastrophic manner that it caused everyone’s information, no matter how private, to become public. This served as a catalyst for a societal swing in which Americans appear to value privacy above all else. Everyone seemingly has a secret identity, the police and the news media have merged into one entity, and the Internet no longer exists. (Interestingly, Los Angles has a subway-like public transportation system, ostensibly a move away from individualism.)</p>

<p>The story is a classic Sam Spade style detective tale with attractive dames, a Dick Tracy inspired police officer with wristwatch communicator accessory, a withdrawn and contemplatively nostalgic gumshoe, and a murderous villain with a secret agenda. The twist is that all of these elements seem new in this bright and colorful future setting. Martin’s artwork is dazzling and jumps off the page like a neon lit Las Vegas night. The artwork and story are much brighter and more inviting than most of the dystopian visions of the future produced during the last 50 years. I’ve been trying to describe the work to my friends and the elevator pitch that I have settled on is the Emerald City from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> meets <em>Blade Runner</em> mixed with Sam Spade plus a large dose of Easy Rawlins. I loved the first issue and can’t wait for the next one to arrive in a month. It’s rare these days that I get excited about a monthly comic book (<em>Saga</em>, <em>The Manhattan Projects</em>, <em>The Walking Dead</em>, and Scott Snyder’s <em>Batman</em> are the other current entries on the list.) I’m anxious to see where the story leads and what Vaughan and Martin have to say about the line between the personal and the public spheres.  </p>
<p>My favorite part of the story is undoubtedly a three page passage in which the main character tries to re-explain society to his senile grandfather. Assuming the older man is around 80 then we can place his birthdate about 1996, or someone that would be approximately 17 years old today. The almost completely bald senior citizen still sports a sleeveless “wifebeater” t-shirt, skinny jeans, and a body full of tattoos. When the reader initially meets the elderly gentleman he is desperately trying to get his iPhone to work although his grandson tells him that it hasn’t functioned for sixty years. The grandfather angrily replies, “I shared as much as I shared ‘cause my life was an open goddamn book. My generation was proud of who we were. We don’t have nothing to hide.” To which the grandson replies, “Yeah. That’s what they all said.” To me this is the heart of the story, the boundary between public and private. The understanding of what is overt and what is secret. Changing cultural mores that leaves one generation behind as another moves forward. As I feel the world moving on I wonder how soon before I will be the grumpy old man.            </p>

<p>Although I strangely identify more with the grandson than the older man closer to my birth year, I still sympathize with the grandfather. Getting older is rough and seeing the world change around you is something that society quite never prepares you for. It’s hard to accept that the world has moved on and you’ve been left behind. I suspect that the future will bring less privacy and more groupthink but I could be wrong. I am happy to know that the coolest new comic book of the year is a retelling of a classic Raymond Chandler like tale. At least these kids today have something decent to read.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession to make; I don’t understand some of Grant Morrison’s stories. What I mean to say is that I usually can follow the plot and generally comprehend the basic narrative but I feel like I’m missing important things within the tales. It seems as if I am only reading the surface and there is so much more below. My geek resume is strong &#8212; I read my first comic book when I was ten years old and I think I have a fairly decent comprehension of the how comic book stories generally work. I understand panel layouts, reoccurring themes and ideas, and have a working knowledge of comic book continuity and history. In other words, I’m a fanboy (albeit a middle-aged one). This means that I&#8217;m generally able to relatively easily process and understand the comic books I read each week. Frankly, many of them are reheating older ideas that I have encountered at least once and probably several times before. Superman loses his powers and has to prove it’s not only his super-abilities that make him a hero. (I’ve read it before.) Spider-Man has to protect the very society that fears and persecutes him. (I’ve seen it many times.) A comic book publisher creates a company-wide crossover that promises to change everything; I’ve invested more money than I can count into these tales and have the issues of <i>Invasion</i>, <i>Zero Hour</i>, and <i>House of M</i> to prove it.</p>
<p>Since I believe I know most, if not all, of the comic book tropes, it bothers me when I find something that I can’t completely wrap my head around. Some of Grant Morrison’s stories do this to me. <i>The Invisibles</i> &#8212; I’m still trying to grasp many of the stories’ imbedded concepts. <i>Arkham Asylum</i> &#8212; I think I understand it but then I wonder if I’m missing something. <i>Final Crisis</i> &#8212; don’t even get me started on this one. This confounds me because <i>All-Star Superman</i> and Morrison’s <i>Doom Patrol</i> are two of my favorite comic book runs ever. It irritates me that I can’t completely follow all of Morrison’s storytelling, especially since I agree with him that narrative is a powerful force that is widely underappreciated.</p>

<p>The other reason that I would like to better follow all of Morrison’s references and motivations is he wrote a comic book story that to this day still deeply resonates with me. It’s <i>Animal Man</i> #5, “The Coyote Gospel,&#8221; a heartbreaking tale of heroism and loss, the like of which rarely finds its way into superhero comics. The story features a Wile E. Coyote stand-in named Crafty (get it?) who serves as the story’s messianic figure. If you start with the elevator pitch of “Wile E. Coyote is Christ” you’ve already got a bizarre and amazing idea but Morrison adds heroism and sorrow to the mix. He somehow makes the reader care about the coyote savior while at the same time making us question ourselves and the world around us. A pretty mean feat for a “funny book” about a guy who received animal powers from aliens.</p>
<p>In “The Coyote Gospel,” Crafty comes from a Warner Brothers-like cartoon world where life is poor, nasty, brutish, and long. The land’s animated denizens are continually battling each other with Acme-type weapons and cartoonish methods. This causes only pain and strife though none of the cartoons question their lives. One day Crafty rebels against this system of violence and appears before his god. Appropriately, Crafty’s god is the artist who created him and presumably writes and draws the coyote’s adventures. The creator sends Crafty into the comic book version of the reader’s world and declares that the cartoon coyote has been sentenced to Hell. As long as Crafty suffers in this other existence the creator promises to allow peace to flourish in the cartoon world. Crafty is given a new body and suffers pain and humiliation again and again but he seemingly cannot die. The former cartoon coyote agonizes so his people (read animals) will not. He bears his world’s pain and sacrifices himself in order to fight misery and injustice. In the end, a conservative Christian, who believes that he is slaying the devil, kills Crafty. The coyote cries as he holds a crucifixion pose and dies in the middle of a four-way intersection, which looks suspiciously like a cross. The story ends with a giant hand using a huge paintbrush to fill in the artistic details. The artist god has killed Crafty and the pact that kept the animal’s world safe is now broken.</p>

<p>I read this story about once a year and it always manages to touch me and force me to ponder life, death, selflessness, and the nature of God. Not bad for a comic book tale featuring a Wile E. Coyote look-alike and a yellow and orange clad superhero. Maybe I want too much but I wonder if more of Morrison’s stories could touch me this way if I better understood them. <i>All-Star Superman </i>did. I reveled in connecting the dots between <i>DC One Million </i>and the twelve issue series. I loved the numerous winks to Silver Age stories and issue number six broke my heart. This makes me ponder if I should work harder to understand Morrison’s writing and do the necessary research to better connect with the author. Something about that idea leaves me cold though. If I have to studying in order to understanding Morrison’s work, will the benefit be the same? Will I feel it as deeply as I do with <i>Animal Man</i> #5? Maybe sometimes our histories and interests coincide with an author’s imagination and we cannot force this connection. Perhaps, it is something unique when a writer and a reader share a narrative bond and these moments should be treasured for their rarity. I probably will never completely understand Grant Morrison’s stories but maybe that’s a good thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a longstanding observation, which contends that writers are thieves and liars who steal stories from their daily lives and lie about the details. While this reflection is comical in nature, at its heart is a kernel of truth. Each of us &#8212; not only writers &#8212; is a storyteller who steals tales from the world and often fudges the facts, just a little, in the retelling. Don’t think you’re a storyteller? Ever post on Facebook? Compose tweets on Twitter? Send text messages? Talk to someone in person or on the telephone? If so, you’re a storyteller. In fact, it’s hard to image someone who, at some point in his or her day, does not relay some sort of information in a narrative form.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because we listen to and tell so many stories throughout our lives we are all experts on the format and rules of storytelling. We know the tricks to build suspense, to encourage audience support, and provoke an emotional reaction. We understand the complex word choices and delicate thematic structures inherent in every kind of story. (i.e. the cheating husband who fails the DNA test on <em>Maury</em> needs to look contrite and sound defeated, whilst the newest Bond villain should have a foreign accent, a physical defect, and hopefully a lap cat.) </p>
<p>Paradoxically, in a world filled with stories and storytellers there are no new stories. Unquestionably, we create millions, if not billions, of different stories every day, but each of these tales is just a refurbished version of an older narrative. There are no new kinds of stories only new understandings of classic plots. Don’t believe me? Think about it. When was the last time heard, read, or watched a tale that was unlike anything you had seen before? You probably haven’t had that experience since you were a child. Amazingly, though each of us knows the basic types of stories (romance, war, revenge, quest, etc.), we constantly crave new accounts of the accepted standards. On a basic, almost primal level, we, as human beings, need to constantly give and receive more stories. </p>
<p>That brings me to the comic book series <em>Saga</em> by Brian K. Vaughn and Fiona Staples. On its face there is nothing new about <em>Saga</em>. It’s a space opera epic that features a young couple in love on the run, bickering in-laws, a bounty hunter, and an ongoing war. It’s <em>Star Wars</em> meets <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> with a dash of <em>The Terminator</em> thrown in for good measure. Thematically and structurally there is nothing new in <em>Saga</em>, and that’s why it’s so incredibly good. The simple truth is that Vaughn and Staples create an exceptional tale about extra-terrestrial characters that in no way seem alien. The reader knows the characters, understands what they need and how they feel, roots for or against them, and patiently waits every month to read more about their lives. Vaughn and Staples do what all good storytellers do, they makes us care about what happens on the next page.  </p>

<p><em>Saga</em> is narrated by Hazel, who is a newborn within the story’s confides but seemingly an adult during the future retelling. (This voice-over flashback style that has been used before in the movie <em>A Christmas Story</em> and the TV shows <em>The Wonder Years</em> and <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> also works well here.) Hazel tells the reader the story of her newly married young parents Alana and Marko &#8212;  star-crossed lovers whose species are at war with one another. Alana and Marko are clearly in over their heads; not only are they wanted suspects being chased by bounty hunters and royalty family members, they also are naïve parents and a newlywed couple who are still trying to adjust to their new living arrangement. They are tired, scared, stressed, and often utterly clueless, and in remarkable storytelling fashion their love almost permeates the page. Anyone who has left home, gotten married, had a baby, started a new career, or done a thousand other things that has made him or her feel vulnerable and more than a little uncomfortable will identify with Alana and Marko. Anyone who has ever been in love will understand the couple’s bond and will feel the terrifying helplessness of knowing that you cannot protect someone who you care about more than yourself. Alana may have wings and Marko ram-like horns but the two are the most human characters in comic book stories in recent memory. </p>
<p>One of many example of <em>Saga</em>’s storytelling power is found in the tale’s first few pages. The story opens with Alana giving birth to Hazel and Marko trying to help. Hazel’s future narration is scribbled on the page and stands in contrast to Staples&#8217;s beautifully expressive art. Hazel opines, “This is how an idea becomes real. But ideas are fragile things. Most don’t live long outside of the ether from which they were pulled, kicking and screaming. That’s why people create with someone else. Two minds can sometimes improve the odds of an idea’s survival. . . but there are no guarantees.” Here Vaughan is commenting on childbirth, storytelling, he and Staples&#8217;s new undertaking, and probably a dozen other things. While Hazel (and Vaughn) are commenting on high-minded ideas, Alana is giving birth and providing the following earthy comments to Marko, “Am I shitting? It feels like I’m shitting! Seriously, you’ll never have sex with me again if I defecate all over you. Unless you’re secretly into that. Please don’t be into that.”  After Marko tells her that she is beautiful Alana replies, “Right, because nothing’s more lovely than a fat woman spread-eagle in the back of an old body shop. It’s like something out of a fairy tale.” (By the way, do you see what Vaughn’s doing here,? Having a woman with small wings on her back meta-textually commenting on fairy tale narrative whilst she, herself, is essentially in a fairy tale.)</p>

<p>Needless to say, <em>Saga</em> is something special. I haven’t even discussed the other characters. The Will, the violent and yet moral bounty hunter who is pursuing Alana and Marko. Prince Robot IV, a television-headed member of a royal family. There’s also a Lying Cat, a ghost babysitter, a naked giant, and a visit from Marko’s parents. All of this comes together to create a narrative that uses the structure of what has come before to comment on both the medium and our lives. More importantly it’s a great story. It draws the reader in and makes one angry that he or she has to wait another month for the next edition. There is little new about <em>Saga</em> but that’s why it’s the best comic book I read every month.     </p>
