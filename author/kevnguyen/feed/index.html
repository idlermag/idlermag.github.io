										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a friend that claims you can never love a book unless you read it for pleasure &#8212; &#8220;The right book at the right time,&#8221; he says. But I think it&#8217;s easy to appreciate the right book at the wrong time too. It’s certainly easier to love a book read at one&#8217;s own leisure, but even at my job, where I am lucky enough to <em>have</em> to read two or three books a week, I&#8217;ve found that I can still appreciate a novel even when I’m speeding through it to meet a deadline.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say the same for videogames, which is, to me, one of the ways it&#8217;s a medium distinct from books, albums, and movies.  <em>Cave Story</em> is short by game standards &#8212; 6 to 8 hours of play &#8212; but with lots of work-related travel over the past month, I&#8217;ve struggled to keep up with Daniel and Gavin. Last week, I had &#8220;beat  <em>Cave Story</em>&#8221; on my to-do list, underneath &#8220;fold laundry&#8221; and &#8220;clean disgusting fridge.&#8221; (Needless to say, I did my laundry and cleaned out my fridge first.) It&#8217;s easy to power through a book by giving it all of your focus and attention because there are a finite number of pages. With videogames, there are a set number of levels, sure, but an infinite number of movements. One’s interactions constitute &#8220;playing,&#8221; and  <em>Cave Story</em> beckons to be explored. Yet I simply blew right through the game, feeling frustrated every time I had to backtrack and trying skip as much dialogue as I could, all the while recognizing that I wasn&#8217;t giving  <em>Cave Story</em> the attention it deserved. When Curly Brace sacrifies herself, I really didn&#8217;t care. I barely remembered who she was.</p>
<p>Having read Gavin&#8217;s <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/13/cave-story-choices-matter-in-the-end/">extraordinarily thoughtful post on the narrative&#8217;s emotional resonance</a>, I found myself wondering why I didn&#8217;t get the same satisfaction out of  <em>Cave Story</em>. I often beat games as quickly as possible &#8212; most recently <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, so I could see what all the hubbub was about with the ending &#8212; but <em>Cave Story</em> feels different. Perhaps it&#8217;s the kind of delightful game that doesn&#8217;t need to be completed so much as savored. It&#8217;s designed to give the player a lingering sense of wonderment and nostalgia. In my haste, I only picked up on hints of this feeling throughout the game. The only true nostalgia I felt was a longing for a time in my life when I had all the hours in the world to play videogames.</p>
<p>Or better put: For me, right now, <em>Cave Story</em> is the right game at the wrong time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to admit that I am way behind <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/22/cave-story-power-up/">Daniel</a> and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/23/cave-story-the-zig-zag-world/">Gavin</a> in my playthrough of <em>Cave Story</em> because I have been clocking a lot of hours into <em>Diablo III</em>, which actually makes for an interesting comparison.</p>
<p>Like <em>Cave Story</em>, <em>Diablo III</em> is a game that panders to one&#8217;s nostalgia, in this case nostalgia for <em>Diablo II</em>, released way back in 2000. I remember coming home from summer camp and pouring all of my time into accumulating new weapons and armor for my Amazon. The point of the Diablo games isn&#8217;t to defeat monsters; it&#8217;s to collect more stuff, which is good for helping you collect more stuff. <em>Diablo III</em> is certainly a vast improvement upon its predecessor, but overall, it&#8217;s really the same game built for 2013. I won&#8217;t say too much more about Diablo, since I&#8217;m supposed to be talking about <em>Cave Story</em>, but basically <em>Diablo III</em> has all the talent and polish of a triple-A title. And for those reasons, it basically has no heart.</p>
<p>Few games have more heart than <em>Cave Story</em>. It was painstakingly hand-crafted (so to speak) by Daisuke Amaya, who designed and developed the game by himself over the course of five years. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://blogs.vandal.net/12458/vm/13302725112007" target="_blank">decent interview</a> with Amaya, where he explains that his work on the game paralleled his life: &#8220;At the time I started work on <em>Cave Story</em>, I was a student, but now I&#8217;m an office worker. My entire life had changed by the time this game was finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right: Amaya is not a game developer by trade, so he created the art, music, and story, as well as all the code, in his free time. It may be a nostalgic platformer, but <em>Cave Story</em> feels like the personal expression of one man. We all love the game&#8217;s weirdness (or in Daniel&#8217;s words, the <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/15/cave-story-lets-get-retro/">&#8220;WTF factor&#8221;</a>), which is something that can only come from the vision and imagination of singular vision.</p>
<p>So why am I not compelled to play more <em>Cave Story</em>? </p>
<p>For me, the appeal of <em>Cave Story</em> is its charm. Sure, it&#8217;s fun to jump around and fire rockets, but I love uncovering the uniqueness buried beneath the <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Castlevania</em>-inspired platforming. <em>Diablo</em>, on the other hand, is designed to be addictive. And it is very good at that, almost to the point of blandness. The game says and means nothing.</p>
<p>While both are designed to make you think about the good old days, I think there&#8217;s a single key difference between the two games: <em>Cave Story</em> celebrates nostalgia, while <em>Diablo III</em> exploits it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me, platformers have always been nostalgic. Sure, my first videogame console was an NES with <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, but I was too young in those days to have a valuable opinion about it (I know this because my favorite NES game, at the time, was <em>Batman Returns</em>). The first game that made a true impression on me was <em>Super Mario 64</em>. It was also the first game I really immersed myself in and played thoughtfully. All that to say, I belong more closely to the first generation of 3D games than I do the Golden Age of 2D cartridges.</p>
<p>In contrast to Dan (who I believe is about 100 years old), by the time I was in high school and college, platformers were already nostalgic. Now that I think about it, I&#8217;ve played through more side-scrollers using an emulator than on an actual console.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s <em>Cave Story</em>, which I am playing on my Mac (it&#8217;s only $9.99 on Steam), a platformer designed deliberately to evoke nostalgia. The Kool-Aid Man reference, as Dan pointed out, is a great example of <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s bizarre sense of humor and its playful self-winking. I&#8217;m not much further than the Balrog &#8212; ostensibly the first boss &#8212; but I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s just the first of many nerdy inside jokes. And I&#8217;m looking forward to them all!</p>
<p>One thing that bugs me is that the physics of <em>Cave Story</em> seem a little off. The jumps feel sort of loose, almost floaty. Of course, platformers don&#8217;t have to adhere to Earth&#8217;s physics, but it has to feel like there&#8217;s sort of predictable gravity. When I jump I want to know where I&#8217;ll land.</p>
<p>I have a friend who has this theory that the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> has the perfect platformer physics. I believe that. There&#8217;s something natural and predictable about the way Mario jumps. Is it because Miyamoto engineered the jump perfectly, or because <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> defined what that perfect jump is supposed to feel like? I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;ve seen people who don&#8217;t play video games give a spectacular run through <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> for that reason.</p>
<p>Outside of pure nostalgia, I think that&#8217;s the ultimate appeal of platformers today. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to teach someone all the buttons to play <em>Halo</em>, you realize just how complicated games have become. Platformers have a familiar linearity to them. <em>Cave Story</em> is a largely two-button game, and I find its simplicity comforting and endearing. So while I&#8217;m charmed by <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s idiosyncracies, I&#8217;m waiting to fall in love with its mechanics.</p>
