										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me.</em></p>
<p>&#8212; Christopher Nolan</p></blockquote>
<p>I saw <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> approximately 24 hours after the tragedy that occurred in Aurora, Colorado. I didn’t think twice when I purchased the tickets, even though I had heard about it all the way to work that Friday morning. It wasn’t until a security guard entered the theatre right after the house lights had dimmed and checked the emergency exits that I found my eyes and mind wandering. I scanned those same exits. I looked at the folks around me, especially those who had gotten up to leave. Returning with no concessions or evidence of purpose only sent my imagination off. I had to decide whether or not person X was likely to commit a violent act. Surely that old man here with his wife wouldn’t brandish a weapon? That group of guys? That mother of three?</p>
<p>Part of me was embarrassed that any of it had even crossed my mind. Aurora&#8217;s Cinema 16 security was not prepared for such a random act of violence precisely because it was unthinkable. To my knowledge, nothing like it had ever happened before. The last time I can recall any violence linked to a movie screening was in the early 90’s after the release of <em>New Jack City</em>. I confess to being ignorant as to whether or not any gun violence actually took place (mostly fights, if memory serves), but I feel confident in saying that no one was shot IN a theatre, and certainly not over 50 people. But yes, it has happened now and we tell ourselves we must do something so it can never happen again.</p>
<p>But we do not live in the world of <em>Minority Report</em>. We can&#8217;t predict individual acts of violence. We can only <em>react</em>. There isn’t a place we can go that will be completely and absolutely safe, but there are places where violence is far less likely to occur. The movie theatre should be one of them. I believe that it still is.</p>
<p>Time will tell, of course. This appears, so far, to have been the act of a lone and probably unbalanced individual. There will always be crazies. There will always be acts of random violence in public places. Are we to live in fear? Are we to walk out of our front doors every day expecting the worst? Of course not. But we feel the need to react. There must be something, anything that can be done.</p>
<p>I must admit to being pleased that the result hasn&#8217;t been a return to the argument that the film itself was responsible for inciting violence. We know that to be at best a gross oversimplification. Films themselves are reactions to the human experience. They hold up a mirror. It may be wiser to look at America’s appetite for violence. Violent films are made because they make money. A violent culture, or at least a culture with a taste for consuming violent images, leads to violent films, not the other way around.</p>
<p>There were more than a few scenes in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> that made my wife shield her eyes, all involving guns. I looked for her reaction because I was affected as well. But I did settle a bit as the film continued. I cannot pinpoint when, specifically, but I know that I eventually did what I had come to do &#8212; I watched a movie. And though the Aurora tragedy never fully left my mind, I was able to push it into the background. My hope is that in the future other moviegoers will be able to do the same, their fear dimming with the theatre lights, not forgotten, but not triumphant either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Sometimes to even live is an act of courage.<br />
&#8212; Seneca</p></blockquote>
<p>The survival instinct is an interesting one. In the most extreme of circumstances &#8212; that is, in its purest form &#8212; it is without logic. It is animal. Survive to survive, and for no other reason. In Joe Carnahan’s <em>The Grey</em>, seven men are tested. Their circumstances are most certainly extreme, and along the way a few of these men opt out on their own terms. Most are not so lucky. One is not so resigned.</p>
<p>When we first see Ottway (played with a quiet intensity that can only describe as &#8220;Neeson-esque&#8221; by one, Mr. Liam Neeson) he has a gun in his mouth. The look in his eye implies that his mind and body are not operating within the same space. He is thinking of his wife. She tells him not to be afraid. Later, surrounded by the sounds of growling wolves, he tells one of his fellow plane crash survivors that they’d be a fool not to be afraid. But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Grey poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/topwalls.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/The-Grey-movie-600x767.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="460" /> Ottway works at a remote oil outpost with a decent-sized group of men and women he describes as being “unfit” for society. His job is to protect these people by keeping the wolves surrounding the area at bay, perched atop a building with no company other than his sniper rifle. Left alone with his thoughts, he seems to suffer from the kind of internalized social bluntness that comes with that sort of job, an outcast amongst outcasts. None of that matters when the plane goes down.</p>
<p>Soon, the seven survivors find their scheduled leave promptly unscheduled as they awaken in a snow-covered haze. It is here in the wild, cold and hopeless, that Ottway springs into action. First, he guides a man towards death. He tells him “not to be afraid.” He tells him to “let it wash over him.” He describes the process as though he’s been there before. He then moves on to surveying their surroundings. It turns out that they’re full of hungry, aggressive wolves. As if matters needed to be made worse?</p>
<p>The men follow him because he seems to know what he’s doing, and he does, if only to a certain degree. He is familiar with wolf behavior, but mostly in theory. Besides, it is not his wolf expertise that makes him the <em>de facto</em> leader; it is his relentless desire to survive. And while the men cling to home and the things that they stand to lose, Ottway seems to want to survive only to prove to himself that he can.</p>
<p>The group is inevitably thinned. One by one they go, victims of the weather, the wolves and their own hopelessness. Along the way we learn just enough about them to feel sad about it, but not enough to linger for too long.</p>
<p>Then, there is the matter of the wolves.</p>
<p>Sometimes they look good, sometimes not so much. They are mostly, if not all, CG. An interesting choice, especially in context of the primary complaint that I’ve seen lodged against this film: The wolves do not behave like real wolves. Perhaps they are not supposed to? Maybe they are not meant to be “real” wolves? Maybe they are merely the cold, unrelenting representation of nature’s indifference? Maybe it was just cheaper to use CG wolves? Either way, they are most effective when growling just off-camera, their eyes glowing hungrily in the dark. And Carnahan is wise to frame many shots with just enough negative space to make us think that at any moment it could be occupied by one of the leaping, ravenous beasts. We have been trained by monster movies.</p>
<p>In the end it is Ottway, alone. No surprise. Early on in the film he insists that the men gather the wallets of the fallen for the families, like dog tags. Now, sitting on the forest floor he removes them from his backpack, one by one, and stacks them nearly on top of each other. He remembers his wife lying in a hospital bed. “Don’t be afraid.” He remembers a poem his father had framed in his childhood home:</p>
<blockquote><p> Once more into the fray, into the last fight I’ll ever know. Live or die on this day. Live or die on this day.</p></blockquote>
<p>As he glances around him and sees the piles of antlers and various bones he realizes that he has wandered into the wolves&#8217; den. The alpha wolf walks towards him. He gathers himself up, straps weapons to his hands, and lunges forward. Some will be frustrated by the black screen that follows that moment. Others will not. There is a short scene after the credits have finished rolling that may or may not provide satisfaction. For me, it’s completely unnecessary because one can only fight for so long, and the fight is the whole point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>We can allow satellites, planets, suns, universe, nay whole systems of universe, to be governed by laws, but the smallest insect, we wish to be created at once by special act.</p>
<p>&#8212; Charles Darwin</p></blockquote>
<p>If I had a dime for every time I’ve watched <em>Aliens</em> (1986) I’d have, well, a lot of dimes. It remains a staple of my childhood, when I had an army of <em>G.I. Joe</em> action figures and <em>Star Wars</em> spaceships, which I used almost exclusively to play <em>Aliens</em>. Recently, I even sat through it on Syfy, commercial interruptions and curse word cover-ups be damned.</p>
<p>As I grew older I began to gravitate more towards the original film in the series, <em>Alien</em> (1979), which is a psycho-sexual horror film masquerading as science fiction. I responded more to the slow burn, the anguish of knowing that <em>it</em> was coming, but not when. <em>Alien</em> uses shadows similar to the way another great monster film (1975&#8217;s <em>Jaws</em>) uses water &#8212; to help disguise the fundamental flaws of the creature FX while simultaneously forcing the filmmaker to be more creative when deciding how and when to reveal the monster itself.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I saw the transport ship Nostromo touch down on a remote planet in response to an S.O.S. signal, only to find a giant humanoid alien with a hole in its chest. I remember wondering, “Who <em>is</em> that thing? Where did he come from? What’s <em>he</em> all about?” That was right before I was interrupted by the film&#8217;s actual, kick-ass story full of terror, fantastic sets, innovative creature design and rock-solid acting. So yeah, after the initial reveal, I didn’t give two shits about that giant humanoid alien. It appears as though I’m in the minority, though, as <em>Prometheus</em> (2012), <em>Alien</em>’s quasi-prequel, opened last weekend and purports to explain said alien’s origins as well as a whole slew of other things. (Like, the origins of man, for example. You know, nothing major.)</p>
<p>It shouldn’t surprise me that its connections to the <em>Alien</em> series are mostly superfluous. As previously stated, I couldn’t care less about the fan-named “space jockey” at the beginning of <em>Alien</em>. I had always assumed that it was just a remnant of whatever species had occupied that planet before being collectively chest-busted by our parasitic friends. It turns out that this “space jockey,” &#8212; now re-named “engineer” &#8212; may have been involved in the very creation of all that we know and all that we are. Oh, and they may have accidentally created the parasitic race of aliens I have grown up loving, as well. You wanna make an omelet? You know what that involves.</p>
<p>That isn’t the only connection between the films, though. There are smatterings of the original films’ production design everywhere and the company funding the expedition, Weyland-Yutani, is the same company Ripley later works for. . . twice. Here’s the thing: none of it really matters. Not in context of <em>Prometheus</em>, at least.</p>
<p>What we have in <em>Prometheus</em> is two films struggling against each other. One of those films &#8212; the one about a possible explanation for man’s existence via some sort of directed panspermia &#8212; is pretty fascinating and unique. The other is an alien monster film, which has already been executed with such expert precision as to have invented its own subgenre. While the first half of the film puts forth a series of interesting ideas, the later eschews them in favor of more traditional faire.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the biggest problem. While no one in their right mind would argue that any of the <em>Alien</em> films is a character study (<em>Alien3</em> probably comes closest and people HATE that one. I’m not one of those people, for the record), those scripts at least allowed us to spend a decent enough amount of time with everyone to feel <em>something</em> for them. Once <em>Prometheus</em> gets rolling it hardly takes a breath. Remember all of those scientists who had all of those big questions? They can’t talk about them right now because their faces are melting. Or an alien is slithering out of their mouth. Or they’re mutating. Or self-performing a c-section! Yeah, that happens.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to make it seem as though <em>Prometheus</em> is completely without merit, so I suppose I should start mentioning something resembling a good quality? Well, everyone’s mentioned it already, but I’ll jump onto the bandwagon: <em>Prometheus</em> is a beautiful film. The intro, which involves one of the “engineers” ingesting some black, gooey genetic material, only to completely break down and disperse DNA identical to our own into an unnamed planet&#8217;s water supply, is visually stunning. And Michael Fassbender’s performance as “David,” the ship&#8217;s android, is fantastic and deeply unsettling.</p>
<p>I think that a solid argument could be made that <em>Prometheus</em> would have been better off having nothing to do with <em>Alien</em> in the first place. It will be interesting to see what happens in the inevitable sequel. The last surviving character is traveling in space in search of the “engineer’s” origin. (The old “who made the watchmaker” argument.) What we’re left with is a largely barren planet infested with parasitic aliens. How, exactly, did <em>Prometheus</em> have any real effect on what’s to come?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always been picky about when to buy and when not to buy a copy of a film. In the days before Netflix streaming, before Redbox and OnDemand, I would be so bold as to pick up a bargain bin film that I had never seen, but looked interesting. I am so old as to admit that that bargain bin film was probably on VHS, at least in the early goings. I lined my shelves. I bought previously-viewed films from the likes of Blockbuster and, showing my age even more, Mammoth video. Not only did I need to see everything, but I needed to display what I had seen like trophies.</p>
<p>Those days are long gone. Not solely because of the aforementioned home viewing options, but because I no longer have anything to prove. Recently, my wife even convinced me to put some of my DVDs away. Like, actually away. As in no longer in the line of sight. Growth is hard; growth is good.  My wife’s insistence that I stop burdening <em>all</em> of our living room shelves with my nerdom notwithstanding, I continued to purchase films, but with much more discernment. Instead of grabbing anything (and everything) I could, I made a point of only picking up films that inspired me, films with legitimate replay value, even if only in part. (I have been known to throw in a film just to watch one scene.) This new approach has made for a smaller, more purposeful collection. It’s also served to highlight my now seemingly archaic need to have something physical to reference.</p>
<p>In the age of streaming films and E-readers I still have shelves lined with DVDs and books. I had an easier time, I think, transitioning to an exclusively digital music collection because of my desire to have music with me at all times. CDs are cumbersome, an iPod is not. It’s been harder to make the transition elsewhere because, at least for me, the experience is as important as the thing itself. Books have a smell, a texture. In the completion of a page there is progress and physical evidence of it. I love bookstores. Love them. I could spend hours wandering the aisles of one, and have. Honestly, an E-reader just lacks character.</p>
<p>The same is true of film. Watching a movie that you chose (or in my case, settled on, watching only the first few minutes before wondering if I’d made a mistake, then choosing to give up on the idea all together) from an online menu isn’t anything. Busting out a copy of <em>Magnolia</em> intending to display and share in its brilliance, but instead ruining a party? Now that’s something. Going to a theatre? Now that’s even something-er. That’s an event. Even going to one of those dinosaur video rental places has got more going for it. At least you got off of the couch.</p>
<p>So I still have a ton of DVDs that I can’t yet bear to part with, even though some of them could surely go. I don’t really need an excuse to be lazy. I should get up and go to the movies, right? When I was a kid we used to walk ten miles through fifty feet of snow just to see a movie! Sometimes I feel old. Other times I worry that convenience will do away with the theatre experience the way that digital music has destroyed the album.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like <em>High Fidelity&#8217;s</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0146882/" target="_blank">Rob Gordon</a>, I love a good Top-whatever list. If there is anything more exciting than itemizing your preferences in any particular category it’s the debate that’s sure to follow. Yes, I am aware of that sentence&#8217;s high nerd factor.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Top 3 nerdy things I’ve said/written today</strong></p>
<p><em>1) “If there is anything more exciting than itemizing your preferences in any particular category it’s the debate that’s sure to follow.”</em></p>
<p><em>2) “I love a good list.”</em></p>
<p><em>3) “Tyrion Lannister is Willow’s superior in every way.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been terribly interested in a list constructed in order of importance, but I find them, overall, to be fine ways to share, especially within the realm of pop culture. Roger Ebert, it seems, is <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2012/04/post_5.html" target="_blank">not so fond of lists</a>. Well, most lists. He does mention a certain, mostly nostalgic affection for <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/history/" target="_blank">Sight &amp; Sound magazine’s <em>Greatest films of all-time</em></a> list, for which many critics, directors, writers and scholars are polled every ten years. That’s about as legit as a pop culture list can get. But Ebert’s argument that lists are mostly filler is surely a vocational one. When it comes to mainstream publications (Hello, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/0,28757,2058946,00.html" target="_blank">Time Magazine</a>), lists do to tend to be largely fluff.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Top 5 weird Top 10 lists that I’ve dug up today</strong></p>
<p><em>1) <a href="http://www.weirdlyodd.com/10-craziest-concepts-by-mad-scientists/" target="_blank">Top 10 Craziest Concepts by Mad Scientists </a></em></p>
<p><em>2) <a href="http://totallytop10.com/comedy/top-10-worst-celebrity-nose-jobs-bad-nose-surgery" target="_blank">Top 10 Worst Celebrity nose jobs</a></em></p>
<p><em>3) <a href="http://thelistcafe.com/10-really-weird-vending-machines" target="_blank">10 Weird vending machines</a></em></p>
<p><em>4) <a href="http://loanpk.com/top-ten-lists-of-people-with-weird-qualities.html/" target="_blank">Top 10 list of people with weird qualities</a></em></p>
<p><em>5) <a href="http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-weird-colors.php" target="_blank">Top 10 weirdest colors you’ve never heard of</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>I could go on and on, but let’s not lose focus. I&#8217;ve got my own fluff to get to.</p>
<p>Shortly after reading Ebert’s piece I took a look at the 2002 <em>Greatest Films</em> list (They don’t have 2012’s up yet), broken down by voter category:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Critics&#8217; top 10 films of all time</strong></p>
<p>1) Citizen Kane (Welles)</p>
<p>2) Vertigo (Hitchcock)</p>
<p>3) La Regle du jeu (Renoir)</p>
<p>4) The Godfather &amp; The Godfather pt. 2 (Coppola)</p>
<p>5) Tokyo Story (Ozu)</p>
<p>6) 2001: A Space Odyssey (Kubrick)</p>
<p>7) Battleship Potemkin (Eisenstein)</p>
<p>8) Sunrise (Murnau)</p>
<p>9) 8 ½ (Fellini)</p>
<p>10) Singin’ in the Rain (Kelly, Donen)</p>
<p><strong>Directors&#8217; top 10 films of all time</strong></p>
<p>1) Citizen Kane</p>
<p>2) The Godfather &amp; The Godfather pt. 2</p>
<p>3) 8 ½</p>
<p>4) Lawrence of Arabia (Lean)</p>
<p>5) Dr. Strangelove (Kubrick)</p>
<p>6) Bicycle Thieves (De Sica)</p>
<p>7) Raging Bull (Scorsese)</p>
<p>8) Vertigo</p>
<p>9) Rashomon (Kurosawa)</p>
<p>10) La Regle du jeu</p>
<p>11) Seven Samurai (Kurosawa)</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are 11 films listed in that Top 10. That&#8217;s because there was a three way tie for 6 and 9 and I couldn&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<p>Forgetting that all of these films are certainly worthy of being at least considered &#8220;great films&#8221; (&#8220;Greatest of all time&#8221; is a bit grandiose for me), when considering its source, how interesting is a list like this, really? As stated, Ebert pays attention to it mostly because he always has. But isn&#8217;t it far more interesting to get a subjective list from someone specific you admire rather than a respected panel? To me, the answer is yes.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Roger Ebert&#8217;s votes for greatest films of all time</strong></p>
<p>1) Aguirre, Wrath of God (Herzog)</p>
<p>2) Apocolypse Now (Coppola)</p>
<p>3) Citizen Kane</p>
<p>4) Dekalog (Kieslowski)</p>
<p>5) La dolce vita (Fellini)</p>
<p>6) The General (Keaton)</p>
<p>7) Raging Bull</p>
<p>8) 2001: A Space Odyssey</p>
<p>9) Tokyo Story</p>
<p>10) Vertigo</p></blockquote>
<p>I find Ebert&#8217;s opinion to be enlightening, even when we aren&#8217;t in total agreement, and I am far more apt to find use in a list from him because of that. Instead of compiling a list from multiple film makers I would much rather see lists from some of my favorites because it might provide insight into where they&#8217;re coming from artistically as well as expand my own horizons. As a matter of fact, I&#8217;d rather see a top 10 list from a really good, smart friend. It&#8217;s even better when the listmaker knows you and can make recommend specific to you!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list I compiled for a friend recently when she requested 10 must-see films from me:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Beginners (Mills)</p>
<p>2) The Royal Tennenbaums (Anderson)</p>
<p>3) The Proposition (Hillcoat)</p>
<p>4) Mon Oncle (Tati)</p>
<p>5) Once (Carney)</p>
<p>6) McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller (Altman)</p>
<p>7) L&#8217;Enfant (Dardenne)</p>
<p>8) Paris, Texas (Wenders)</p>
<p>9) City Lights (Chaplin)</p>
<p>10) Miller&#8217;s Crossing (Coen)</p></blockquote>
<p>If pressed, I might put a few of these flicks on a &#8220;Greatest films&#8221; list, but I&#8217;d have to be pressed pretty hard to make a &#8220;Greatest films of all time&#8221; list anyways. The subjectivity of art makes that difficult for me, and I&#8217;m not just talking about taste. I&#8217;m talking about emotion. That list is for that friend, specifically, because I believe these particular films will impact her one way or another. There&#8217;s no better reason to make a list than to share experience.</p>
<p>That being said, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a good piece of fluff either. Like, say, an article about lists that&#8217;s full of lists? How meta is that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Netflix Heart" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.techjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/netflixheart.jpg" alt="" width="417" height="323" />Netflix streaming seemed like a dream come true &#8212; thousands of titles instantly accessible, right at my fingertips. Sure, I read the complaints regarding Netflix’s lack of “quality” content, but my tastes are far-reaching and I never had any real trouble finding something worth exploring. Streaming was particularly helpful with television shows, allowing me to get through the first three seasons of <em>Breaking</em> <em>Bad</em> in two weeks and catch up on old favorites without the burden of having to buy whole seasons (<em>Futurama</em> being a regular go-to).</p>
<p>Then something happened. A button was pressed, a switch flipped. My instant queue became stagnant, a burden. The number of occasions where my wife would fall asleep before we could locate anything worth streaming and I ended up throwing in a video game instead exponentially increased. How could this be? If anything Netflix’s streaming content had improved over the past few years, so why wasn’t I watching? I built this burdensome queue myself, for god’s sake! The problem, it seems, isn’t Netflix.</p>
<p>Streaming had taught me something about myself. Something I think I had known all along. It was never going to work out between us because the truth is that I need to be regimented. There needs to be some sort of process to keep me in line, and, as silly as it may seem, streaming was a bit <em>too</em> convenient for me.</p>
<p>There is something about the physicality of a DVD, something that implies an obligation. It is taking up space on my counter top. It is keeping me from getting the next film in my queue. I don’t mean to imply that I don’t savor every film; I most certainly do. It just seems that I need an extra kick sometimes to keep me moving along. My instant queue sat unchanged for months while I re-watched episodes of shows I’d seen a hundred times over. I’ll get to it, I thought. Since I’ve switched back to the two-DVD-at-a-time plan, I’ve rocketed through ten films in two weeks. My wife and I make plans to sit down with a film, now. It is an event, as it should be.</p>
<p>All of this has made me think a lot about the double-edged sword that is digital media. There are worlds of music, film, art and literature available to us online. From the perspective of film, I have certainly noticed an increase the accessibility of art house films. It wasn’t long ago (or maybe it was?) that I was limited by what the Main Art Theatre in Royal Oak, MI was playing. Unless, of course, I was willing to make the extra fifteen or so minute drive to the Maple on the other side of town. Now all I have to do is click a button and I fear that I am already starting to take that for granted.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s just me? All I know is that coming home to find a movie waiting in my mailbox has rejuvenated my enthusiasm, so I think I’ll hang in the dark ages* a bit longer.</p>
<p>*I haven’t even activated the Blu-ray option yet!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Young Adult poster" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.onlinemovieshut.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/young-adult-poster.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="514" /> Director Jason Reitman (Son of Ivan Reitman, a pretty well known director himself) has made some of the most easily digestible, yet incredibly smart films of the past few years. He has an impressive level of discernment when choosing projects and a penchant for protagonists who are hard to like but impossible to resist. His first film, <em>Thank You for Smoking</em> (2005), is about a big tobacco spokesman who spends as much time lying and spinning as he does trying to be a good father to his twelve year old boy. True, everybody in <em>Juno</em> (2007) is pretty damned likable, but 2009’s <em>Up in the Air</em> features a protagonist who has spent so much time travelling that he’s lost the ability to connect with anyone. Also, he fires people for a living, so there’s that. And now we have <em>Young Adult</em> (2011), which features an alcoholic young adult book ghost writer desperately clinging to her high school glory days and teetering on the brink of insanity.</p>
<p>Written by <em>Juno</em> writer Diablo Cody, <em>Young Adult</em> is just as clever but far less self aware. It doesn’t try so hard. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) has. . . hang ups, we’ll call them, but they&#8217;re introduced with great simplicity and subtlety. For instance, when she receives an email announcing the birth of her former high school beau’s first child, she does not “freak out.” Not in the traditional sense, at least. Instead, she simply prints it out and spends large chunks of time staring at it (<em>totally</em> not freaking out)!</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Mavis is clearly an alcoholic. But we don’t get the obligatory drunken stumbling, slurred speech and rows of liquor bottles. We do see Mavis wake up every morning face down on her bed, on top of the covers. She doesn’t appear to drink at home, but when she goes out she always seems to have just a few too many. Always. It’s the kind of drinking habit that might get your friends whispering behind your back, if you had any. It’s definitely the kind that sneaks up on you.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mavis comes to the conclusion that things have not shaken down for her the way they should have and that something absolutely must be done about it. Her job as a ghost writer for a popular young adult series isn’t quite as glamorous as being the actual author, and her lonely, one-bedroom apartment could be bigger. And why didn’t <em>her</em> marriage work out?! She’s awfully pretty, after all. Perhaps if she had married Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), her high school sweetheart, everything would have been different. There’s only one way to find out, and soon we find Mavis on a road trip back to her home town blaring a mix-tape Buddy had made for her on infinite loop. Mavis to the rescue.</p>
<p>It turns out that not much has changed ‘round these parts. She pretends to be disgusted by it, but everyone seems so happy. Are they just too stupid to know that they’re miserable? Too simple? At the local bar she bumps into Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt), whom she doesn’t really remember &#8212; despite having had a locker right next to him in high school &#8212; until he mentions getting beaten near to death by a group of bullies who thought that he was gay. “You’re the hate crime guy!” You’d be hard pressed to find a guy as patient as Matt.</p>
<p>Mavis reveals her plan to him (after a few drinks, of course): Convince Buddy that he’s miserable and sweep him off to Minneapolis with her to start a new life together. Never mind that he’s already married and celebrating the birth of his first child. To Mavis, these things are mere stumbling blocks. Besides, babies are “boring.” Matt does not approve, but you get the impression that he’s not ungrateful for having been invited to the shenanigans, which I shall not spoil for you.</p>
<p>Charlize Theron’s performance is fantastic. It’s not as showy as her transformation in <em>Monster</em> (2003), but it is more nuanced. Patton Oswalt is proving himself to be a pretty interesting character actor (see <em>Big Fan</em> 2009 if you think his performance came out of left field), and Patrick Wilson is pitch-perfect as well. It’s such a shame that this film came and went without much notice. It was originally marketed as a comedy, which it is not. Most of the film&#8217;s laugh out loud lines are presented in the trailer. That’s not as to say that it isn’t funny, it’s just not broad comedy funny. It’s funny because it’s sad, because it’s true. Mavis may sound like a total nightmare and that’s because she is, but there’s an important scene towards the end of the film where she visits her parents and we get a glimpse of the reasons why. Her parents still have a picture of Mavis and her ex-husband on their wall. Her father remembers him as being a “nice guy.” Her mother concurs, adding that it is a “nice” memory. When Mavis announces that she thinks that she might be an alcoholic, they laugh it off. She’s just being dramatic. Isn’t that nice?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have I mentioned that there are too many Best Picture nominees? <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">Has that come up before</a>? I digress. Once again find myself a few movies shy of the full category. And although I did manage to sneak <em>The Help</em> in at the buzzer &#8211; too late for an article &#8211; I was unable to get to<em> Hugo</em>, <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em> (Does having read the book count? And how about if I didn’t like it?) and <em>Warhorse</em>. <em>C&#8217;est la vie</em>.</p>
<p>I had convinced myself pretty early on that this was a bit of a down year. Having seen most of the films now I think that that was an unfair assessment. A few words that come to mind now are charming, insightful, sweet, and nostalgic. This may not have been a “down” year, <em>per se</em>, but it was certainly a pretty mellow one. It should also be noted that these are words one might use to describe a grandparent.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="The Artist" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/TheArtistSq.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Artist</em> wins Best Picture 2012</p></div>
<p>This year’s award show came and went without many surprises.  Out of the films that I did manage to get to I could make a pretty solid argument for at least three of them winning Best Picture, <em>The Artist</em> being one of them. I wouldn’t have minded <em>The Descendants</em> taking it, but I feel like it was too humble to stand out, and <em>The Tree of Life</em> could’ve taken it on sheer scale alone (It’s a film about EVERYTHING!).</p>
<p>All told, I’m happy with most of the victors. It does seem to be a real shame that Viola Davis didn’t take home Best Actress, but she’ll get hers one day. Meryl Streep is certainly one of the best of our time, but I’ve not heard a great many good things about <em>The Iron Lady</em>, and historically speaking acting awards tend to go to great performances in great (or at least very good) films. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/23/147291130/most-oscar-voters-are-white-male-out-of-touch">Perhaps not being entirely on the Academy’s radar demographic-wise</a> hurt Viola a little bit?</p>
<p>And where was the Best Supporting nomination for Albert Brooks in <em>Drive</em>?! Aside from that film being one of my favorites of the year, Brook’s villainy is pretty epic in it and I’m reasonably certain no one would have missed Nick Nolte’s name on that list. He’s very good in <em>Warrior</em>, but let’s face it; he’s played that character before.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest travesty for me, though, was the fact that <em>The Tree of Life’s</em> cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, didn’t go home with the gold. Yes, <em>Hugo</em> looks amazing, but I have never seen a film that looks or feels anything like <em>The Tree of Life</em>. Never. I don’t know about you, but I can’t think of a better impetus for handing someone an award.</p>
<p>It’s funny, this year I didn’t find myself terribly concerned about missing the few Best Picture noms that I did. Would I have rather seen <em>Hugo</em> than <em>The Help</em> (my wife is largely responsible for that)? Absolutely. But do I feel that I’ve missed out on <em>Extremely Loud</em> and <em>Warhorse</em>? Not really. Which brings us full circle: Were their really nine films worthy of being considered Best Picture? Can anyone give me a solid reason why <em>Extremely Loud</em>, a film hovering just under 50% on rottentomatoes.com, was even mentioned in the same breath as some of these other films? Oh well, it’s all over and done with now. And I’m reasonably certain that I’ll have another opportunity to rail on about this again next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignright" title="The Artist poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/img.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/the-artist-poster-wins__oPt.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="324" />The Artist</em> is a much cheekier film than I had expected going in, because as much as it strives for (and attains) authenticity it also spends a good deal of time winking at those who don’t like (or at least think they don’t like) silent films.</p>
<p>Its story is a sort of mash-up of <em>Singing in the rain</em> (1952) and <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> (1950) &#8212; the first being a film about the inception of the “talkie” and a young starlet who makes it big because she has a better voice than the current big name (a less squeaky one, at least), and the latter being about a washed-up silent film star left behind by her former industry to go mad in solitude. Admittedly, <em>The Artist</em> functions much better when it’s closer to the former, but the winks help with the latter.</p>
<p>These “winks” that I keep mentioning mostly come in the form of melodrama, especially towards the end, which gets to be a bit. . . much. But there are also a few clever uses of sound here and there. Hearing Jean Dujardin’s thick, French accent at the film&#8217;s end is especially fun.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dujardin, the casting is phenomenal. None of the actors, even the highly recognizable ones (John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, James Cromwell), feel out of place. But man, does Dujardin look at home in black and white! Roger Ebert described him as a cross between Sean Connery and Gene Kelly, which is pretty apropos. Berenice Bejo as the plucky young Peppy Miller doesn’t do half bad herself, with her winning smile and perfectly placed (by Dujardin, in fact) beauty mark.</p>
<p>So the order for the day here seems to be charm. There isn’t a second of <em>The Artist</em> that isn’t charming in one way or another. But can a film win a Best Picture Oscar on charm alone?</p>
<p><strong>The Artist<em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin), Best Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo), Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Costume Design, Best Directing, Best Editing, Music (original score) &amp; Best original Screenplay</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><img class="alignright" title="Moneyball poster" src="https://i0.wp.com/collider.com/wp-content/uploads/moneyball-poster.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="386" />“It’s hard not to be romantic about baseball”<br />
&#8212; Billy Beane</p></blockquote>
<p>Many great things have been said about the game of baseball (and a few silly things, too &#8212; Just Google Yogi Berra), but the above quote wraps it all up nicely and puts a bow on top. I would argue that you’d be hard-pressed to find a sport where even a regular season game, especially one early in the season, could hold as much drama as baseball. Bennett Miller’s <em>Moneyball</em> opens with a playoff loss and closes with one, but it focuses on a record-setting winning streak during the Oakland A’s 2002 regular season.</p>
<p>Beane, played by Brad Pitt, attributes the season’s winning ways to a team-building system devised by a night watchman at a pork and beans cannery named Bill James, now an advisor for the Boston Red Sox. James’ theory is that you choose players based on specific skill sets regardless of their perceived worth and overall talent. Beane is introduced to this system by a young Yale grad named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill).</p>
<p>Of course everyone thinks that Beane’s lost his. . . beans. But the wins begin to pile up, and you can’t argue with wins. Well, I suppose you can. Even Beane states that he won’t be truly satisfied until they’ve won it all. Even then he’d probably just want to do it again.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time with Billy Beane off the field, which is easy because we’re told that superstition prevents him from watching the games on television, let alone live. He is a doting father and an honest, hard-working guy who doesn’t take himself too seriously. I was thoroughly impressed by how well Pitt was able to disappear into the character and contribute to Beane&#8217;s high level of likeability. If you had asked me beforehand whether or not I would expect a potential award-winning performance from him I would have said no, but there it is.</p>
<p><em>Moneyball</em> is cleverly written (<em>The Social Network</em> writer Aaron Sorkin was involved, after all), well-directed and perfectly acted. The only real question is whether or not it is too quiet to stand out in the crowd. Well, if the montage of Oakland’s 20-win streak doesn’t get them, then I just don’t know what would have.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moneyball</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brad Pitt), Best Supporting Actor (Jonah Hill), Film editing, Sound Mixing &amp; Best Adapted Screenplay</strong></p>
