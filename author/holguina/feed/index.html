										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If someone ever asks you to write for a blog about the things you love, do it. Do it even if writing is already your work and you feel like a failure at it. Do it even if you worry that your opinions will be judged &#8212; that you’ll be deemed too nerdy or not nerdy enough. Do it even if you can’t do anything else; you’ve given up on leaving the couch or brushing your teeth. Do it especially if the urge to nap is your most passionate everyday drive. </p>
<p>When I was asked to write for <em>The Idler</em> I was a mess. I’d spent a lifetime perfecting my identity as head-of-the-class straight-A student only to reach a point in grad school where everything I did was wrong. School wasn’t just school, it was a structure, an armor that kept me safe and all of a sudden it had become unknowable, strange, threatening. Ever an anxious person, my anxieties had begun to overwhelm me and inhibit my functioning. I would will myself to write and nothing would come. I’d sit paralyzed before my screen or notebook too terrified to bother the world with another mistake, a poorly chosen word, a stillborn idea. I developed a phobia of email and phone messages fearing that they, like the endless comments in the marginalia of my work, would tell me something awful. Any negative news could further solidify me in my stuckness, could shock me into a state of literal immobility for days, or even weeks. Writing for <em>The Idler</em> thus offered an attractive distraction. The chance to take up my knowledge of pop culture as a writing subject was a welcome one. With less at stake, my pen began to scribble. A semi-professional television watcher, the prospect of writing about something like the themes of <em>Mad Men</em> loosened up my tic-tacking typing fingers again.</p>
<p>Beyond giving me a space to publically admire the entertainers I love (Maria Bamford, Margaret Cho, Louis C.K.) <em>The Idler</em> allowed me to practice, if in a much smaller way, the brave acts of these folks. I’ve used my bi-weekly column to think through art I’ve seen, movies I’ve watched, but it’s also been extremely important to me to employ this platform as a space of self reflection that helps me sort through, question, and understand what I know and feel and how pop culture aids in these processes. My relationships to fashion, Buffy, working out, media, etc. are mediated by a past thick with stories, and I’ve been so lucky to find a place where I can write my way through these connections. Shaking out readings, reviews, and interpretations through the sieve of my experience is what I do, how I think, and if anything has been heartening in the past few years of idling, it’s been the acceptance, and understanding, and thanks I’ve received for sharing what could easily be read as solipsistic journalings. </p>
<p>What I so desperately and intensely appreciate in the work of my favorite writers and comedians is their ability to reroute our paths to the truth. Sharing pain and shame and fear is powerful and instead of pretending to be above or beyond it, speaking at the level of the shit that brings us down has the incredible power of also rerouting our cultural and emotional responses to what is real and how it is perceived. If I’ve created even one teensy droplet of that magical work, attempted that bravery, or at least sold one person on the possibility that such bravery matters, I am contented and fulfilled. </p>
<p>As <em>The Idler</em> comes to a close, I find myself still struggling with the ghosts of depression and anxiety, but I am so very much stronger now. This writing has helped me. Having writing deadlines at all has been useful, finding feedback that is sweet and thoughtful and caring and supportive has been healing. Reacquainting myself with play, fun, and humor again has been a blast but it’s also helped me remember who I am at my core (a Betty Boop librarian in a Parisian salon full of dogs who read books). </p>
<p>So, I just have to say, thank you for reading, sharing, responding. Thanks for the conversations, with a shout out to Bob Hope, thanks for the memories. You could say all of this idling may have been silly, may have “just” been more blogging out into the sprawling interweb maw of a million voices, may have been a stupid distraction keeping me from more important, professional, or better work, but as a wise dude once said, “yeah, well, that’s just, like, your opinion, man.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday’s episode of <em>Mad Men</em>, “The Crash,” was packed with break ups, break ins, and breakdowns. Framed by the volatile relationship between the ad company and the Chevy account, the episode examines how things fall apart, both in and out of the office, through the tropes of collision, danger, safety and care. Herky-jerky and oddly paced, “The Crash” quite purposefully suffers from an irregular heartbeat that drives the viewer quickly forward, while also maintaining an unsettling sense of disquiet on the verge of nausea. We’re meant to feel feverish, sick. We’re meant to follow the fall of Don Draper and vicariously experience the thrill and horror of that flight/fall.</p>
<p>The office (newly merged with a business rival), Don (desperate to win Sylvia back), and the country (steadily losing troops in Vietnam) are all slipping and sliding, trying to stand on shaky ground. Beginning with a bang, the show opens with a scene of reckless driving and an automobile crash. Ken Cosgrove fearfully tries to control the wheel but the raucously drunk Chevy clients laugh and swat at him, brandish a gun, cover his eyes. The men question his masculinity because he won’t speed up, and eventually they overpower him, coaxing the car head-on into danger. When we next see Ken he’s injured and hobbling on crutches. He seeks sympathy but his co-workers don’t seem to care. </p>
<p>There’s a ton going on in this episode, but I was most interested in the issues of health and sickness and what it means to be a man. The show’s made an icon of Don Draper &#8212; he’s heralded as a mysterious lothario, a sixties “pimp,” and people, men, seem to find him admirable for this. Yet, lately, he’s off his game. His moments of Draper ad magic are coming with less frequency, less pop, and his love-’em-and-leave-’em sex magic seems pretty dried up, too, since he’s become needy, even frightening, in his desire for Sylvia. “The Crash” could be read as his coming down from a Sylvia high &#8212; the doctor’s wife acting as his anodyne, his distracting drug. Though we’ve seen Draper use sex as medicine before, something is different about this particular relationship. He places a much higher value on her, spins out of control, is lost and manic when she shuts her door to him. </p>
<p>Speaking of panaceas, things get uber weird when the company higher-ups call in a doctor to basically administer speed to the employees. Injected with a performance enhancing serum (business-man boner pills, anyone?), the copywriters are to gain focus, clarity, energy with one little shot. It seems only men take the drug and almost immediately foot races, and games of strength and fortitude fill the space. With the men turned little boys, the workplace is boiled down to its essence &#8212; &#8220;I can do it better, run faster, pee farther, than the next guy.&#8221; The serum causes quite the frenzied production, not to mention pretty serious side effects and hallucinations, but nothing that could actually count as usable, viable, ideas. </p>
<p>However, it is striking that the serum (and perhaps being on the brink of exhaustion) frees up emotional expression for the Mad Men. After the drug is administered, the fellas ask each other, “can you feel anything?” Though in reference to the serum taking effect, the question hangs starkly in the air. Do they feel? When and how? In the temporary “insanity” of sorts that follows, Don pleads with Sylvia on the phone shouting, “I’m feeling a lot of emotions!” Ken performs a bizarre yet marvelous soft shoe whilst expressing pent up hatred for his job, and Stan reaches out to Peggy seeking sex as succor for emotional wounds. Where this magical medicine is supposed to “fix” these men by creating efficient capitalist output, the episode uses the trip to explore much realer pains and ailments that expectations of masculinity won’t allow them to properly address. Why does my heart hurt? How and why do I work in an abusive environment? How do I grieve?</p>
<p>Don’s pain, of course, is central. For Draper, “The Crash” is about collisions within himself. Physical and mental smash together as his emotional detritus takes on somatic shape. After a particularly painful discussion with Sylvia, he collapses into a guttural cough that at some moments is indiscernible from sobbing &#8212; for this high power male exec, his sadness is his sickness. The cough threads us back to his past as Dick Whitman sick with a severe chest cold. His mother, rather than caring for the boy with hot chicken soup (the stuff that ads are made of) banishes him to the basement so as not to infect the others in the whorehouse with Dick’s supposed consumption. Layered with this painful lack of care is an even more twisted knot of memories. A whore takes him into her room, watches over him, nurses him to health, and then uses her power, age, and experience to take Dick’s virginity in what appears to be an abusive act. Yes, this could seem a cop-out backstory for a flawed character, but I don’t think it excuses his behavior, so much as gives it some context. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, Don Draper could hone the sadness of his past into the shiny, nostalgic, artifice of his work, his ads genius feats of psychological alchemy. In this episode, his feelings and history are overburdening the work. In his frenzied state he confuses work and home life in an unproductive and depressing manner. He spends all his time building an ad for himself, crafting the perfect spiel that will sell Don Draper, will get a foot back into Sylvia’s door. But, he’s also selling something to himself, the narrative that this woman is the key, the mother and lover that he’s always wanted but never had. Hopefully, the viewer discomfort churned up in episodes like this one will allow the audience to rethink Draper’s smoothness and make him a more nuanced character in a complex gender structure. One in which our performances as men and women are constantly negotiating power, expression, and perception. </p>
<p>All the edges of the episode suggest that there is no safety, people lie, there’s no one we can trust. Where early <em>Mad Men</em> revelled in the intoxicating allure of embellishment, this season is dipping into the emptiness and horror that can structure a lie. Peggy, though she harbors an avoidant past of her own, suggests that we have to let ourselves feel painful emotions, that we can’t “dampen [them] with drugs and sex,” but as one can imagine, this advice is not very popular. “The Crash” undoubtedly presents a male desire for care and comfort (coded as feminine) along with freedom from typical masculine roles, but sadly it suggests that truthfully engaging with such desires is a temporary madness that the right ad, right soup, right fuck can cure. It gives a compelling interpretation of the world of men then and now, tender, lost boys in beards and button up shirts, white-knuckling the wheel, holding on for dear life while secretly wishing to be in the passenger seat. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never been an athlete. The only marathons I’ve ever been interested in are the kinds about special victim units, crime scene investigations, or drag queen reality shows. In elementary school, I hid behind the giant shady tree to avoid my turn at bat on the baseball diamond. In soccer, I’d run around and try to escape the ball and the action. In high school P.E., the volleyball girls would yell at me and sigh their hissy sighs because I’d cost us all the points. If I had to do any kind of racing, I just picked the shortest distance possible so I could get coming in last over with as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>My mom’s side of the family is full of athletes; they keep themselves busy with sports of all kinds, but of all the meets, games, and matches of theirs I’d observe, running seemed to be the most attractive to me. Maybe it’s because there’s no team or rules or sets of special skills I could mess up. Maybe it’s because it offered a way of being athletic <em>sans</em> the threat of being hit by any kind of ball, but running seemed like something I could maybe, possibly figure out how to do. </p>
<p>During middle school and high school summers off, I’d watch my aunt with her giant muscled calves, circling the track, ponytail bobbing. I’d go with her to her workouts, walk the same circle and another nearby dirt path ad nauseum. Sometimes my cousin would join us. We’d all arrive in the same car, stretch at the same time, but they’d go one direction and I’d go another. I’d wonder what they talked about, double ponytails bobbing, and I’d feel really lonely, soft, round, and slow. And all the endless walking never seemed enough, never shaped my calves into angled mounds, never made me the kind of girl who had the kind of juicy problems worthy of puzzling through on a long run with an adult. Walking could be calming, could provide a pleasant admixture of thought and movement that would cushion introspection or spin out the wordy tendrils of a poem or story, and it was freeing, but in comparison to the running, the runners, it felt pathetic. </p>
<p>Yet, a few weeks ago, I ran a half marathon. I’m still not sure how that happened. I know I joined a running team, found a Saturday running partner. I know I put in the time and the grumbling and the pain and the doubt. Did I cry and/or beat myself up when I had a bad run? Yup. Often, it felt like such a ridiculous trick I was playing on myself &#8212; who was I fooling trying to outrun myself? My identity as fat smart kid seems so. . . inescapable. Anything else is beyond my comprehension. I don’t get how people feel strong and capable, how they throw their arms up in victory, feel like powerful monsters that pad around in sneakers and tear up the road. After my race I knew I wanted to feel confident and proud; it was amazing to hear praise about what I’d accomplished. But my feelings haven’t caught up with my mind. I understand that I did an amazing thing, that my body pushed through the shit of my past, proved stronger than I ever imagined it could be, but the mantle of the runner still fits awkward on my frame.</p>
<p>Early in the race a train halted any progress forward. Everyone around me was pissed (or pissing), I was enjoying an impromptu parade in my brain &#8212; a rousing rendition of some Souza tune for this free break in the drudgery. But, then looking around me, there was that familiar lonesome hollow in my gut. These people were competitors, and thus somehow more “real” than I was. Though I wished that I had hopped the train like a hobo of olden days, I kept going, pounded bruises into my toenails, popped bloody blisters while climbing hills. My partner and I spotted dogs, discussed their fluff, or butts, or faces. No ponytails, but our thick calves did flex in rhythm. </p>
<p>At the end of the race I broke down. Had to stop, had to breathe and uncoil a knot in my belly. I let my partner go on and I freaked out for a good minute. Ghosts rushed through me, all the thoughts that hurt. “Here you go, getting so close and collapsing. You can’t finish anything. See? You don’t belong here. See? You’re all alone.” And I kept going, feeling like I’d already lost but needing to save face. That last bit felt stupid and awful and dumb and stupid again and just when I was about to walk a bit more, some man I don’t even know told me NO. “You will not stop,” he said, “you can run with me and we’ll do this together.” Except I couldn’t hear a damn thing he was saying but somehow that was communicated. There was wind in my ears, but he was guiding me through the whole ending, what was left and how to do it. It didn’t matter that the words never landed, it was just so good, so incredibly good, to not be alone, to lift out of that sports + me = alienation equation for long enough to cross the finish line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know Claire Huxtable and Roseanne Conner are pretty fantastic big mamas of the small screen, but who will make my list of dream moms?</p>
<p><strong>Linda Belcher of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em></strong></p>
<p>If I could only pick one TV mama to be my very own, it would have to be Linda Belcher. With big flippy hair, a penchant for sing-narrating everything she’s thinking, and a flair for the dramatic, this burger joint matriarch could very well be my genetic mother (I might be part cartoon). Linda is fantastic and refreshing because she’s so dorkily proud of her kids even and especially when they are doing or saying what others would deem troubling or strange. Tina’s writing erotic fiction about her peers? Linda excitedly responds to the “artsy fartsy” creativity of this hobby exclaiming, “Freaky friend fiction, all right!” When her attempt at producing dinner theatre in the restaurant is poorly reviewed &#8212; the set looks like children made it &#8212; rather than taking a negative critique negatively, she’s bursting with pride. It was made by children! Her children! </p>
<p>Ms. Belcher is a cool, kooky, sweet, funny mom who loves everything her kids make and do. A bastion of support, jokes, and cuddles, she can be a little over-the-top motherly, but ultimately I admire that she’s so incredibly hard to disappoint. She showers her family of weirdies with respect and accolades that ring perfectly silly and genuine and she does so without asking them to be better. Instead, she can be counted on to accept them and celebrate them as they are. Now, that’s all kinds of  “all right!”</p>
<p>Here’s Linda kissing her porcelain collection of babies. Imagine what she’s like with her real kids!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ns9Mbsr3gUQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Lorelai Gilmore of <em>Gilmore Girls</em></strong></p>
<p>Now, I avoided <em>Gilmore Girls</em> like the plague for a long while when it was on the air. It looked like a sappy, stupid mother-daughter fantasy land where mom and kid are best pals who share all their secrets over root beer and pizza. Well, yeah. Okay, Stars Hollow is pretty much a fantasy place and the Lorelais are definitely fantasy women, but once you get past all your cynical Sally stuff (How can they eat junk all the time and never gain weight? How can they watch all the TV and movies and still have time to read <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em>? How could a real mom be that awesome?) you fall in love with the fantasy. </p>
<p>When Lorelai is being a “drag” of a parent it’s often because she’s pushing Rory to be more daring &#8212; wear a two piece bathing suit, sneak out of the house. Mama Gilmore does anything and everything to provide for her girl; she supplies Lorelai Junior with all the books, warmth, junk food, and cable channels that a growing woman needs. With a ton of femme knowledge that far surpasses regular mom tricks like “smudge some lipstick on your cheekies!,” Lorelai has all the fashion know-how to make a blah cardigan look like a fetching, but not trying too hard, signature piece. When it comes down to it, L.G. is just your typical total knockout, monied teen mom, who leaves the lap of luxury to live life by her own standards and provide for her daughter in the quaintest most pop culturally saturated existence possible. She knows everything from Muppets to Monet, the Go-Gos to <em>Grey Gardens</em>, and just about any of her spit-fire dialogue is incredibly quotable. I’m not ashamed to say it (anymore), I’d love to be a Gilmore Girl. </p>

<p><strong>Sophia Petrillo of <em>The Golden Girls</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve been watching and LOVING <em>The Golden Girls</em> since I was a kid. So, maybe I didn’t get why Rose accidentally buying extra large condoms (and then the grocery guy announcing it for a price check) was hilarious, but everything else translated well, and I’m pretty sure I get that condom joke, now, thank you very much. Even as a girl, I identified with Dorothy (do with that what you will) but you wouldn’t need to be a Dortothy to love her mom, Sophia, and envy their awesomely sarcastic and loving relationship. </p>
<p>Sophia is the perfect little old lady. That grandma shuffle? That wicker bag? A great listener, an old school classic storyteller (“Picture it &#8212; Sicily&#8230;), and the comedic timing and blunt brashness of Don Rickles. Sassy, sexy, and fun, this lil’ mama is just as comfortable volunteering caring for sickies at the hospital as painting the town red with Mr. Burt Reynolds. She’s the kind of mom who you’d actually want to shack up with you and your best buds, and she’s the kind of mom who will continue to love her “pussycat” daughter with all her wicked little Italian heart. . . even if that daughter has sent her to “the home” at least once before. That’s amore!</p>
<p>A favorite Sophia and Dorothy moment. Why isn’t this MY life?!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m from Las Cruces, New Mexico, a city populated by around 99,000 people where you can somehow still run into everyone you know at the Super Walmart on Valley Drive and Avenida de Mesilla. It’s the kind of place where high school sports rivalries are king, where teenagers huddle down into a dusty ditch bank and drink watered down beer while fields of cotton grow dry and wooly and the sun bakes the ground into a crack-fissured clay. The weather forecast forms a bingo board of little yellow sunshines, disturbed every once in a good while by thunderous storms that pour in fresh wet stripes punctuated with whipcrack flashes of lightning. </p>
<p>People there talk in funny accents &#8212; a marriage of cool, laid-back, Californian English and dramatically elongated Spanish syllables. One “gets down” from the car to go into the store, and carries the onus of a silly nickname like a mythological birthright. The food is fat with flavor, the culture, thick with artists. Stay long enough and a slow and sleepy boredom seeps deep into your bones, not a boredom that irritates so much as builds a gravity that keeps you in one place, makes you stay &#8212; warm, dream-heavy, happy. When choosing a grad school, I picked faraway places on the map fearing the lotus-eater lull of my beautiful home and an almost genetic tendency toward petrified paralysis. I’ve been working through the cold perspective of living in East Lansing, Michigan for about 10 years, now.</p>
<p>I’d never been to Boston, Massachusetts until a few weeks ago. Everything I knew of the place was a small collage of colonial history, Celtics basketball, the regulars of the downstairs bar, <em>Cheers</em>, and some dramatic scenes from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. (“I gawt huh numbuh&#8211;how bout them ah-pples?”) Representing the non-fiction journal I work for at MSU, I attended a conference for the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) in a complex hamster cage of a hotel conference center/shopping mall in downtown Boston. Imagine thousands of writers anxiously milling about in their scarves and wryly chosen spectacles. Aisle after aisle of booths, books, authors, publishers, editors. In some ways I felt completely at home. Not geographically, per se, but in my seat of comfort and power; I was in a place where my love for literature and language could find friendship and revel in nerdy delights. In other ways I felt completely lost and alienated. Amidst the movement, the clouds of chatter, the thousands of people just like me, I could at times feel dull, null, nil. </p>
<p>The snow outside was falling sideways in wet messy sheets. The streets were puddled with thick ice water ponds much deeper than my sneakered toe could dip. Inside, the conference hummed with body heat and dizzying distraction, the intermingling exhalations of too many mouths.</p>
<p>Making my way through the labyrinthine levels and turns, past the conference center, the Starbucks, the Coach store, beyond the reach of Armani, Louis Vuitton, the kiosks at the mall, down the escalator and across a hidden underpass below the exposed snowy street above, I bought a ticket on the train and booked it to Harvard. Nervous and alone I watched the stops on the map too closely. I focused tightly on the colored lines, the dots for each station, as Boston people populated and detrained the car with an easy indifference.</p>
<p>After trudging through slick muck in Harvard Square for at least twenty minutes, I was cold, lost, and spent, but I found the tattoo shop, finally. My friend’s brother, Sky, was my artist. He’s from my hometown, but I’d never met him. And here we were, together, two desert kids in Massachusetts telling stories of sun, Spanish art, the power of tamales and cholo style. And he was quiet, funny, smart, thoughtful, with a tiny Zia symbol etched behind his ear. A teacher, a maker, an avid Netflixer, much like myself. And he carved a red heart into my forearm, needled in colors of New Mexico sunsets onto the banner, marked my love of TV (with equal parts wink and sincerity) into the geography of my body. When the pain burned hotter and my eyes would roll back away from the whirring, Dia de los Muertos and retablo inspired pieces settled my gaze. We talked about loving a place, our home, and how we could never really go back. Our stories overlapping with the colors he was stitching. Intersecting lines and routes. Mappings. Intersecting lines and roots. </p>
<p>No longer lost, I made my way back to the dirty subway platform, still concrete and grey, still alien, but a little less scary, a little more known. Cold, tired, surrounded by strangers, I carried my new gift home. My heart throbbing in my coat sleeve, hidden, secret, and mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written before about <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/14/treat-yoself-to-parks-and-rec/">how much I love <em>Parks and Recreation</em></a> &#8212; the characters, the writing &#8212; but I haven’t been too happy with this season’s trajectory. Though I am pleased with the progression of Chris Traeger’s character and the manner in which his obsessive traits have been seriously examined, the current portrayal of Leslie Knope feels both incredibly off and off-putting. The shift in Chris was unexpected. The writers could easily have kept milking his trademark perfectionism without question &#8212; his extreme fitness and nutrition practices acting merely as reminders that Chris is “that guy,” a strange, yet colorful, weirdo in this merry band of weirdos. But, instead Parks opted for depth. Lately, we’ve seen Chris’ fears laid bare and more overtly witnessed his “quirks” explained as excessive and possibly even disordered behavior. This choice is pretty brave and refreshing &#8212; to show a man who seems perfect, if grossly on top of things, and unpack that perfection as an unhealthy desire for control manifested through unhealthy treatment of his body. Pretty progressive and neat. Parks is usually pretty thoughtful like that. </p>
<p>But then there’s this issue with Leslie. Ever since Leslie got engaged to geeky pocket cutie Ben, things have been weird, y’all. The wedding, per sitcom norm, has taken up a lot of story time and space. On one level that makes me sad because it’s so cliché. Weddings, babies, the addition of a dog, or a cousin Oliver, all seem to mark the death of a show as we once knew it. There’s a sense that when these narratives pop up that maybe the show has run out of steam. I know that in terms of storytelling, this situation can be more complex. Perhaps romances, babies, dogs, and long lost cousins are parts of important stories and that’s why we see them cycled through so often on the television, but I for one, think that there also must be so much more unexplored TV territory and I was hoping my favorite show would go there, courageously and hilariously. </p>
<p>Personally, I’m not all that interested in Ben and Leslie’s romance. I like Ben. I’m glad she found a cool guy, but I’m definitely not gushing over their nuptials. The latest episodes have been particularly uncomfortable to me because they show Leslie barely capable of containing her love for Ben. We learn that getting married to her cute-butted, elflike lover is her dream come true. Spoiler alert, the couple even ties the knot 3 months early because she just can’t wait any longer to be his wife. Um, what? Again, I’m glad that Leslie’s in love or whatever, but when has marriage ever been a top priority for Ms. Knope? The Leslie I know has always wanted to be a strong, fair, and caring woman, an important politician who works for the people of her beloved town, if not the entire nation. Leslie’s dream come true, to me, would look something like President Knope (and maybe first gentleman Joe Biden) raising mini horses on the White House lawn. The Biden husband would be a nice extra, but the presidency and the mini horses would be a must. </p>
<p>So for Parks to get all sweet and saccharine on me, celebrating wuv, twoo wuv, and beyond that painting Leslie as so intensely eager for a typical marital union, without considering the political ramifications of what that union might mean. . . well, it’s a little shocking and disappointing. I know it’s not like we found out that Leslie is a serial killer or she secretly hates puppies, but this move just doesn’t match the tone or consistency of the show and character that I love.</p>
<p>Will marriage end up being more of a struggle now that the fun, pretty, and sugar-coated part is over? (The bachelor party episode did indeed remind us that almost every male character is divorced, after all). Will the old Leslie’s passion for politics return as though no sitcom narrative cliché ever occured? Or will this strange feminist show I love jump the Pawnee shark (raccoon?) and become a more typical network show? Time will tell, I guess.</p>
<p>Instead of titillating my inner romantic, Leslie and Ben making it official has left me mourning stories where it’s okay for women to want different things, want more, want something beyond or outside marriage. I’m left wishing the Hillary Clinton of the hilarious memes could send my gal Leslie a text, cuz, Giiiirrrrl, something’s up with your game. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know Nick Offerman as the straightforward, bacon-eating, curmudgeon, Ron Swanson, of NBC’s <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. He’s made quite a name for himself there playing the role of a strictly anti-government parks worker to deadpan perfection. Reaching the heights of pop cultural iconography, his Swansonisms sprawl across the internets and he’s won the masses over with his affectless stoicism, the charm of one eyebrow raised ever so slightly. But like his lovely wife before him, Megan Mullally, who played the fantabulously drevil (drunk and evil) Karen Walker on <em>Will and Grace</em>, it’s become easy to equate the actor with their most famous role. Though Swanson and Offerman do share a lot in common (meat hankerings, saxophone playing, finely groomed mustaches) there are many faces to Offerman that you may not have seen yet. </p>
<p>Having read a number of Offerman interviews and articles, I knew that he was a legit farm boy who then studied stage acting and excelled not only at his theatrical craft, but also in the crafting of sets and costumes. Though he has lots of Hollywood experience, he also feels at home performing Kabuki theater and abstract postmodernist plays. He makes silly music videos with his wife and runs a serious carpentry business where he builds beautiful furniture and seaworthy canoes. Quite a talented grab bag, this fella. That being said, I wasn’t exactly sure what I’d signed up for by purchasing a ticket to <em>American Ham</em>, Offerman’s one-man show. </p>
<p>Well, last Friday night I plopped myself down in my folding chair in the Royal Oak theater &#8212; close enough to be giddy, far away enough that I couldn’t easily storm the stage (you’re welcome, Nick). No opening act, no announcer, no muss no fuss, Nick Offerman sauntered on stage with that trademarked direct stare and downturned grumpy cat mouth. Shirtless, wearing jeans and a guitar strapped to his bod, he made his way to the mic, offered a brisk hello and promptly put on a denim stars and stripes shirt. Our semi-nudity for the night complete, he got down to business. </p>
<p>The next couple hours consisted of spoken word and sometimes musical didacticism &#8212; a fine marriage of honesty, humor, and personal philosophy. Like the traveling Chatauqua shows of the early 21st century, his show is a kind of educational entertainment for adults. Though he begins by espousing Biblical teachings the ilk of “Do unto others,” he also heartily deconstructs “The Good Book” claiming that <em>The Hobbit</em> is also a good book that is far more consistent. (Offerman knows a lot about elves and wizards and things &#8212; a fun nerd surprise). He unpacks the importance of engaging in romantic love, no matter what your sexual preference, and exposes the ridiculous sexism of the Bible’s male writers who helped solidify a culture of woman fear and woman hating. I liked this part a lot. Any man who reminds his peers that menstruation is not disgusting or unclean gets a high-five from this gal. Beyond this, he discusses the value of “please and thank you,” the power of hard work, and good drugs (used responsibly, of course). He urged us be in nature, avoid the pitfalls of the mirror (our flaws are not as awful as advertisers claim), and he strongly suggested that we pick up a hobby, develop a discipline, find passion for a craft and the honing of it. Oh, and always carry a handkerchief to wipe a sweaty brow, politely blow one’s nose, or apply a tourniquet to a bleeding neighbor’s flesh wound. </p>
<p>Offerman is clearly a man who delights in words, multisyllable ones and curse words alike. He takes pleasure in speaking slowly and picking the appropriate term for the situation, likes the feel of a complex notion taking shape on his tongue. But perhaps best of all, his calm, measured lecturing is easily broken by a mischievous giggle that bubbles up out from under his mustache at odd intervals. The crowd could not help but burst into laughter in response every time. </p>
<p>Was there some Ron Swanson in there? Definitely, but not too much. <em>American Ham</em> was very much about balance. It showed me that Nick Offerman has delighted in being both a stalwart American man &#8212; a quiet, tree-hewing, meat-grilling sort, but also the gentle idiot, the ham who plays and wants to be seen playing, the kind of man who hand-makes cards for his “sweet stack of curves” wife along with the dorkiest loving song about how hard he’s gonna do her. Likewise, though his show takes us back in time to a simpler, plainer form of entertainment, it is good and hearty fare. See the show, go outside, make a craft. Those Ron Swanson gifs will still be there when you get back, and if Offerman is right, they’ll be all the sweeter once you’ve earned them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in graduate coursework for my English degree it was “normal” to stay up reading and taking notes until 3 a.m., to shun social contact until all the work was done, to finish one book, take a “break” to cram a sandwich in my face and then crack open the next brain-bending text. If I did make it to a party or a lunch or a movie, I’d just mentally destroy myself for taking time away from studying. How many pages could I have read in those precious hours? How many papers could I have graded? Well practiced in self-denial, this grad school narrative though exacting, was familiar, and in that way comfortable. My family, my culture, my society have all taught me that I am to give, be humble, be sweet and sorry. Apologize, try harder, be better, but quietly. Be smaller, tighter, harder, faster. Be good &#8212; I excelled at being good, but being good is not always great for me.</p>
<p>I was at least three quarters of the way done with my classes when my friend Lauren told me that she takes one class session off from each course every semester. That she absolves herself from having to go in, sit on the hotseat, participate. She maybe lightly skims the text or reads without taking as thorough notes, or maybe skips a book completely(!) but then on class night, she just stays home and takes a bath, drinks wine, watches a movie. </p>
<p>My response to this: “Wha? No go school is possible?!”<br />
Lauren: Yes. You have to take time for yourself to survive.<br />
Me: *Blank stare*</p>
<p>Huh. So self care is a thing. A real thing that people do. And they enjoy it. And the pleasure of honoring oneself with even the smallest of gifts is healing. Imagine that. I was maybe 24 years old and the freeing concept of taking care of yourself was confusing and new. I tried out her little trick and my god was it glorious, satisfying, fulfilling. And here I am, now, at 31 still learning to fully accept self care and its political ramifications, working on understanding that our cultural constructions of selfishness and what is proper and what is right, what is appropriate or excessive, harden us and rob us of the ability to value ourselves, to expect or ask for more. While we recognize inequalities and speak and fight against unfair practices, it’s also powerful, and radical even, to show kindness to yourself. </p>
<p>Your gut reaction to this may be that this is wildly narcissistic and radically lazy. This is whiny baby hedonism from touchy-feely feminists, and it’s this kind of criticism that we automatically assume and internalize and it’s this authoritarian rhetoric that makes self care so difficult. </p>
<p>It is difficult and I’m still practicing. . .</p>
<p>Finding beauty in my eye sparkle. </p>
<p>Stopping to appreciate the brilliant architectural mind of a winter wiener dog as he drags the blankets to his nestled fort. He has a lot to teach us! Three pillows may not be enough. </p>
<p>It’s okay to save your delicate feet the grief of a rocky path &#8212; it’s okay to refuse it. </p>
<p>Slip on tights<br />
that let your finger delight<br />
in drawing<br />
up<br />
the<br />
seam.</p>
<p>Say, “fuck the rules,” for once.</p>
<p>Go fuck yourself (for twice) and/or get someone else to help you.</p>
<p>Asking the gentle yogi how to practice angry She-Hulk yoga is not a stupid question. </p>
<p>Practice boasting. Accept compliments as they are &#8212; resist revision. </p>
<p>Closely examine every puppy. In the world. Start conversations with them, pet their bellies, imagine where they’d most like to vacation and why. </p>
<p>It’s okay to block feeds that make you tired. To be quiet when you don’t want to speak.<br />
To dress up for no reason or star in a naked parade.<br />
To imagine that Buffy, and Jo March, and bell hooks are some of your best friends. . .<br />
and to secretly know that they really are.<br />
To write until your fingers bleed and sing all the words wrong. </p>
<p>Writing for <em>The Idler</em> is a form of self care. It pushes me to do something I love, to practice sharing my voice and it helps me create and find community. People tell me that I’m brave when I tell my stories and I respond with the truth, that it’s important for me to out myself as anxiety ridden, struggling with depression, recovering from eating disorders, learning how to NOT be a good quiet woman, learning how to negotiate my chicananess, my sexuality, my pretensions, my privileges. It’s important for me to tell what so often remains secret because we so need to talk about these things and not feel alone. Nothing changes if we don’t share these stories and we feel like isolated mutants when we don’t have access to portrayals of lives like our own. </p>
<p>But what do I think when someone tells me that I’m brave? I imagine that I’m a loser, a jerk, an idiot narcissist who tells her two bit tales to anyone who will pay her attention. I feel badly that people think I’m brave when I’m really not. I feel badly because what if people say I’m brave but are secretly judging? </p>
<p>And I shouldn’t have to do this and my go-to, automatic, comfortable and at-the-ready response shouldn’t be self hatred, or “I’m sorry,” or “I take it back.” This is why I need self care &#8212; to practice my way out of what’s taught me that I am small and of little value.</p>
<p>Accept compliments as they are &#8212; resist revision.</p>
<p>Practice, practice, practice.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about clothes lately. I mean, I think about clothes constantly &#8212; I love fashion &#8212; but recently I’ve been aching for a new look, the right look. This happens every once in awhile. Years go by and I begin to notice that the wardrobe in my closet doesn’t match me anymore. In one way or another, it doesn’t fit. Like a sloughing of the skin, a regeneration, I begin to itch in the once-perfect sweater. I notice the bruised, tired soles on the once-favorite shoes. </p>
<p>My various looks have been governed by many a whim and many a hope. In 8th grade, I bought every piece of clothing that was covered with sunflowers, so that a field of the cheery hippie-90s flower hung in a long hangered row. By sophomore and junior year of high school, I’d eliminated all that mustard yellow for crisp A-line skirts and dresses, platform patent leather maryjanes and any cheap modern knock-off of Mary Tyler Moore’s style (Mr. Grant and Rhoda era Moore, not Dick Van Dyke). For the briefest moment I sought all things Tommy Hillfiger and Polo. Carefully collecting classic striped sweaters, khakis, and clean-lined brown leather ankle boots, I tried to sell myself as serious (and more monied) chic, but though others wore the brands so crisply, to me it felt like the most boring disguise. My retro theme soon returned in the form of polyester short-sleeve button downs in loud patterns and colors, and supa dupa fly white shell toe Adidas. </p>
<p>In college, I played twee baby “punk,” dumpy hoodie schlump, and thrift store art girl. The latter felt the most authentic even as I carried the giant patent leather bag of someone’s dead grandmother and rocked the pale blue trousers of the slim matching gramps. </p>
<p>Sometimes I dressed up hoping I’d find the person I was looking for waiting in the neon purple mohair, or filling the pink suede triple-velcro-strap sneakers. Maybe I’d find her in the thickest smudge of eyeliner. Maybe I’d glimpse her in the mirror wearing fishnets and pointy stilettos. </p>
<p>Other times I dressed for my mood or my body. Recurring depressions are archived in dark baggy clothing. The year I went “sporty” in oversized baseball t-shirts, loose jeans, and hip running shoes, my sartorial choices quietly covered over the tear-stained junk food binges. </p>
<p>The cobalt blue and white H&amp;M wrap dress tessellated with geometric shapes bespoke confidence, comfort, the beginnings of self-acceptance. Paired with 4.5 inch chocolate wedge sandals, I walked healthily, happily, to teach my first stand-alone classes.</p>
<p>One grey and gnarled college hoodie marked a year of loneliness, a sadness I couldn’t fathom, a fatness that somehow seemed less shameful or (maybe, hopefully) invisible under this cloak. It couldn’t really be so, but I remember the texture of this piece as fuzzy, furry, but rough like a Brillo pad. It said, “don’t touch me, don’t see me, I’m not really here.”</p>
<p>A thin-mint green wool sweater, three-quarter-sleeved with a jaunty shoulder-baring collar. So 50’s sweater girl, yet I wore it while presenting a paper at my first academic conference. </p>
<p>The fright/glee when my skinniest pair of jeans shimmied down of their own volition, past jutting hip bones, into a sloppy sag. To take them off at the end of the day, no need to unbutton, no need to unzip. </p>
<p>Sometimes you just hold on to these things too long, not the memories, but the things themselves plus the memories of what they meant. That’s where I’ve been recently. Holding on to those garments that made me feel strong and proud. The clothes that made me feel the most me. . . until they didn’t any longer. I waited, season after season. Fall and Spring catalogues cycled, recycled. And still they hung ghostly before my bed. I wondered, “When will I be the person who can wear those clothes again? When will I be her/me again?”</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I participated in yet another ritual cleansing, stuffed all those relics away into white garbage bags destined for Goodwill. And again I’ve started building, picking, buying, collecting. Starting again with a simple but bright orange mod-style dress, short sleeved, artfully loose, but clingy and friendly to the curves. And piece by piece I begin looking for myself again.</p>

<p><strong>“No Regrets” Cameo Necklace</strong> $30 <a href="http://fab.com/inspiration/no-regrets-cameo-necklace" target="_blank">fab.com</a></p>
<p>And to round out the wishlist of this weary-boned plodder<br />
A cameo necklace&#8230;just a little bit&#8230;odder. </p>
<p>Or. . .</p>
<p>Make me a drink or sing me a song<br />
Or hug me quite tightly or bring me along</p>
<p>On a sleigh ride adventure, or  to a wrestling fight,<br />
Just don’t leave me lonely on Xmas eve night. </p>
<p>Enjoy your roast beast, hold your weird family dear,<br />
Happy Idling times and I’ll see you next year!</p>
