										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year into DC&#8217;s reboot of their primary continuity, known as the New 52, <em>Idler</em> comics writer Matt Santori-Griffith and co-editor Gavin Craig are taking stock of some of the high points. This week, they talk about Wonder Woman&#8217;s revitalized mythology, and how family seems to be a central concern of the best titles of the New 52. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It strikes me as very curious that all of the books we chose to discuss for this month devoted to DC&#8217;s New 52 have central themes — if not dominating themes — about family. And not constructed families, but families bound by blood. Of all of them, <em>Wonder Woman</em> definitely hits this note the hardest.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Out of all the New 52 titles, <em>Wonder Woman</em> for me has been the biggest surprise, although maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be. As a member of DC&#8217;s &#8220;trinity,&#8221; Wonder Woman has often felt like the junior member, in sales or big memorable stories if not power or character. When I&#8217;ve dipped into <em>Wonder Woman</em> in the past, she&#8217;s felt like someone different almost every time. Which is fine for a character like the Joker, but not for a daughter of the Amazons. Giving her a family seems to have been a good move. It&#8217;s given her a center. And worthy antagonists.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Which is interesting, because I have the opposite reaction. I have read <em>Wonder Woman</em> every month for nearly 30 years and feel like we haven&#8217;t seen THAT much variety in her perspective over time. That&#8217;s not a dig at any previous run, but for me points to a certain preciousness about her character that the other two members of the Trinity aren&#8217;t as subject to. Azzarello and Chiang have taken a great departure from what has come before, and I am enjoying it if even just for what it implies about her iconic (or dare I say mythological) nature.</p>

<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yeah, I think what I&#8217;m talking about would be more an impression of inconsistency &#8212; probably growing out of a central uncertainty in the casting of Diana&#8217;s character. She&#8217;s normally been a character sort of torn between two worlds &#8212; Themyscira and the mortal world &#8212; but not entirely at home in either. Done well, that sort of tension can be really rich, but if a writer is uncertain about the character, or not totally comfortable in both those worlds, it can lead to weak storytelling. I love that Azzarello has basically cut that Gordian knot.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Well, Diana being torn between two worlds has been a factor over time at certain points (most notably during George Perez&#8217;s magnificent post-Crisis run on the title), but more often than not, her mother and sisters have been made inaccessible to her by a variety of plot devices. So many times, I have a hard time imagining the tension as that real any more. But the tension between being human and being godly? Now that&#8217;s a new one. And exceedingly interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The way that Azzarello has revealed Diana&#8217;s new history &#8212; not shaped from clay by her mother and given life by the gods, but the biological daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, a fact hidden from Diana in order to protect her (and Paradise Island) from Hera &#8212; has been a big part of what makes the title work. As you said when we were talking about <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/06/521-the-bat/">Bruce Wayne and the Court of Owls</a>, it&#8217;s a retcon, but it&#8217;s not just an abrupt change, it&#8217;s written as information that was hidden from Diana and the world for a reason, and we get to share in Diana&#8217;s readjustment to her new understanding of herself.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Right. And it&#8217;s funny, but other than a few minor details (not being able to fly until #12), I can&#8217;t reasonably think why Diana&#8217;s entire post-Crisis history can&#8217;t still be in play. Until we&#8217;re told otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> And that&#8217;s probably a big observation worth making about the New 52: For a continuity-altering reboot, it&#8217;s left room for a lot of great old stories to be able to carry forward &#8212; titles like <em>Batwoman</em> and <em>Batman Incorporated</em> are big obvious examples where the reboot affects almost nothing, but DC (at least in some places) has done an amazing job of letting writers take a character in a new direction in a way that&#8217;s still amazingly faithful to who they&#8217;ve been in the past. (Like <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/13/521-the-girl-most-likely-to/">Barbara Gordon</a>, for example.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I understand the frustration many DC Comics fans (and in particular long-time Wonder Woman fans) have experienced, but I also think we don&#8217;t have a lot of perspective on what&#8217;s being accomplished here yet. Being able to break from previous storylines in such a way that doesn&#8217;t necessarily negate anything, but allows the writers to pick and choose what aspects of a character to emphasize, really reinforces how legendary these icons are. Comic books are modern mythology, and like the different portrayals of the Greek gods (over centuries, but heck, even just over the last 20 years in <em>Wonder Woman</em>), there&#8217;s always another angle or interpretation to enjoy. Some will get revisited. Ultimately, they are all true.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> &#8220;Ultimately they are all true.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s exactly right. I think you really can&#8217;t undervalue what Azzarello has done in terms of recasting Diana&#8217;s place in the cosmos, especially since while it might seem to lend itself to criticism as character aggrandizement (&#8220;Oh great, not only is she an AMAZON, now she&#8217;s <em>Zeus&#8217;s daughter</em>.&#8221;), but there&#8217;s a way in which Diana has been sort of set apart from the general superhero universe. I&#8217;m really happy to see that she&#8217;s starting to show up in titles like <em>Batwoman</em>, but I think it&#8217;s no accident that she hasn&#8217;t had any guests in her own title. Characters like Bruce Wayne always seemed a bit uncomfortable on Olympus, but I almost have a hard time imagining someone like Apollo even deigning to take notice of him.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I had thought about the break from compartmentalization with the Batwoman/Wonder Woman team-up as a good thing almost exclusively from the <em>Batwoman</em> side, but it&#8217;s true in relation to Diana&#8217;s title as well. Re-reading <em>Wonder Woman</em> 1-12 as a set was pure joy, but the opportunity to see a little bleed over from the main DC Universe is tempting as well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily think of the recasting of Diana as Zeus&#8217; daughter is that prone to the criticism of aggrandizement as much as it has been offensive to those who preferred an exclusively female-centered origin for Diana&#8217;s birth and development.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Makes sense, although I&#8217;ve really appreciated the portrayal of the derision Diana got from at least some of the other Amazons. Even as the perfect Amazon, untainted by the touch of man, things aren&#8217;t perfect.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That actually speared my heart a little. &#8220;Clay.&#8221; Honestly, what a cruel name. But it is a little unbelievable that a nation of any human beings, exclusively female or not, could be so idyllic as to never resent their monarchy or the princess who everyone loves just a little bit more than each one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> No one wants a perfect sibling.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Of course, Diana certainly doesn&#8217;t have to worry about standing above her newfound siblings in the same way. It&#8217;s not a question in my mind that Diana is a better woman, person, or god than Strife or Apollo, but they certainly wouldn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Getting back to the question of family, I agree wholeheartedly that throwing Diana into the middle of a big, confusing, lumpy family with conflicting desires and shifting loyalties has been the single best storytelling move Azzarello could have made. I think that you&#8217;re right that a big part of what makes Diana&#8217;s story right now compelling is the way that all of her struggles have been given the urgency of blood relation, but I think that he&#8217;s doing something else as well. I was really happy that we got to run <a href="http://wp.me/p1KCPb-6W" target="_blank">our conversation about the various Robins</a> as an &#8220;outtake,&#8221; because it has a lot to do with what&#8217;s going on here. We talked a bit about the additional tension in Bruce and Damien Wayne&#8217;s relationship because he&#8217;s the first Robin, the first of Bruce&#8217;s many sons to be a blood relation. But it&#8217;s really important that while Damien&#8217;s blood relation means that Bruce feels responsible for Damien&#8217;s shortcomings in a way that he doesn&#8217;t for, say, Jason Todd, it&#8217;s also true that to Bruce and Alfred (and I think most of us) all of the Robins are Bruce&#8217;s sons. Ward, adoptee, or biological, they&#8217;re all family.</p>
<p>Now this is a really tough thing to try to portray &#8212; that is, family of choice or circumstance as not being lesser than biological or traditional family construction. There&#8217;s something Azzarello can do with the Greek gods that&#8217;s otherwise challenging (but not quite impossible) &#8212; he can create blood relations that actually do a better job of portraying the complexity and contingency of blood relation by taking advantage of the prolificacy of immortality, as well as its destruction of normative family relations based on age seniority.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I&#8217;ve been thinking about this blood versus constructed family thing a lot lately as well, because of <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/16/hopelessly-devoted/" target="_blank">my recent look at <em>Hopeless Savages</em></a>. There actually aren&#8217;t that many blood related families in comics. Lots of orphans. Many many constructed families that I hold extremely dear. But outside of the Fantastic Four, not many &#8220;families&#8221; come from requirement rather than choice. The Olympians are far more a family of requirement for Diana than one of endearment, and I don&#8217;t get the sense that that will ever change. However, it&#8217;s curious, because her strongest tie at the moment is to Zola, the woman who will bear her half-brother, and to whom she&#8217;d really not be related to in even the most generous of family trees. What is it about Zola&#8217;s predicament that compels such loyalty in Diana? I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s not about family or her situation at all. It&#8217;s that she needs help. Azzarello&#8217;s Diana is no different than any previous iteration. She is selfless and as she tells her uncle Hell, &#8220;I love everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, by the way, was the moment I lost any doubt about whether or not Azzarello gets Diana. If you understand that Diana simply loves everyone, you understand her everything.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Indeed. The entire world is family to Diana. Blood (in the traditional sense) doesn&#8217;t have much to do with it. She helps the one most in need of help. Zola perhaps even more than her child. On Olympus, everyone is family, and no one loves anyone. Diana is the mirror image of that. Except for Hephaestus! I love him. &#8220;No one loves himself more than Eros.&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;And I love [him] even more that that.&#8221; He&#8217;s the one character who could say that in this comic &#8212; the most traditional expression of paternal love &#8212; and I totally believe him.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10540" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/20/521-wonder-woman/eros/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/eros1.jpg" data-orig-size="640,248" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="eros" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/eros1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/eros1.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/eros1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=248" alt="eros" title="eros" width="640" height="248" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10540" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/eros1.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/eros1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=58 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/eros1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=116 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I agree. And Hephaestus illuminated Diana&#8217;s biggest failing as well when she attempted to liberate her Amazon brothers from their &#8220;slavery.&#8221; At the end of the day, Wonder Woman lives in a world of black and white. Moral greys don&#8217;t really factor in. Once decided on a course of action, she acts, and while that makes her an exceedingly strong super-hero, it produces a conundrum at times, particularly in regard to family.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m not always right.&#8221; Acting and not always being right is just about the perfect formula for good fiction. Or even better, drama, in the ancient Greek sense. As opposed to Strife&#8217;s <em>drama</em>, in the contemporary sense.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Upon re-reading, I absolutely adored that Strife was not a traditional villain, nor even much of an antagonist for Diana, but almost a big sister ruthlessly teasing her little sister.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Strife is great. She does nothing but tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Any thoughts on historical/mythological versus comic book literary influences for the Amazons?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Not a whole lot specifically, except that it&#8217;s another good example of drawing the best of old sources while not feeling limited by them. Kind of like the character design. Every mythological character in <em>Wonder Woman</em> feels like they&#8217;re totally in character, and how great is it that they&#8217;re not all just drawn as traditional chiseled-marble humans in togas? There are a lot of great reveals in <em>Wonder Woman</em>&#8216;s first year, but Poseidon&#8217;s full-page introduction (which is actually drawn by Tony Atkins) was astounding.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> There is something so&#8230; ugh, I don&#8217;t have the word&#8230; elementary about the standard comic book depiction of the gods. Poseidon&#8217;s reveal was definitely a highlight, but so too was that last image of Hell staring into his reflection before Diana shot him with Eros&#8217;s revolver. For as monstrous as some of them are, they too are weak and vulnerable.</p>

<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I love Hades/Hell. Drawing him as a small boy with an emo candle-wax obscured face is just perfect. He&#8217;s all hurt feelings and inadequacy.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I also loved that you never saw Aphrodite&#8217;s face when she appeared in issue 9, as if the comic book panel couldn&#8217;t adequately describe her beauty anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> You made the point about comic books being modern mythology, and I think the reverse is true as well. Myths were the comic books of their day &#8212; Homer&#8217;s vivid depictions of how spears destroyed people&#8217;s faces and knocked out their teeth as they died &#8212; and Azzarello and Cliff Chiang really letting their imaginations run wild on how the gods look as well as what they do is actually more faithful to the ancient myths than it would be to draw the gods as walking Greek statuary. After all, what have the gods been doing all these years? It&#8217;s exactly right that War has never had a moment of rest, and that Eros would never let himself look less than perfect, whatever perfect means at the particular time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a moment I caught re-reading #4 that I skimmed past on my first read. When Hera confronts Hippolyta, she asks Hippolyta how she could have betrayed her as another woman. Hera is interrupted by the arrival of the rest of the Amazons to protect their queen, but in the last moments that the two are alone, Hera asks &#8220;What did he say to make you love him? What can I do to make him. . .&#8221; She never finishes that sentence, but it&#8217;s clear that she&#8217;s asking Hippolyta what she can do to make Zeus love her. It&#8217;s heartbreaking. Again, the vulnerability behind the rage.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I felt the exact same thing. These gods are so fallible. The concern has been that Diana&#8217;s characterization has seemed weak (although that&#8217;s not one I personally subscribe to), but if anything, we&#8217;re starting to see a Wonder Woman who is so much more together than her brethren, even in her most vulnerable moments. And then, there&#8217;s her powers. The reimagining of Diana&#8217;s bracelets (which have not directly represented submission for her alone since pre-<em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>) as holding BACK her power, not simply adding to it, is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I think the key to Wonder Woman&#8217;s strength, especially compared to her family, is that she owns her vulnerability, her love. She doesn&#8217;t hide them under force like the rest of her family, which is why they&#8217;re each overwhelmed by their vulnerabilities. I love how Diana&#8217;s powers are still becoming clear to us and (mostly) to her. It wasn&#8217;t totally clear before #12 that she couldn&#8217;t fly, although she can apparently walk on water.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> So now we have a Wonder Woman whose power level is unknown. That&#8217;s more than a little exciting. So many years, debates have gone on about whether she is at Superman&#8217;s level or not. Who cares? This is an entirely different ballgame, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Exactly. I love how many times when we&#8217;ve asked specific detail or continuity questions, the answer has come back to &#8220;who cares?&#8221; I think you and I can obsess over detail with the best of them, but that&#8217;s been one of the big shortcomings of previous attempts to &#8220;clean up&#8221; continuity. It&#8217;s about telling a great story. You need to be consistent within the bounds of the story you&#8217;re telling, but that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> There have been a lot of cosmetic changes. Diana wields a much larger arsenal than just her lasso, frequently brandishing a sword. No longer an American resident, Diana lives in a London flat and frequents a metropolitan dance club. Perhaps reflecting this move, her costume has a much darker palette. For me, these items have really illuminated, rather than obscured, some of the things that I love dearly about Diana. Her wit. Her adaptability. Her kick-assness.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I think you hit on it when you talked about her iconic nature. As a big Batman geek, I&#8217;d be the first to say that what makes him so great isn&#8217;t the consistency of his continuity, it&#8217;s the way that he&#8217;s infinitely malleable and still totally recognizable. If DC has finally recognized that about Diana, then we&#8217;re in for some great comics, and Chiang and Azzarello had a big hand in that realization. It almost (almost) pains me to say it, but as good as Snyder&#8217;s <em>Batman</em> is, I&#8217;d put <em>Wonder Woman</em> up as the best title of the New 52, every single month.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Totally agree. It&#8217;s not my heart&#8217;s favorite (as <em>Batgirl</em> holds that precious space), but it is probably my brain&#8217;s. And frankly, it&#8217;s not that far behind on the heart, either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year into DC&#8217;s reboot of their primary continuity, known as the New 52, <em>Idler</em> comics writer Matt Santori-Griffith and co-editor Gavin Craig are taking stock of some of the high points. This week, at Gavin&#8217;s insistence, they&#8217;re starting things off by talking about <em>Batman</em> and <em>Batman and Robin</em>. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Jumping right in, have you noticed that both books start with Bruce being really sure of himself and his plan of attack (be it investigation into murder or raising a son) and both end the year with him not just realizing his own fallibility, but acknowledging the greater need for the family around him?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I think that making Bruce a bit more vulnerable, a bit more human, has been a really great move since the reboot. Even before the New 52, putting Dick Grayson in the cowl had already given us a Batman who struggled with his limitations, but it&#8217;s a big move to carry that over to Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It&#8217;s certainly part of the larger mission at DC this past year to humanize, not just youthen, its heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> It&#8217;s tempting to treat Batman as a section of the DC universe where not much has changed, but Scott Snyder in particular has shifted a lot of the assumptions that Batman operated under &#8212; even Dick&#8217;s history with the circus wasn&#8217;t what he thought it was.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> But what&#8217;s interesting about that is it&#8217;s not that the readers are getting a retrofitted history. We AND the characters are finding out new facts about the past that NEITHER of us knew before. Batman is as much in the dark as we are. Sure, the timeline is compressed, and minor details have been streamlined (*cough* Red Robin *cough*), but most of the assumptions we have had to date seem to bear out.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> And I think DC has done that pretty well. Compared to the various Crises, which were about streamlining or &#8220;fixing&#8221; continuity, I think the relaunch approach of preserving the core of what works, and shaking up the details has been really successful for storytelling. And the pacing has been magnificent. I remember &#8220;spoiling&#8221; the fact that Snyder was bringing Owlman into continuity in issue #10 of <em>Batman</em>, but that doesn&#8217;t even begin to sum up what Snyder did. It&#8217;s not just about re-introducing a somewhat obscure character, he really re-told Bruce&#8217;s family story (and Alfred&#8217;s) in a way that left everyone a bit shaken. Including me!</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I actually think what Snyder did to Alfred&#8217;s history was even more shocking than what he did to Bruce&#8217;s. In both books, Alfred is incredibly important, but that final story in <em>Batman</em> #11, where we get the truth about Jarvis Pennyworth&#8217;s demise, is so potent and makes Alfred much less of a caricature that he can sometimes become with less careful writers.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yeah, and to bring it back to your point about family, Alfred&#8217;s role as grandfather (of sorts) seems to be really important in both <em>Batman</em> and <em>Batman and Robin</em>. At times he seems to understand Damian Wayne a great deal better than Bruce does. I love the bit where he leaves two trackers on Damian so that Damian will think that he caught Alfred&#8217;s bit of sleight-of-hand.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That was brilliant. Bruce speaks of learning from 6 (not 4) mentors. I wonder if one of them is meant to be Alfred. But honestly, it makes sense that Alfred would understand Damian. He is his father&#8217;s son, and Alfred has already dealt with one hurt, scared 10 year-old Wayne son. Alfred has already done with Bruce exactly what Bruce needs to do with Damian, if Bruce can bring himself to realize it.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>  Coming back to the Court of Owls, the general presumption Bruce makes of his own infallibility isn&#8217;t just a character play (although it&#8217;s certainly interesting enough to be simply that). It also signals exactly how great a departure the New 52 is going to be for Batman moving forward. I feel like it&#8217;s easily been since the early 80s, maybe even the 70s, that we&#8217;ve had a Batman not just willing to admit he&#8217;s wrong, but most of the time, actually wrong. Even at his worst moments, say <em>Tower of Babel</em>, where he betrays all his friends, there&#8217;s still a moral high ground behind his mistake that makes it understandable. Here, though, he&#8217;s just plain wrong. It&#8217;s delightful, really.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I agree that it&#8217;s a great move, and long overdue. A Batman who wins every fight, who already knows everything is fundamentally uninteresting. There&#8217;s really just no way to tell stories about him. A Batman who finds himself having to look at his place in his city in an entirely new way, fighting an enemy who&#8217;d always been under his nose? That&#8217;s fascinating stuff. I love that Bruce actually has to return to the same house where he was trapped as a child to find the Court of Owls. It wasn&#8217;t that he was looking in the wrong place, it&#8217;s that he wasn&#8217;t ready to find them, and they weren&#8217;t ready to be found.</p>
<p>And I also think that Damian Wayne finally carving out his own place in the Bat-family has been really well done. Before the New 52, I wasn&#8217;t a big Damian fan. He just seemed like a bit of wish-fulfillment on Grant Morrison&#8217;s part, a cranky, violent Robin who allowed Morrison to flash-forward to his own take on who Batman should be. I think Tomasi in <em>Batman and Robin</em> has really given Damian room to both be the damaged angry person he is, but also found the insecure, vulnerable child that was always intended to be there, but that a lot of writers didn&#8217;t do a good job of conveying.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I think we saw flashes of that in Morrison&#8217;s <em>Batman and Robin</em>, but it never would have come out in the big brother/little brother dynamic that was Dick and Damian. Damian finally being confronted with having a relationship with his father, and vice versa, is a very distinctive premise upon which to set a book. It&#8217;s truly not Robin&#8217;s book any more than it is Batman&#8217;s. The &#8220;and&#8221; is really the star.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;ve said this before, but one of the things I most appreciate about Damian&#8217;s characterization is that he&#8217;s a ten year old kid who acts like a ten year old kid. Sure, he&#8217;s been trained by the best assassins in the world and has genes that could make Alexander look unambitious, but at his root, he doesn&#8217;t act the way an adult would. I find that very unusual for teen (or tween as the case may be) heroes. I can barely think of any that don&#8217;t just seem like mini-adults.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Indeed! I know you and I don&#8217;t always agree on Tim Drake, and he&#8217;s always been a wildly different character than Damian, in ways both good and bad. I think we&#8217;re starting to get some really interesting tracing of the differences between the various Robins, and Bruce&#8217;s different successes and failures with each.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Absolutely. Tim Drake, for example, is also the one who had a father and wanted a second one, when Damian never even got a chance at one until now. I can see how to a ten-year-old, that might seem greedy. And that&#8217;s what I think so many people who deride Damian are missing. He&#8217;s not a jerk for no reason. He&#8217;s a fucked up little kid with a crazy mother, a grandfather who wanted to steal his body, and a missing dad who dies the minute they meet. Duh.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The art on both titles has also just been outstanding. I really love the way that <em>Batman and Robin</em> gives its artwork space to do a lot of the storytelling. You have some really great or even iconic moments that are just images. I&#8217;m thinking of Damian killing the bat in #2.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Gleason&#8217;s art in <em>Batman and Robin</em> definitely has a more open feel to it than Capullo&#8217;s in <em>Batman</em>, although the latter certainly reflects the tightly wound existence that Bruce lives out.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <em>Batman</em> is SO text-heavy. It almost always works (I think #11 pushes it), but Snyder&#8217;s doing a lot of heavy lifting with the narration and dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> The monologue in <em>Batman</em> is strong. I don&#8217;t mind it so much because the art is crisp and every line just so well chosen. And honestly, I like a book that takes me more than 3 minutes to read. I spend a ton of money every month on these things. Breezing through a stack in 30 minutes is somewhat of a rip-off.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> So, what about Harper Row? Where does she fit in? And what about <em>Batman</em> #12?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <em>Batman</em> #12 is just extraordinary. Art, story, everything.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Here&#8217;s where my head was the day <em>Batman</em> #12 was released: I&#8217;m not sure I can even explain why I&#8217;ve been so especially sensitive to the news lately. It may have started with the midnight shooting at <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. Maybe it&#8217;s just the election cycle, but I&#8217;ve found myself getting tension headaches every time I read another hyper-conservative twist on either gay marriage or civil liberties or the lack of acknowledgement of the role race plays in media reportage. . . whatever. The final straw was the spokesperson for the American Family Association advocating that its members kidnap children from gay parented families in an act of liberty that would mirror the &#8220;Underground Railroad.&#8221; I was so angry and hurt I truly don&#8217;t know how I drove home from work without getting in an accident.</p>
<p>And then I read <em>Batman</em> #12.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, reading a comic where Batman kicks the ass of a bunch of gay bashers. It was moving. Telling the story in DC&#8217;s absolute top-selling book? Made me a little teary-eyed. That it wasn&#8217;t a media event (intended or not) that could be accused of cashing in? Got a little more emotional. But the part that finally made me actually shed tears was the portrayal of a sister so devoted to her brother, and so determined to stand proud for him, that she&#8217;d shave the word FAG in the back of her own head. And then she wanted to help Batman too. If she&#8217;s not a fricking hero already with one single issue, I don&#8217;t know who is.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I know you&#8217;ve done <a href="http://www.comicosity.com/crisis-of-epic-proportion-the-case-of-alan-scott/" target="_blank">some writing about Alan Scott</a> in <em>Earth 2</em> (and you constantly make me feel bad for not reading that title. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what I can give up to increase my comics budget), and there&#8217;s something about having both a headline-grabbing, totally visible mainstream gay character AND having a story like Harper and Cullen Row in <em>Batman</em> #12. <em>USA Today</em> isn&#8217;t going to cover it, but it&#8217;s every bit as visible, and it&#8217;s about the fact that DC does both, not one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That&#8217;s a really good point about their commitment to this area. DC gets a lot of shit for a lot of stuff, and I acknowledge that 30 years of reading them every week has made me into somewhat of an apologist when things go south for them in the PR department. But I can see how hard they&#8217;re trying, especially to reflect gay and lesbian issues in their comics. And it feels like it&#8217;s being handled very differently. I don&#8217;t know if it just seems more organic, but Cullen&#8217;s introduction seems far more natural than Terry Berg&#8217;s in <em>Green Lantern</em> all those years ago. I particularly enjoyed Cullen&#8217;s almost fanboy fawning over Tim Drake (and not even Red Robin in this case). It was cute, and how could that have been in a book 5 years ago?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yes! I became Cullen&#8217;s biggest fan when he started talking about Tim. FINALLY someone understands. I think there&#8217;s a real role for Harper Row to fill, especially if part of Snyder&#8217;s take is that Batman is more estranged from his city than he realizes. She&#8217;s literally on (and under) the ground. And the active Bat-family NEEDS some estrogen. Barbara Gordon and Kate Kane are doing great things, but the Batcave itself is starting to smell a bit like dude.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That&#8217;s an excellent point. I love the idea too that not every hero has to wear a costume in Gotham. And yes, that&#8217;s part of the reason, though, that I am surprised about her overwhelmingly positive fan reaction. I mostly expected the response to be, &#8220;But she&#8217;s not Cass or Stephanie.&#8221; Why do you think she resonated despite that?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Harper didn&#8217;t really make an impression on me until #12 (she really just has a brief cameo or two previously), but I&#8217;m not sure that Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown&#8217;s fan base necessarily overlaps with the general Bat fan base. That is, there are some vocal people who miss Cass and Steph, but there are a whole lot of Bat fans who don&#8217;t. And looking back, even in her cameo, Harper is self-possessed in a way that Steph in particular never was. Steph is a fuck-up who was just starting to find herself in Bryan Q. Miller&#8217;s <em>Batgirl</em> series. Harper has a sort of self-deprecation, but she also used a car battery and jumper cables as a defibrillator. You have to admit, that&#8217;s kind of cool. I love Cass and Steph, but Cass is stunted, and Steph, at her worst, is a loser. Harper is neither, which makes her something of a rarity as a possible female member of the Bat family.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That. Is an excellent way to put that &#8212; self-possessed. She doesn&#8217;t seem to have much self-doubt or self-consciousness, which makes her very attractive to me as a character. Now here&#8217;s a curious question: why do I find Harper so compelling, but other teen characters who act older than their natural age I find unrealistic? Is it because she&#8217;s female?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Well, exactly how old is Harper? She&#8217;s in high school but works for the city electric department</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> She seemed about 16-17 to me.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> She falls a bit into that mini-adult category, but an awesome story covers many flaws.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I find it fascinating that Snyder seems as interested in reincorporating past elements long left behind in the Batman legend as Morrison is.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> It&#8217;s a great move. So much was just left in the dustbin after the mid-1980s.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> And maybe that&#8217;s a good thought to end on. Does the New 52 enable this type of retro-history more than a continuity that seemingly tries to rationalize or retro-remove anything that doesn&#8217;t fit perfectly?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The DC universe is a rather uniquely cobbled-together thing, and <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7029" target="_blank">probably not particularly suited to a totally smooth, consistent history</a> (if such a thing is even possible for mass serial storytelling). I think it&#8217;s not an accident that we&#8217;re not seeing much effort within the new continuity to smooth all the edges. Rather than worrying about continuity in and of itself, it&#8217;s really useful to just free your writers every now and then, and I think that&#8217;s the big thing the New 52 has done.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It&#8217;s certainly paid off for Batman. While historical details may not have changed that much, the tenor of the books in this family has. We&#8217;re not seeing a god-like Batman anymore. Bruce is very much human, even in his most arrogant moments, and that has never been executed as well to date as Snyder and Tomasi are.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Bruce needed some reinvigorating, and even before the New 52, I think that&#8217;s what Morrison in particular tried to do. But Snyder and Tomasi have really pulled the best of what was good, and brought in some great new ideas of their own. I&#8217;m a big Batman fanatic regardless, but he&#8217;s worth reading now as a character with desires and failings. He&#8217;s someone you can tell stories about and not just around. Bruce, after all, is a bit of a jerk, and when you can acknowledge that, then things can really get cooking.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on writing. The visions are iconographic -- the graphemes it uses are representations of embodiment and embodied action, and like all representation, it operates by demanding interpretation. The revealed story -- the story communicated through the visions -- is perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous. Life, living cloth, both flora and fauna, emanate from the energy of the mountain. People begin to direct energy, first into greater cloths, and then into structures which use cloths as energy sources. The people attain great heights, and then the energy starts to flicker. There is a tearing of the cloth. New, terrible machines are built under storm and cloud. The world is covered in sand. A single traveler appears, and moves through the ruins of the world to the mountain." Read <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2w6">"Three meditations on <em>Journey</em>"</a> by Gavin Craig

The Gamers' Club is playing <em>Cave Story</em>. Read <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wG">"Let's get retro"</a> by Daniel J. Hogan, <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wJ">"Platform mechanics"</a> by Kevin Nguyen, and <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wX">"Jumping into story"</a> by Gavin Craig

"It’s easy to wonder if the Caps and the Canadiens might have been altogether better off keeping the coaches they started the season with. After all, Boudreau was just signed to a two-year contract with the Anaheim Ducks, so couldn't Ovechkin have gotten over himself? And I've seen Martin on some lists as a potential Hunter replacement for the Caps, just to make things weirder. There's obviously no way to know. Inevitably, more coaching switches will go down between now and next postseason, but these two organizations will be the teams to watch. Their ability to weather a revolving door of coaches -- and possibly players -- may help other general managers with their hiring and firing decisions, whether they know it or not. Or at least, a GM might think twice before firing a coach to try and stir the pot."

"<em>Farscape</em> was why my spouse and I bought a TiVo. It was a show we discovered not long after we got married and that we were soon watching faithfully. But we discovered after our babe was born in 2001 that live television watching wasn't compatible with baby minding, and we rediscovered the unreliabilty of taping shows on a VCR. We couldn't do without Moya and her crew, and so we bought a first-generation TiVo, along with a lifetime subscription to its services. We've been proselytizing the joys of TiVo ever since (we've upgraded to a recent model and have hacked that to increase its memory). But <em>Farscape</em> had disappeared from our lives for a while. It went off the air, and although I'm pretty sure we own it on DVD, I don't tend to remember to watch my DVDs. But with its appearance on Netflix Instant, nothing can come between me and Ka D'Argo again." Read <a href="http://wp.me/sZ58k-farscape">"Farscape: Soap in space"</a> by Sarah Werner.

"Since TECT, the machine to which humans had conceded the government of their lives, ordered Sandor Courane into exile on Planet D (which the colonists inevitably called Home), he had no choice but to go. And on Home, Sandor found respite from his failures on Earth (TECT had mercifully given him 3 chances: as a basketball player, a science fiction writer, and a factory worker) and a community whose work filled him with pride. But Sandor also discovered that on Home, there were two types of colonists: patients infected with a terrible fatal neurological disorder, and prisoners to take care of them as they forget everyone and everything they once loved. What caused D syndrome? Why would TECT let this happen?" Read <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2xp">"TECT Knows Best"</a> by Suzanne Fischer.]]></description>
