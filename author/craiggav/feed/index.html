										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d like to clear up a bit of a myth &#8212; you can actually follow either <em>Animal Man</em> or <em>Swamp Thing</em> without reading the other. Writers Jeff Lemire and Scott Snyder have clearly spent the first year of the two titles building a common world with a number of common elements and themes, but they each have their own plan. Together, the two titles considered together form a dark, rich tapestry, but they&#8217;re each outstanding titles on their own. You don&#8217;t have to read both <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em>, although I can&#8217;t imagine why you wouldn&#8217;t want to.</p>

<p>At first glance, Buddy Baker and Alec Holland don&#8217;t have much in common. Baker is a sometime actor and stuntman who has embraced his public role as Animal Man not just to fight crime, but to be an advocate for animal issues. He&#8217;s married with a son and a daughter, and while his acting career has never really taken off, he&#8217;s just starred in a little indie film which is garnering a some attention and even a hint of Oscar buzz. In the pages of <em>Animal Man</em>, there&#8217;s an ongoing contrast between the humble, salt-of-the-earth (I&#8217;m trying to avoid the phrase white trash) nature of the Baker family, and the way modern media occasionally intrudes on the story &#8212; the first page of the first issue of <em>Animal Man</em> is a faux interview with Buddy Baker from the deeply hip magazine <em>The Believer</em>, and most of the sixth issue consists of scenes from Baker&#8217;s indie film <em>Tights</em>, as viewed on Baker&#8217;s son&#8217;s smartphone while the family is on the run in their RV.</p>

<p>Alec Holland, on the other hand, is a renowned plant biologist who in the first issue of <em>Swamp Thing</em> is working in construction. He&#8217;s recently returned to life after a lab explosion years ago to find not only that his wife wasn&#8217;t so lucky, but that he shares memories with a monstrous superhero animated by a force known as the Parliament of Trees using what they were able to salvage of Holland&#8217;s personality after his death. The Parliament now wants Holland to become their champion himself as they had always intended, and he feels the unwanted pull of that destiny in both his waking hours and in his dreams.</p>
<p>But for all their differences, Baker and Holland have one thing in common. Their lives have been shaped and directed by forces that are beyond anything they had ever imagined, and the first year of each of their titles can be read as an extended cinematic pull back shot. In every issue, the frame expands a little, revealing a world bigger, deeper, stranger, and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In the New 52, Animal Man and Swamp Thing are revealed to be champions (&#8220;avatars&#8221;) for the constantly battling forces of animal and plant life, known as The Red and The Green, both of which oppose the embodied force of death known as The Rot. In times of balance, each of the three forces keeps the others in check. If things were in balance, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have much of a story, and both titles at the inception find themselves in a place where the way things are is far from the way things should be.</p>
<p>In <em>Animal Man</em>, artist Travel Foreman evokes this dislocation by creating a world of open, realistic but flattened spaces with bizarre, hyper-detailed intruders. (Steve Pugh largely takes over by issue #7, but maintains Foreman&#8217;s overall stylistic deisgn.) Buddy Baker and his family are pursued by a grotesque, distended group calling themselves The Hunters Three who can consume living beings and wear their skins. The Hunters are portrayed as occasionally struggling to fit within their assumed shapes, which become cartoonishly distorted when a hunter is distracted or fatigued. Nothing about the process is pleasant or pretty. &#8220;This will hurt very badly,&#8221; one of the hunters tells a victim as he is being eaten, &#8220;but I need your sssskin. . .&#8221;</p>

<p>The flatness of Buddy Baker&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; world is a vivid illustration of the new series&#8217; central revelation. While Baker has been empowered by the Red as the <em>de facto</em> champion of the animal world, he is only a placeholder. The untimely death of the Red&#8217;s previous avatar left them in need of a temporary replacement, so they granted some of the next avatar&#8217;s abilities to her father. Maxine Baker&#8217;s connection to the Red far exceeds anything Buddy Baker has ever experienced, and her nacent powers already far exceed his own. Maxine is also just four years old, and for all her power, far from able to protect herself from the Lovecraftian figures pursing her.</p>
<p>While Buddy Baker finds himself a smaller figure in a bigger world, a custodian more than a champion, then Alec Holland is precisely the opposite, the champion who was taken from the Green and has now returned. Holland, however, wants nothing to do with the destiny the Green so fervently desires that he embrace, and he finds himself trying to prune back the tendrils the Parliament of Trees have wrapped around his soul. Fittingly, Yanick Paquette&#8217;s art is lush, flowing, and sometimes oppressively detailed. In the second and third issues, Holland meets a kindred spirit in Abigail Arcane, a woman whose family has a deep connection to the Rot, and who has a history with the Alec Holland simulacrum that was the previous Swamp Thing. Holland finds himself irresistibly drawn to Abigail, defending her life against both the Rot seeking to reclaim her, and the Green&#8217;s demands that he destroy her. </p>

<p>In different hands, we might have had two strong but unrelated titles, the interim hero and the reluctant champion with their very different stories in their own separate worlds. Linking the two together is a brilliant idea which has been executed with what I&#8217;m certain was no little effort and a great deal of skill. The star-crossed lovers and the father defending his progeny are both classic, even primal stories, but together they form a rich and unexpected epic about blood and family, and creating a future beyond what is encoded within history and genetics.</p>
<p>Because of this, <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em> are comics about heroism and not just superheroes. Both titles have seen, groundbreaking work in the past (as written by Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, respectively), but they existed for all practical purposes in their own pocket narrative universes. With their New 52 incarnations, Snyder and Lemire have been able to bring themes (and a level of quality) more often found in indie comics or imprints like Vertigo to the mainstream DC universe. It&#8217;s an effort whose first fruits are just beginning to mature, but the ground is rich, and there&#8217;s the promise of even better to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past week, I visited the Smithsonian Museum of American Art&#8217;s &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221; exhibit for a second time, and I&#8217;ve read so much criticism of the exhibit that I&#8217;d like to start off with what it does right.</p>
<p>Having video games on featured display at a major U.S. art museum is undeniably cool, and a welcome rejoinder to Roger Ebert&#8217;s infamous assertion that <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html" target="_blank">&#8220;video games can never be art.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the single best part of &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221; is the room where visitors actually get to play. Five games &#8212; <em>Pac Man</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, <em>Myst</em>, and <em>Flower</em> &#8212; are set up on huge, wall-sized screens.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also, for lack of a better word, cool to see so many actual iconic consoles gathered into one place. Even when it&#8217;s not plugged in, the SNES, for one, is a beautiful example of industrial design.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, that&#8217;s the best of what I have to say. To be fair, when an entire medium &#8212; dozens of consoles and systems, thousands of games, millions of players &#8212; is crammed into three medium-sized gallery rooms, it&#8217;s going to be almost impossible to avoid finding fault. Amazing games are going to be left out. History will be simplified, glossed over, or ignored. Even the gameplay has to be limited &#8212; each game resets after a few minutes in order to allow as many people as possible a chance to take a turn.</p>
<p>At IGN, <a href="http://games.ign.com/articles/122/1221949p1.html" target="_blank">Michael Thomsen criticizes &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221;</a> for focusing on games produced by corporate developers rather than more individual works from people like Mary Flanagan, Michael Mateas, and Andrew Stern, whose games might be harder to find, and which arguably focus more on the expression of an idea or a unique mechanic than finding a commercial audience. This focus, according to Thomsen, ends up working against the argument that video games belong in The Museum of American Art. &#8220;The Art of Video Games has ignored the games that called themselves art without apology,&#8221; and ends up &#8220;fail[ing] to capture what is beautiful in [the games that were included], and how much they resonate with the spirit of all the other works displayed in the museum.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/26/2972326/the-art-of-video-games-review" target="_blank">T.C. Sottek at The Verge</a> observes that &#8220;tech[nology] plays a dominating role in the exhibit.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Art of Video Games doesn&#8217;t talk back much to the viewer or take risks with its point of view. There is no overriding thesis here except for perhaps the obvious notion that games are a new and unique kind of art. As such, it doesn’t prompt many critical questions about the cultural or societal role of video games, or really explore the boundaries that decide what makes a game art as opposed to, say, mere entertainment.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to agree. The exhibit doesn&#8217;t really focus on change or development in video games other than graphics &#8212; the move from 8-bit games to the &#8220;bitwar&#8221; era, for example, and the shift from 2-dimensional worlds to three dimensions &#8212; and simply doesn&#8217;t have space for anything more than a blanket assertion that narrative in video games is much richer and deeper now that so many more tools are available to game developers.</p>
<p>Since the exhibition doesn&#8217;t really have the space or the tools to talk about what makes a successful narrative, I&#8217;ll settle for expressing my skepticism that better graphics or more powerful processors have any necessary connection to better narratives, and conclude instead with two more concrete criticisms.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m disappointed that &#8220;The Art of Video Games&#8221; seems to focus on video games as a phenomenon of the home console or PC to the exclusion of public play. This ignores both the fact that home consoles have historically often served to run low-powered imitations of games designed for public arcades, and the current proliferation of online play. This is especially frustrating when the failure to include some version or acknowledgement of the arcade in the exhibit&#8217;s play room seems like such a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Second, I can&#8217;t help coming away with the feeling that an art museum is the wrong venue for an exhibition on video games. Video games have always been so much more than the sum of their hardware and code, and putting them in a museum devoted to the visual arts must necessarily nudge games into occupying the position of being a thing to look at. While, say, a book or a chess set could well merit inclusion in an art museum as an object of physical beauty and artistic design, putting either on a wall or behind glass excludes some fundamental aspect of their artfulness. A book that cannot be read is not literature, and a chess board that is not in use cannot convey the history or beauty of the game of chess at play.</p>
<p>Books have libraries. Chess has clubs, tournaments, and tables set up in parks and other public places all over the world. If we want to get games to be taken more seriously as an art, maybe we need to make our play more visible and accessible, and create spaces where that can happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While summer reading lists tend to put one in mind of trashy paperbacks stashed away in canvas bags for beach reading, not many of us will spend the entire summer in a folding chair. Thus, a good set of summer reading suggestions will include options suitable for a variety of situations and pursuits. Whether you&#8217;re soaking up summer rays, trapped inside by a sudden summer storm, or looking for a different kind of summer getaway, this list should have you covered. (You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>
<p><strong>For those hot summer days:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10109" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/heat/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg" data-orig-size="271,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="heat" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=203" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=271" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&#038;h=150" alt="Heat" title="heat" width="101" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10109" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=202&amp;h=298 202w" sizes="(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px" /> Other than <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/18/quit-cooking-start-reading/">Jill&#8217;s Kolongowski&#8217;s recommendation</a> of Julia Child&#8217;s <em>My Life in Paris</em> (which is both an amazing book and actually about a lot more than just Child&#8217;s life in Paris), the most enjoyable food book you can add to your summer reading list is Bill Buford&#8217;s <em><strong>Heat: An Amateur&#8217;s Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany</strong></em>. Formerly Fiction Editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>, Buford leaves his magazine job to learn about cooking in Mario Batali&#8217;s restaurant Babbo shortly before the release of <em>The Babbo Cookbook</em>. It&#8217;s a time when the restaurant is both preparing for fresh critical scrutiny and tweaking the menu to move beyond the soon-to-be-published set of recipes. No one in the kitchen has the time or patience for a rank amateur in their midst, and Buford has to make the most of it &#8212; which he does with humor, humility, and aplomb. <em>Heat</em> is a welcome counterpoint for those of us put off a bit by the overwhelming bravado of Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s <em>Kitchen Confidential</em>, and things just get better when Buford heads off to Italy to study with some of Batali&#8217;s mentors.</p>
<p><strong>For those stormy summer nights:</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s actually some really amazing stuff in even the biggest mainstream comic books right now. Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo&#8217;s work on <em>Batman</em> is unbelievable (and in a different venue, I&#8217;d have written that word in all-caps AND bold AND italics), Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang&#8217;s work on <em>Wonder Woman</em> is everything the New 52 promised to do, a magnificent re-imagining of a classic (but too-often underutilized) character &#8212; the character designs alone are worth cover price &#8212; and Gail Simone&#8217;s <em>Batgirl</em> is a remarkable and psychologically gripping take on Barbara Gordon that manages to preserve most of what was wonderful about Simone&#8217;s time writing the character as Oracle. (This is high praise coming from me. I was really disappointed that <a href="http://gavinjcraig.com/2011/08/21/goodbye-batgirl-hello-batgirl/" target="_blank">DC was abandoning</a> <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2009/08/quick-break.html" target="_blank">Stephanie Brown</a> in order to bring back the Barbara Gordon Batgirl, although, in fairness, I might just be the only person in the world who feels that way.)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10116" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/batman-and-son/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg" data-orig-size="419,644" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Batman-and-Son" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=195" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=419" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&#038;h=150" alt="Batman and Son" title="Batman-and-Son" width="97" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10116" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&amp;h=150 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=194&amp;h=298 194w" sizes="(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px" /> But, assuming that you might not be the sort of person who visits a comic shop every month, let me recommend Grant Morrison&#8217;s current run on <em>Batman, Inc.</em> as the culmination of a story he&#8217;s been telling since 2006. Morrison is a writer whose work actually often reads better when it&#8217;s been collected into a trade volume where the reader can pick up all the visual and story clues he weaves together from month to month (which can often seem a bit obscure when you&#8217;re only getting 20ish pages at a time, with 30 or more days between installments). Morrison&#8217;s saga starts with <em><strong>Batman and Son</strong></em> (with a jaw-dropping first issue where Batman fights ninja man-bats in a Roy-Lichtenstein-inspired pop art exhibition), and continues in <em><strong>The Black Glove</strong></em> (with art by the no-less-than-absolutely-brilliant J. H. Williams III), <strong>Batman R.I.P.</strong>, <em><strong>Batman &amp; Robin Vol. 1: Batman Reborn</strong></em> (where Dick Grayson steps into the cape and cowl), <em><strong>Vol. 2: Batman vs. Robin</strong></em>, <em><strong>Vol. 3: Batman &amp; Robin Must Die</strong></em>, and finally, the pre-New 52 <strong><em>Batman, Incorporated</em></strong>. (Completists will include <em>Final Crisis</em> and <em>The Return of Bruce Wayne</em>, but you can get away without reading those two. Just know that Bruce Wayne dies, sort of, and then comes back.)</p>
<p>Like many &#8220;difficult&#8221; writers, the trick to reading Morrison is to just keep going. With Morrison in particular, you&#8217;ll get totally lost if you worry about making sense of everything. I think the big secret is that Morrison spends a lot less time worrying about whether he makes sense than building and keeping up a sort of narrative cadence and momentum. When you really get into him, you don&#8217;t so much read as excavate, digging up all the things that you didn&#8217;t realize were there at first, and finding yourself pulled into the most neglected and maligned corners of a character&#8217;s history, suddenly shown (well, skillfully retconned) to have been the most interesting and important thing all along.</p>
<p>But, having said that, you don&#8217;t need to know anything about Grant Morrison or even Batman to pick up <em>Batman and Son</em>. (Although, good luck putting it down once you&#8217;ve started.)</p>
<p><strong>For getting away from it all:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10122" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/journeycollectorsed/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg" data-orig-size="277,350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="journeycollectorsed" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=237" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=277" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=118&#038;h=150" alt="Journey Collector&#039;s Edition" title="journeycollectorsed" width="118" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10122" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=118&amp;h=150 118w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=236&amp;h=298 236w" sizes="(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px" /> Being the sort of person who tends to talk about narrative video games, I&#8217;m going to recommend a game rather than a book on games. (If you&#8217;re looking for a fun AND smart book on video games, there&#8217;s always Tom Bissell&#8217;s <strong><em>Extra Lives</em></strong>, which <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2010/06/diary-of-casual-gamer-2-confessions-and.html" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>, or you can do what I do and crib from <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/" target="_blank">The Brainy Gamer</a>&#8216;s bookshelf.)</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t played it yet, go download Thatgamecompany&#8217;s <em><strong><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/18/three-meditations-on-journey/">Journey</a></strong></em> right now. There&#8217;s a collector&#8217;s edition disc coming out at the end of August (which will also include <em>Flower</em> and <em>Flow</em>), but don&#8217;t wait. Hell, download it now AND buy the disc in August. Anything to encourage people to make more games like this.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, <em>Journey</em> will only be available for the Playstation 3, so my apologies if you don&#8217;t own one. For everyone else, we can count <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect-3/Extended_Cut_Endings">the new <em>Mass Effect 3</em> endings</a> as narrative, right? Just for the summer?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finished <em>Cave Story</em> just minutes before I sat down to write this, so the impressions I&#8217;ll be sharing are fresh, but not entirely settled.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I feel like I just blew up a lot of shit. At the end, you have to fight Misery, The Doctor, The Doctor after the red crystal takes over his body, and then the Core after the Doctor, um Red Crystal Doctor, um, a bunch of red bubbles possess the Core AND Misery AND Sue.</p>
<p>Basically, you just shoot a lot.</p>
<p>And, weirdly, it didn&#8217;t feel like the toughest fight of the game. I had a much harder time with the Dragon Sisters on my second trip through the Egg Corridor (after the big collapse). Of course, that&#8217;s not a complaint. I am, in all honesty, ready to be done. I&#8217;m happy with the game, and the experience as a whole, but I&#8217;m ready to move on to something else, too.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot new to say about the narrative &#8212; I think it&#8217;s a compliment to <em>Cave Story</em> that most of the narrative value is embedded throughout the game rather than coming in one big burst at the end. Destroying and escaping from the floating island felt like a culmination rather than a revelation, although there are a few good additional bits if you watch the credits. Sue, for example, gets turned back to a human, but it doesn&#8217;t stick.</p>
<p>The most powerful moment for me was actually the quick flash to <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/06/cave-story-small-but-not-simple/">Curly Brace</a>, still inactive and locked in the core.</p>
<p>In fact, saving Curly Brace is the one thing that could drag me through the game a second time, although I think there&#8217;s a good argument to be made for <em>not</em> going back to save her. While it&#8217;s almost assumed that a good game is one that&#8217;s designed for replay value &#8212; BioWare is famous for this, and actually puts messages on loading screens encouraging the player to start a second playthrough and make different choices &#8212; <em>Heavy Rain</em> director David Cage has stated in interviews that <a href="http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/698809/quantic-dreams-david-cage-play-heavy-rain-several-times-kill-the-magic-of-it/">he hopes that players make a single trip through his game</a>.</p>
<p>These competing desires are expressions of different theories of game narrative experience, both, interestingly, hinging on design architectures which attempt to make player choices matter. BioWare is, in effect, saying &#8220;we put a lot in this game, and you owe it to yourself to see the various outcomes your choices can lead to. See how characters react differently, find all the easter eggs, do everything.&#8221; The evidence, in this case, that choices matter comes from experiencing different outcomes, and the implied argument is that if a player is only going to play a game once, then they may as well go buy a game with a more linear, game-directed storyline. (Like maybe <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em>. To which I say, &#8220;Touché, BioWare. Touché.&#8221;)</p>
<p><em>Heavy Rain</em>, while seeming to be similarly focused on crating meaningful player choices, actually takes an entirely different approach as to what it means for a choice to matter. Instead of encouraging the player to go back and find out what could have happened differently, the game instead focuses on creating a more seamless experience.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> In fact, without a second playthrough (or some digging online), it&#8217;s not entirely clear at the end of the game what exactly could or should have gone differently, and one of the things I admire about the game is the way that players who reach wildly different endings can leave the game with the impression that they achieved the &#8220;best&#8221; ending.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, while part of me wants to save Curly Brace, her loss was the most affecting narrative moment in <em>Cave Story</em> for me, and I&#8217;m not totally sure I want to defeat that.</p>
<p>So what do you say, Daniel and Kevin? Will you be playing again? Or was the first trip enough (or more than enough)?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a name="note1"></a>1. I use the phrase &#8220;more seamless&#8221; rather than &#8220;seamless&#8221; intentionally. There&#8217;s a whole column (at least) in <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s seams and joins, but I&#8217;m supposed to be talking about <em>Cave Story</em>, so I&#8217;ll leave it there for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to my notes, I&#8217;ve spent a little more than six hours playing <em>Cave Story</em> so far, and I&#8217;m not quite done. Speaking of notes, while spending six hours in a game isn&#8217;t particularly notable &#8212; if this were a JRPG, I&#8217;d still just be getting my toes wet &#8212; the fact that those six hours have generated <em>30 mini-notebook pages of notes</em> might be a better measure of the way this game has worked its way into my head.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not sure exactly how everything is going to end up, but the game has me convinced that every little thing matters, every character, every snippet of information I&#8217;m given in conversation with an NPC, and it is perhaps exactly the smallness of the game that has me paying such close attention. In big open world JRPGs, there&#8217;s so much information, and so much world that most of it has to be drawn in broad strokes. The things that matter can&#8217;t be subtle, and while the individual corners may be drawn in great detail, you can often leave most of that behind as you move on. In <em>Cave Story</em>, everyone knows everyone else, and things can&#8217;t help but get a little incestuous. There are only six Mimiga living in Mimiga village. You fight Balrog again and again, and when you get to the Sand Zone and meet Jenka, you find out that even though she&#8217;s (mostly) on your side, she&#8217;s on (mostly) friendly terms with Balrog and has even worked with him in the past.</p>
<p>The world, in <em>Cave Story</em>, isn&#8217;t large enough for impermeable boundaries to be drawn, and that&#8217;s really striking. The bad guys (except for maybe the Doctor) aren&#8217;t completely bad. The good guys aren&#8217;t simplistic selfless paragons. Sue, for example, is a bit of a jerk, who has alienated most of the Mimiga Village except, it seems, Toroko. King, the leader of Mimiga Village, locks up Sue after you find her to hand her over to the Doctor in hope of rescuing Toroko (who was mistaken for Sue and kidnapped by Balrog). Jenka doesn&#8217;t really want to help you destroy the red flowers, because that would mean giving you access to them, so she gives you busywork finding her dogs, which ends up allowing the bad guys to come and take the flowers instead.</p>
<p>For such a small game in such a small world, everyone&#8217;s motivations are complex, and often end up having unintended consequences. (Kind of like <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/23/cave-story-the-zig-zag-world/">the physical navigation</a>, the story has you double back, and double back again.) That, to me, is pretty close to the definition of good writing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also really happy that <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/05/cave-story-just-some-robot-i-used-to-know/">you brought up Curly Brace</a>, Daniel, as I found myself surprisingly affected by the way she left the story. Cave Story actually has a lot of death &#8212; so far I&#8217;ve lost King, the Professor, and I actually had to kill Toroko, which was pretty harsh &#8212; but I might end up thinking of Curly Brace as my Aeris. After defeating the Core, the room fills with water, leaving the player nowhere to go for air. You lose consciousness, and then wake up in Curly Brace&#8217;s air bubble, with Curly motionless beside you. If you try to talk to Curly, you&#8217;re told that there&#8217;s no reply. If you examine your inventory, you have Curly&#8217;s air tanks. There&#8217;s no cutscene that shows the transfer. There&#8217;s no big moment where you see Curly&#8217;s decision to sacrifice herself. You simply run out of air, and when you wake up, she&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p>I think this is actually a brilliant immersive narrative move, as it leaves the player to reconstruct &#8212; and absorb &#8212; what has taken place. As you noted, Daniel, the player has to decide to walk away, and there&#8217;s nothing in-game telling you whether that&#8217;s the right decision or not. You have to make a choice based on incomplete information and live with the consequences, especially when the blast door seals shut behind you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a real &#8220;wow&#8221; moment, and a welcome reminder of what games can do with narrative, even without flashy graphics or cinematic cutscenes. (I&#8217;m going to leave the issue of the Tow Rope to the side for now, but I&#8217;d be happy to return to it next week if you want, since it ties into some other interesting elements of <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s game design.)</p>
<p>So, onward, one last time, to boss battles and the end!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last week, I promised that this week&#8217;s post would be about narrative in Cave Story, but I&#8217;m going to put that off a bit, in part because the game is doing a great job of doling out the story bit by bit in ways that are keeping me interested as a player, and making me&#160;&#8230; <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/23/cave-story-the-zig-zag-world/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/17/cave-story-jumping-into-story/">Last week</a>, I promised that this week&#8217;s post would be about narrative in <em>Cave Story</em>, but I&#8217;m going to put that off a bit, in part because the game is doing a great job of doling out the story bit by bit in ways that are keeping me interested as a player, and making me feel that I&#8217;m not really going to be able to say anything substantial until I can talk about the beginning, middle, and the end all at once. Right now, I know that I&#8217;m a robot left over from a war 10 years ago in which people attacked an island and its Mimiga inhabitants. Backed into a corner, the Mimiga ate certain red flowers, and became vicious fighting machines. Now, there are few Mimiga and fewer robots, an evil doctor who wants to exploit the Mimiga, and a good professor who wants to stop him. The whys and wherefores are still up in the air, but it&#8217;s becoming clear that everyone knows everyone else. Well, except for me, that is.</p>
<p>So instead I&#8217;d like to continue to talk about the ways in which the game mixes RPG and 2D platformer mechanics &#8212; primarily how a strikingly simple design choice serves to open up what would otherwise be a fairly linear world. In the 8-bit platforming world which is my (admittedly outdated) primary point of reference, games largely ask the player to navigate in one direction, often from left to right. The basic model would be, of course, <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/11/18/mario-gets-old/">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, which doesn&#8217;t even let you backtrack once the screen has scrolled to the right, but even when games like <em>Castlevania</em> include vertical and right-to-left elements in their level design, there&#8217;s usually a specific forward direction at any given time, and it&#8217;s rare for a game to ask you to retrace your steps.</p>
<p>This might be one of the most brilliant components of the 2D platform game &#8212; particularly in systems with severe technical limitations (like an 8-bit console), the 2D platform game architecture creates a perpetual feeling of active progress. The game, when played, is in constant motion, and that motion is always directed toward a specific end. Thus, as long as the player is in motion, they can be confident that they&#8217;ll eventually reach the goal. The game may include rewards for exploration &#8212; hidden power-ups, warp zones, or bonus areas &#8212; but even a new player can just keep moving forward and progress through the game.</p>
<p><em>Cave Story</em>, on the other hand, pushes the player back and forth within a level like no other 2D platformer I&#8217;ve ever played. I&#8217;ve created a map below of the path I followed to complete the Bushlands level (known in some versions of the game as the Grasslands). [Click on the map for a larger version.]</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll note that in addition to all of the smaller back-and-forths, the game requires the player to return to the very beginning of the level <em>at least three times</em>. While the level largely follows a progressive back-and-forth &#8212; that is, you could basically divide the level in half, and the player is required to thoroughly explore the first half, and then can largely move on to thoroughly explore the second half &#8212; but then the game violates this neat division when it makes the player return to the beginning to fetch charcoal as a bomb component.</p>
<p>The effect of all this, at least in my play, was to make the area much more of a map (in RPG terms) than a level (in 2D platformer terms). Rather than simply being able to progress (and then return to the teleporter after completing the level), I had to continue to re-explore, and continue to converse with non-player characters (NPCs), just like returning to a town after defeating a major monster, accomplishing a specific goal, or acquiring new items in an RPG. In fact, the player&#8217;s relationships with NPCs in Cave Story are more dynamic than in many 40-hour RPGs I&#8217;ve played.</p>
<p>And, in all honesty, <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> could learn a thing or two from <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s level design. (Too often, running around in <em>Final Fantasy XIII</em> is like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> without the jumping. Ugh.)</p>
<p>So, story next week, I promise, and I&#8217;m hoping to look back on how the robot works as a blank slate/player identification character compared to <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/15/earthbound-taking-dads-advice/">Ness from <em>EarthBound</em></a>. (My initial take is that the robot works a lot better, but I need to do some noodling as to why and how.)</p>
<p>Thus far, we know that <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/22/cave-story-power-up/">Daniel is enthusiastic about <em>Cave Story</em>&#8216;s power-ups</a>, and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/16/cave-story-platform-mechanics/">Kevin is a bit skeptical about the jumping mechanics</a> (which is a pretty big problem for a platformer). I&#8217;m curious to know, though, on the whole how is the game working for the two of you? What genre would you cram it into? What, as you head towards the end, would it take to make or break the game for you?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe that we wrap up next week! Well, onward! (And maybe back again.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a sojourner in a strange land. I started alone, climbing a sand dune to catch my first glimpse of a mountain with a brilliant light glowing at its peak. As I walked toward the mountain, I encountered a glowing mark which wrapped itself around my neck and gave me the ability to float through the air. I found living scraps of fabric which carried me to a platform where I closed my eyes and saw a figure in white.</p>
<p>That figure would return as I moved forward to show me the story of the world and the people who came before me.</p>
<p>There is a balance every narrative game has to find between what the game gives you, and what it leaves for you to find. My first trip through the game was carried almost entirely by what was given. There was the experience of the world as I traveled through it, and there was the story of the world as revealed in the visions/cutscenes between levels. Every vision showed a little bit of where I had been, a little bit of where I was to go next, and a little bit of what had happened. It&#8217;s brilliantly difficult to be more specific than that, as the visions are images entirely free of text.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on writing. The visions are iconographic &#8212; the graphemes it uses are representations of embodiment and embodied action, and like all representation, it operates by demanding interpretation. The revealed story &#8212; the story communicated through the visions &#8212; is perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous. Life, living cloth, both flora and fauna, emanate from the energy of the mountain. People begin to direct energy, first into greater cloths, and then into structures which use cloths as energy sources. The people attain great heights, and then the energy starts to flicker. There is a tearing of the cloth. New, terrible machines are built under storm and cloud. The world is covered in sand. A single traveler appears, and moves through the ruins of the world to the mountain.</p>
<p>All of this is recorded. All of this is shown. None of it is explained. None of it has meaning independent of the traveler and the player&#8217;s experience. The traveler reconstructs the story by moving to a place in the world where a new chapter can be told. While the story, like all stories, is dependent on an imagined past, the play itself re-creates the story from the very first play. Without the traveler, without the reader, without the player, the writing is just an encoded possibility, a hope for a story. Every book, every game, every story is a ghost, a trace, a breath waiting for a body to enliven.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a companion. I was initially indifferent to others. The game has a trophy given when the player encounters 10 other players within the game. I earned this trophy on my first playthrough, as I moved forward and left other players behind. The second time, however, I met a traveler in a white robe.</p>
<p>Unlike most games with online multiplayer functionality, <em>Journey</em> doesn&#8217;t give players a way to talk to each other using voice or text. Instead, you can press a button to make a noise (which varies in tune with the game&#8217;s soundtrack) and create a single luminescent glyph.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on language. Because you can &#8220;talk&#8221; quietly or loudly by tapping the button lightly or holding it down with greater pressure, the game&#8217;s single hailing action can be incredibly expressive. I soon realized that the other traveler was calling my attention to places in the world I should explore. I found new ruins, hidden flowers, and secret glyphs which added to the story told in the visions. We had a way to acknowledge each other, to keep track of each other, and, most interesting of all, to chatter. Sometimes our speech had a clear purpose &#8212; &#8220;Come over here!&#8221; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; &#8220;Can you see me?&#8221; &#8212; but sometimes it was more a way to share excitement, or nervousness, or wonder. That is, it was a conversation in which clear communication was taking place, but in which that communication was entirely indifferent to individual words. It was a striking reminder of how much of a conversation is carried by tone and context rather than grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>As we moved through the world, the traveler taught me, and I was able to say thank you. In the moments of greatest beauty, we sang to each other. We were not only acknowledging each other, but acknowledging the world, and participating in it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I returned to <em>Journey</em> after my two complete playthroughs for a number of smaller, partial attempts. After the game is completed, the end of the first, tutorial level becomes a gateway where the player can jump to any of the later levels, rather than having to play the whole game in order. I collected the glowing symbols I had missed. I found the final hidden glyphs. I earned a white robe of my own. I tried and failed to take on the role of teacher.</p>
<p>So the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I put the robe away. I gave up the external signs of experience, and simply entered the world again.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on humility. While the story is dependent upon the player as a reader, an actor, a participant, the world itself endures unchanged. In most games, replay value is measured by variability of outcome &#8212; different choices resulting in a different story, different actions leading to a higher score. <em>Journey</em> has no score, and the world, the symbols, the glyphs, the visions, and the outcome are the same every time. You may approach the mountain alone or with a companion, clothed in brown or white, with a long flowing scarf or with almost no scarf at all. The mountain always strips all of these things away. The end is always the same.</p>
<p>And yet <em>Journey</em> is the only video game I can think of which I&#8217;ve played from beginning to end three times.</p>
<p>And the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I met a traveler. Somehow, I was better as a guide in the brown robe instead of the white, and I showed my companion the better paths. As we approached the mountain, in the final wind and snow, we were separated, and I did something I had never done before. I waited. When my companion was blown from the path, I sat in one place so that she could climb back and we could finish the journey together. Even then, somehow, she got ahead of me without my having seen her, and I found myself rising to catch up. I&#8217;m still not sure if I was mistaken somehow about her having lost the path, or if I was inattentive, or if she found a new way. None of these things seems likely, but I know for certain that we were separated and found each other further ahead. My patience, apparently, was nothing compared to my companion&#8217;s, as she waited for me to finish waiting for her. We entered the mountain together, to begin again, alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I saw the world.</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I learned the language.</p>
<p>The third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was part of the world.</p>
<p>I may yet return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Kevin, you make me nervous when you talk about Daniel as being <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wJ">&#8220;100 years old.&#8221;</a> I&#8217;m the old man of the bunch, after all, and if anyone ever goes back to those first <a href="https://idlermag.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii/">Final Fantasy VII</a> posts and figures out how old that actually is, I might get my game columnist license revoked.</p>
<p>Anyway, before we get too far into a &#8220;who&#8217;s older than whom&#8221; argument, let me say that I&#8217;m digging the choice of <em>Cave Story</em> as our Gamers&#8217; Club game. I&#8217;m sometimes a bit jealous of the world of indie or other unusual downloadable games that exist in the PC world or on the XBox Live Arcade service. I do have Steam installed on my Mac, but it&#8217;s old and underpowered, and I&#8217;ve been burned before, spending hours downloading a game only to find that my lappy couldn&#8217;t even open it. So I&#8217;m blissfully happy to not only be able to get <em>Cave Story</em> on WiiWare, but to have something to do with my woefully underused Wii and an excuse to pull my <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/29/in-control/">WaveBird</a> out of storage. (I&#8217;m a little bit put off that the game is $12 on WiiWare when it&#8217;s only $10 on Steam, but I&#8217;ll get over it.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played about an hour and a half of <em>Cave Story</em> so far, and already it&#8217;s grabbed me in a way that <a href="https://idlermag.com/tag/earthbound/">EarthBound</a> never did. I&#8217;m not deep enough into the story to say much in narrative terms about why that might be &#8212; and I&#8217;ll admit that I do want to go back to <em>EarthBound</em> on my own another day to try and figure out why so many classic RPG fans love it so much &#8212; so my initial take is that <em>Cave Story</em> does a really great job of mixing the architecture of the 2D platform game with the narrative techniques of the classic 2D RPG. (That is, it&#8217;s another example that <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/06/01/sucked-in/">game architecture isn&#8217;t determinative of genre</a>.) The game uses platform mechanics to allow the player to navigate the world, but RPG mechanics to deliver the story. The player jumps from ledge to ledge to get around town, and explore new areas, and has conversations with non-player characters (NPCs) to find out what to do next.</p>
<p>And for me, right now, that mixture is magic. The platformer elements add a bit of challenge and interest as I&#8217;m exploring, and the RPG story elements give me a reason to keep exploring, and to keep jumping in the difficult parts. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/11/18/mario-gets-old/">written</a> <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/10/playing-the-penguin/">before</a> that I&#8217;m not a big fan of platformers, but I&#8217;m enjoying <em>Cave Story</em>, and looking forward to playing more.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more I&#8217;m looking forward to talking about, hell, we could probably do an entire post just listing the cultural and video game references &#8212; Balrog alone cites both <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wG">Kool-Aid Man</a>, and there&#8217;s something very <em>Metroid</em> about the way the game makes you navigate vertically and horizontally, and retrace your steps rather than moving in a single direction <em>à la</em> Mario. Finally, I&#8217;m curious to know if anyone else noticed that when the Balrog asks if you want to fight, you can actually say &#8220;no&#8221; and he goes away. If the game is short enough, I my play though a second time just to find out if not fighting the Balrog has an impact later in the game. (I wanted the &#8220;experience&#8221; triangles, so I didn&#8217;t fight the Balrog in the demo, but I did fight him in my current playthrough of the full version. I also did some grinding in the graveyard, killing and respawning the knife-slasher frog until my pistol was at full power.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually a bit giddy, boys. It&#8217;s taking all my willpower to not start chanting <a href="http://mission17.org/documents/Derrida_LawOfGenre.pdf">&#8220;Genres are not to be mixed. I will not mix genres.&#8221;</a> (That&#8217;s right. I just threw down some Derrida. Bla-dow.)</p>
<p>Onward! Next time I talk about the actual story, rather than just acknowledge that it exists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 50 very pleasant hours playing BioWare&#8217;s <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, I&#8217;m at something of a loss to make sense of what just happened. Perhaps it&#8217;s useful to begin with my description of those 50 hours as &#8220;pleasant,&#8221; which isn&#8217;t quite correct. There was a tremendous &#8212; and very interesting &#8212; tension at work during my gameplay. I was often in something of a hurry, as the are very specific constraints on my play time, and portions of the <em>Mass Effect 2</em> experience are supremely slow. I found myself cringing every time I needed to move beyond my immediate surroundings by taking a shuttle to a new landing site or docking at a city. Even taking the elevator between levels on Commander Shepard&#8217;s ship the Normandy meant an interminable wait staring at a loading screen. The <em>Mass Effect</em> universe is a place constantly tottering on the brink of total collapse, with each of the various societies Shepard encounters pleading for intervention in the final minutes of their darkest hour, but there&#8217;s no particular urgency. If Shepard receives a report of a ship in danger of falling into a planet&#8217;s atmosphere, the player can rely on the event to not actually occur until Shepard has leisure enough to make the trip.</p>
<p>In fact, the unintended implication of <em>Mass Effect</em>&#8216;s episodic but non-sequential narrative architecture may be that the truly moral choice would be for Shepard to fly from system to system but never actually land. Each of the distress calls would continue to beckon, preserved in a stasis where some existential danger has been comprehended, but eternally delayed. I like to imagine entire generations living their whole lives on that ship, passing the story of the hero who will come to save them to their children and their children&#8217;s children. It&#8217;s an appealing counternarrative to the adolescent fantasy of an individual hero whose labors succeed where armies, scientists, and politicians have failed. It would also save the player from having to wait for all of those loading screens.</p>
<p>Even so, while it may not be quite right to speak of my time playing the game as pleasant, I have to acknowledge that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> was a rich experience. Peter Brooks<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> argues that a great deal of the pleasure of narrative comes not just from knowing the ending, but in the postponement of the ending, and in that light, <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a masterpiece. The plot of <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is actually pretty thin &#8212; Shepard dies (why not?), is brought back to figure out who is kidnapping entire human colonies, a crew is recruited, some navigational information is recovered, and everyone flies to the center of the galaxy to save the world and learn a little something about themselves.</p>
<p>But while the main story itself doesn&#8217;t give the player that much to do, there are a million ways to put off doing that handful of things. Every character Shepard recruits wants something, and expects Shepard to get, save, and/or destroy it for them. While I think BioWare would argue that these errands constitute a major part of the main storyline &#8212; and they did indeed compose a significant fraction of my play time &#8212; they&#8217;re also entirely optional. More importantly, in terms of the narrative architecture, making the character loyalty missions optional means that they have to be entirely independent of each other. Nothing that you do on any one loyalty mission can directly affect any other because the game can&#8217;t assume that you&#8217;ve completed (or will ever complete) any specific mission before completing another. Without that necessary sequential relation, there is no room for causes and effects. Each mission is its own context, meaning, and self-contained consequence, and Shepard remains a blank state onto which entire civilizations can project their hopes and fears, a knight-errant.</p>
<p>While BioWare is famous for their choice-centered <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/04/22/mass-effect/">good or evil/light side vs. dark side/paragon vs. renegade</a> gameplay, and for creating game franchises where the choices made in earlier games carry over into sequels, these choices can necessarily have only marginal impacts. If the player makes a choice that results in a character&#8217;s death in an earlier game, then this character will not show up in the sequel, but since each game must be created to encompass both the possibility that character X is alive and dead, then characters from earlier games <em>must</em> be limited to secondary (or cameo) roles in later games. Commercial constraints mean that BioWare cannot create a <em>Mass Effect 3</em> which cannot be beaten (or is ultimately any less rich of an experience) if any single character is killed in <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. (Imagine, for example, a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> where it doesn&#8217;t really matter whether Boromir or Aragorn dies. Tolkien would not have been able to make Aragorn so central to the plot of the second book, and so absolutely critical to the resolution of the war. Boromir&#8217;s death would be robbed of its classically tragic nobility.)</p>
<p>The result is that each game demands that you assemble a new cast of characters, and largely abandon your previous crew. Relationships still exist, sort of, but of necessity cannot be central to the action or narrative development of the new game. There are major choices in <em>Mass Effect 2</em> that promise to impact <em>Mass Effect 3</em> &#8212; you can strengthen or decimate the Geth, you can deliver the Collector base to Cerberus or destroy it &#8212; but these decisions cannot do much more than change a handful of cutscenes. (The outcome of the war does not really depend on whether you win the loyalty of Rohan or tell them off.)</p>
<p>None of which is to say that you shouldn&#8217;t play <em>Mass Effect 2</em>. It&#8217;s an extraordinary game in terms of visuals, setting, and characterization, but it&#8217;s a triumph of storytelling and not of story, of world building and not of narrative. Raph Koster has argued that <a href="http://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/20/narrative-is-not-a-game-mechanic/" target="_blank">&#8220;Narrative is not a game mechanic&#8221;</a> &#8212; that is that narrative in video games is not a central operation of the game itself but a way for the game to provide feedback to a player who is navigating the game&#8217;s essentially non-narrative problem set (mash button, kill monster, steer car, etc.). I&#8217;m not totally convinced by Koster&#8217;s argument, but <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a pretty strong example of what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is a picaresque (and a good one) and not a novel. It&#8217;s a convincing illusion of a world in which the player has agency and choices have persistent effects, even though the overarching story does its best to undo those effects. None of these observations are meant to be criticisms of the quality of the game. In fact, most of them could be addressed if BioWare were designing individual, standalone games rather than franchises. It&#8217;s not the mechanic/narrative interface that defeats the possibility of player choices from having a significant and lasting impact on the narrative world, it&#8217;s the lack of a clear and specific endpoint.</p>
<p>The world doesn&#8217;t end, and because the world continues, the game has to account for all the choices the player <em>didn&#8217;t</em> make.</p>
<p>So do enjoy <em>Mass Effect 2</em> &#8212; I did &#8212; but don&#8217;t feel bad if you take your time about it. The world will wait for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly fifty years and eleven actors, we have some idea of what makes the Doctor: <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">&#8220;He’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s a bit distant, and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">&#8220;he has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s dangerous &#8212; when the Doctor is around, people die &#8212; but he&#8217;s irresistible, and, in the David Tennant incarnation at least, he&#8217;s a walking broken heart. He&#8217;s the one who has to make all the impossible choices and save the world, even though he may not be able to save you.</p>
<p>After Christopher Eccleston spent a year breathing new life into the Doctor Who francise, and sacrificed himself to save pop singer Billie Piper (a.k.a. Rose Tyler) from a case of terminal omnipotence, David Tennant stepped into the Doctor&#8217;s trainers and travelling coat for a four-year, three-season run as the Tenth and best Doctor. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s run actually starts off a bit slowly, not entirely hitting its stride until halfway through #10&#8217;s second year (and second companion).</p>
<p>In &#8220;Human Nature/The Family of Blood,&#8221; the Doctor and companion Martha Jones hide out in early twentieth century England from a family of intergalactic hunters. In order to keep the family from tracking them, the Doctor has to alter his physiology to become human, and hide his memories and identity in a pocket watch. (It&#8217;s <em>Doctor Who</em>. Believe it or not, it all makes sense in the episode. Mostly.) The family is relentless, but they&#8217;re short-lived, so if the Doctor and Martha can hide for a few months, they&#8217;ll be safe.</p>
<p>While they&#8217;re hiding, however, the Doctor has no idea that he&#8217;s been anything other than John Smith, schoolteacher at a boys&#8217; boarding school. To make things worse, he&#8217;s fallen in love with the school nurse, Joan Redfern. In order to become the Doctor again, John Smith has to give up his existence. In effect, he has to die for the Doctor to live, and since the Family of Blood has found him, the Doctor has to live in order to be able to save the people John Smith loves.</p>

<p>It is, interestingly, a story in which the Doctor is almost entirely absent, even when David Tennant is onscreen, and when the Doctor returns, his return is terrible.</p>

<p>After this episode, David Tennant&#8217;s Doctor is constantly on the edge of not being the Doctor anymore. After defeating fellow Time Lord The Master (the brilliant, manic John Simm) in &#8220;The Last of the Time Lords,&#8221; the Doctor nearly gives up his itinerant existence in order to care for (and imprison) the one being who could actually be a full and equal companion. In &#8220;The Waters of Mars,&#8221; the Doctor abandons Time Lord constraints and attempts to intervene in a fixed point in history &#8212; avert a tragedy without which the human race might never have set out to explore the universe. In &#8220;Journey&#8217;s End,&#8221; the Doctor prevents a full regeneration (and the same sort of identity death that John Smith faced) by shunting his regeneration energy into the creation of a full second self, who isn&#8217;t a Time Lord, isn&#8217;t immortal, and, not coincidentally, end up getting to lead exactly the sort of life the Doctor wishes that he could have, sharing a single lifetime with an equal partner, instead of an eternal series of temporary companions.</p>
<p>Whatever he does, the Tenth Doctor is never able to escape the costs of his actions, and indeed, his very existence. He is always apologizing to the people he cannot save, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQkFNVhppXo" target="_blank">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In some sense, judging whether the Tenth Doctor is the best Doctor isn&#8217;t an entirely fair competition, since, rather unusually for a new Doctor, Tennant inherits a lot of the strongest elements of Eccleston&#8217;s (and Russell T. Davies&#8217;) modern <em>Doctor Who</em> relaunch. <em>Doctor Who</em> isn&#8217;t really known for continuity &#8212; in fact, each regeneration is normally treated as an entirely fresh start &#8212; but the Tenth Doctor benefits from the show&#8217;s willingness to reach back to previous companions and previous Doctors, and to continue to build on the relationships the Tenth Doctor creates. Companions depart and return &#8212; Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, and even Sarah Jane Smith, who traveled with the Third and Fourth Doctors. Every departure is heartbreaking. Every return comes at a cost, and leads both to triumph and further heartbreak.</p>
<p>For all that, in all honesty, I&#8217;m a bit surprised to not find myself fonder of Matt Smith&#8217;s Eleventh Doctor. The current head writer, Steven Moffat is responsible for many of the very best episodes of both the Ninth and Tenth Doctors&#8217; runs, including &#8220;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances,&#8221; the Christopher Eccleston episodes that finally made me a full-on rabid fan of the Doctor, and my absolute favorite episode, &#8220;Blink,&#8221; which really should totally devastate my argument since David Tennant is barely in it.</p>
<p>But the Eleventh Doctor&#8217;s episodes are somehow shallower. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s playfulness with language (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GMkWfpj4s" target="_blank">&#8220;Allons-y! I should say allons-y more often. Allons-y. Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!&#8221;</a>) is transformed into a penchant for silly hats. (I&#8217;ll give you the fez, Matt Smith, but the stetson/bow tie combination is not cool.) Even worse, Moffat somehow steps on his own best ideas. The Weeping Angels, so frightening and unique in &#8220;Blink,&#8221; (&#8220;The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death.&#8221;) are transformed into brutes that just snap your neck.</p>
<p>I will look forward to the new season, especially if it gives Matt Smith a chance to figure out who his Doctor is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/21/showbiz/tv/doctor-who-new-companion-ew/index.html" target="_blank">without Amy Pond</a>. No Doctor who hasn&#8217;t lost a companion is <em>really</em> the Doctor, and that, ultimately, is why the Tenth Doctor has to stand above Nine and Eleven.</p>
