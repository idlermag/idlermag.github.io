										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I first stood in front of the Raging Thrak Inn when I was twelve. The game was still called <em>Gemstone III</em>, and no one in the house was allowed to use the phone when I played, lest I get “booted.” I was a different character then. I quit playing when I was fourteen, then joined again in my mid-twenties. Things change in a decade. The inn hasn’t changed much, which is a comfort.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon <em>Gemstone III</em> while exploring AOL’s games section. That was back in the days when AOL presented their online content in curated sections, only one of which was labeled the “world wide web.” Take a drive on that information superhighway, and it was nothing but GeoCities and Angelfire pages for miles. At least it seemed that way. I didn’t much care for it. </p>
<p>Games I could always get behind, though, and soon enough I found myself in <em>Gemstone</em>’s character creator. After getting over the initial shock of seeing nothing but scrolling text on my screen (this was a video game?), I chose my race, profession, physical characteristics, and name. I also placed a limited number of training points into various stats and skills without having any idea of what I was doing. Soon enough, I was thrust into the high fantasy world of Elanthia, dressed in rags and standing in an alley in a frontier town called Wehnimer’s Landing. </p>
<p>Eventually I made my way to the town square, which was buzzing with activity. There were other people here, real people, and they were healing each other, raising the dead, pickpocketing, talking, laughing, passing through. The text scrolling by so quickly was dizzying.</p>

<p>Town Square Central remains a hub of activity today. There’s no better place to drag a dead body, I can tell you that much. It’s still the best place to find both a healer and a cleric on short notice.</p>
<p>Here in <em>Gemstone IV</em>, I step into the Raging Thrak Inn’s barroom, then move west to the trophy room. With some trepidation, I move behind a non-descript thrak hide curtain.</p>
<p>Thank the Arkati he’s still here.</p>
<p>A thrak is a monster in the game, but the Raging Thrak is a human warrior gone to seed, and if a young player seeks him out, both experience and wisdom can be gained from the meeting.</p>
<p>He surprises me by launching into his spiel:</p>
<p>“Well, now,” he starts off, “it seems we have another fresh young face right off the turnip farms come to town to be a hero. Bein&#8217; a hero ain&#8217;t all it&#8217;s cracked up to be some days, but most of the time it&#8217;s pretty excitin&#8217;. Now, listen up and I&#8217;ll give ya the benefit of my many years of wisdom, gleaned from the farthest corners of the lands and the brightest and best of the heroes of the past.”</p>
<p>I’m level 17, three trains away from titling. I’m a long way from the turnip farms, Mr. Thrak, sir. Nonetheless, I sit and listen to his advice, for nostalgia’s sake. Except I’m fairly sure you can’t have this meeting more than once. It’s a tutorial for new players. Thrak gives several paragraphs of information on game mechanics and etiquette, and quizzes you afterwards. You gain a modest amount of experience points if answer the questions correctly. Could it be I never visited the Thrak with my current character?</p>
<p>Sure enough, here’s the test. I pass with flying colors.</p>

<p>Ha! Level 18! So I suppose I didn’t come to see him this time. I laugh, in real life and in the game, like this:</p>
<p>&gt;laugh<br />
You laugh out loud!<br />
&gt;</p>
<p>I get a little misty in real life. I play it cool in the game. </p>
<p>It’s strange, the things that cause you to look back. Listening to the old warrior tell me to avoid using all caps or multiple exclamation marks when speaking to other players sends me shooting back through time to the age of wearing cutoffs, and climbing trees, and otter pops, and riding bikes. An age of cops and robbers, and my neighbor’s swing set, and my other neighbor’s friendly mutt dog. </p>
<p>An age where this:</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>Meant “What’s next?”</p>
<p>The age of my first MUD. My first RPG, for that matter. My first, but certainly not last, text-based game. Perhaps my first experience feeling emotion while playing a video game. Perhaps <em>Gemstone</em> is a reason I write about video games. Strike that “perhaps.” It’s most definitely a reason. It taught me how to type, at the very least.  </p>
<p>To say writing about video games here at <em>The Idler</em> was an honor and a pleasure would be an understatement. It’s only been a couple of months, but the brightest flames burn quickest, they say. Even more of a pleasure was reading the works of my fellow Idlers. I still have much of the archives to comb through. I can’t wait to look back.</p>
<p>But let’s all remember to look forward, too. Here, a parting gift:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I understand why you cheated. But I still love you, Shepard. I want to understand what this is between us, and make it real. That’s what I want. What do you want?”</p>
<p>I pause before answering. Not because I’m torn for choice, but because I don’t know quite what to say. I do know what I’d like to say:</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, ‘cheated?’ You understand why I ‘cheated?’ I don’t think so, Major. </p>
<p>“So I spent some time flirting with you while we served on the Normandy. That is, if listening to you recount how you white-knighted some girl in biotic school by killing your teacher is considered flirting.  Don’t get me wrong, it sounds like the bastard pretty much deserved it, but whoa. I mean, I watched the slaughtering of my entire family on Mindoir, then watched my entire Alliance unit get devoured by a thresher maw on Akuze, but I never accidentally broke a dude’s neck over a boy I liked. That’s some hardcore darkness you’ve got swirling around inside you, buddy!</p>
<p>“Yes, there was also the night before Ilos, and I’m not going to take anything away from that. Our ragged band of brothers was heading into an uncertain future, and you and I managed a sweet, if brief, moment of connection before it all went down. As if enough hadn’t already gone down. Between almost having to shoot Wrex and losing Ash on Virmire, I was barely holding on. You were there for me, and I was there for you. We’ll always have Ilos.</p>

<p>“Then I defeated Saren and saved the Citadel. Do you remember what happened after that? A Collector ship attacked the Normandy, ripped a hole in its side, and I got spaced. And DIED. I died, Kaidan. Dead. Suffocated in space, where no one could hear me scream. Not that I could, due to that whole suffocating thing. But thanks to Cerberus (I know, I know, you’re not a huge fan), I was rebuilt as a regular Bionic Woman and woke back up &#8212; two years later.</p>
<p>“And I’ll never forget our reunion on Horizon. Your dramatic entrance from behind those crates, touting me as the savior of the Citadel and a living legend. The awkward hug. Your accusations that I was showing up after two years and acting like nothing happened. Your petulant whining that you thought we had something, something real. </p>
<p>“‘Thinking you were dead tore me apart,’ you said. ‘How could you put me through that?’</p>
<p>“Uh, I was dead, then unconscious for two years? Then I woke up to some serious shit going down, what with those Collectors abducting people from colonies all over the galaxy? Like they did right before you got all up in my face, on the very ground we were standing upon? Believe it or not, things aren’t always about you? </p>
<p>“So all this talk of cheating and the ‘I still love you,’ stuff? We spent one night together, sweetie. Then you (rightfully) assumed I was dead. Then, and I can’t stress this enough, two years went by. I hate to be all Ross about this, but I think we were on a break, at the very least. A reasonable person would assume all bets were off. But like I said, I never accidentally broke a dude’s neck over a boy I liked.</p>
<p>“What do I want? I want you to shoot what I tell you to shoot, or lift the baddies up into the air so I can shoot them. I want you to quit being such a dummy. I want you to stop acting like a sixth grader facing rejection for the first time. I want you to get it together, Alenko.”</p>
<p>I don’t say this. I don’t say any of it. I opt for the kinder, simpler, “I’m sorry Kaidan, but we should just keep it professional.”</p>
<p>Then you make me pay for the lunch you invited me to.</p>
<p>You know what? Garrus is way better in the sack anyway.</p>

<p>My cousin was the only one in the family with a Super Nintendo growing up. I skipped that particular Nintendo console since I was embroiled in an ill-fated affair with the Sega CD, so I was always interested in playing it whenever I went to my aunt’s house. The only games my cousin had were <i>Madden</i> and <i>NHL ’96</i>. I had no idea what I was doing, and my cousin was having too much fun pummeling the noob to stop and give me tips. Thus began my hatred of sports games. I haven’t touched one since.</p>
<p>In the interest of bettering myself, I decided to seek out a sports gamer and get his or her perspective on the genre. Maybe then I could begin strengthening my gaming weakness. Fortunately, my friend Brandon Kelley was just the guy I was looking for, and sat down with me to discuss his gaming history and the finer points of the <i>FIFA</i> franchise.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Do you need me to spell my name for the record?</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> You’re not on trial here, sir.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> We’ll see!</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So, something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is how I have certain holes in my gaming experience, and as a games writer I feel like I shouldn’t have any. But I just can’t get into sports games! You’re the only person I know who plays sports games regularly.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Right, right, and with the first-person shooters you at least try to play them but you’re just not any good.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Well, I’m getting better because of <i>Mass Effect</i>, which is third-person, but I’ve found I’ve been able to translate skills. I’ll never be good enough for multiplayer, but then a lot of people aren’t. But first let me ask you a couple questions about your gaming experience in general: how long have you been playing video games?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I vaguely remember when I was a small boy, for Christmas, my family got the Atari &#8212; I can’t remember if it was the 2600 or the 5200 &#8212; it was whichever one they stopped making games for maybe two years after it came out. And my dad was really into it and he would play it with my brother and me. My brother’s three years older than me. We’d play <i>Breakout</i>, which you know is very similar to that game everybody plays on their Blackberry. And we also played this game called <i>Bounty Bob</i> or <i>Miner 2049er</i>, and it was kind of a rip off of <i>King Kong</i> where you played this little miner who had a mustache. Or at least it looked like he had a mustache.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Wait, <i>King Kong</i> or <i>Donkey Kong</i>?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Uh, <i>Donkey Kong</i>.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I’m a real gamer.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> (laughs) Hey, there could be a game that’s licensed to <i>King Kong</i> that I don’t know about.</p>

<p><b>BK:</b> Uh, no, definitely not. But the object of the game with <i>Bounty Bob</i> was that there was a course with various platforms and ladders like <i>Donkey Kong</i>, and as your guy walked over the platform it filled in with color. You just basically had to traverse all of the platforms, and then you’d move on to the next level.</p>
<p>So, post-Atari we got our first personal computer as a family. I was about ten so this would have been the late eighties, and there was a game that sort of lit me up called <i>Freddy’s Rescue Roundup</i>. Did you ever play this game?</p>
<p><strong>SC:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>BK:</strong> It was similar to <i>Bounty Bob</i> where you were this little guy Freddy and you’d just make him jump with the spacebar, and you’d have to collect all these pigeons throughout the course. I remember always stealing away to the basement where the computer was to play <i>Freddy’s Rescue Roundup </i>and listen to the radio for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Then there was the Super Nintendo, and that was when I would say you could really call me a “gamer.” The Super Nintendo was bought for both my brother and me for Christmas, but he never played it. I played it all the time. <i>Street Fighter II</i>, <i>Super Mario World</i>, with the cape. I remember the day I got 100% completion on <i>Super Mario World</i>. That was huge.</p>
<p>Leading into sports games, I can remember having two sports games that I played on the SNES: <i>NBA Jam</i> &#8212; “He’s heating up! He’s on fire!” &#8212; and then there was a game called <i>Super Soccer Champ</i>. <i>Super Soccer Champ</i> was a sports arcade game, as opposed to a sports simulator, which is a distinction that will be important when we’re talking about <i>FIFA</i>. But I’d play that game with my buddy Kevin cooperatively, as opposed to facing off, which was pretty novel at the time.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Did you play sports in real life at all?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yeah. I played soccer when a little kid in the local township leagues, and I continued to play through high school. I was a letterman.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Nice. So you were good at soccer in real life, then.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Well, I was good enough to play in high school. (laughs) I was passionate about soccer, but I wasn’t good enough to explore that passion through my own athleticism. What’s exciting about getting into the simulation aspect of <i>FIFA</i> is that games like that allow you as a fan and former player to exercise your brain &#8212; your tactical sports brain &#8212; and see the fruits of that tactical awareness on the screen, when you physically can’t achieve that.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Would you say that the primary reason you play video games in general is to achieve that kind of immersion?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I don’t know. I think with my most memorable gaming experiences, that would not be true. Through high school, the game I played most was a puzzle game called <i>Bust-A-Move 2 </i>for the PlayStation. My favorite thing to do would be to come home from school, fire up the PlayStation and <i>Bust-A-Move</i>, and put on my favorite music CD at the time. I guess it was immersion in that I got to let everything else go away, and I wouldn’t have to think of anything but that activity. I would of course do that thing that you do when playing any game &#8212; be it jump rope, hopscotch, or shooting basketballs &#8212; I would think, if I don’t get the high score on this level then I’m going to hell.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Then the floor is lava.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11172" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/10/the-sport-of-youth-and-fashion-of-the-age/pic2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg" data-orig-size="640,392" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pic2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=392" alt="This floor is lava" width="640" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11172" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Then the floor is lava. Or you imagine that you’re competing for a gold medal in the Olympic event that is <i>Bust-A-Move 2</i>. So I think that maybe that’s me trying to insert myself into the game. But in <i>FIFA</i> you’re able to…</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> And <i>FIFA</i> is currently your game of choice, right?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yeah, <i>FIFA</i> is my game of choice. I play the online pro portion of the game where you take a player from a very amateur skill level and compete online with other real-life players, or with your team with other real-life players, in order to improve your guy. As he scores goals, completes passes, runs a certain distance, he becomes a better player.</p>
<p>You can mold this player to physically look the way you want. His height, his weight, his face, his hair, and a lot guys try to make theirs look really cool like <i>World of Warcraft</i> style. But I always try to make my guy look exactly like me so when I’m playing I can imagine it’s me up there.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So then <i>FIFA</i> is totally about immersing yourself in the game you love.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Totally.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So you play online with real people. Tell me a little bit about your. . . club?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yes, it’s “club.” Right now there are about fifteen players on the team, and of those fifteen probably five would be considered inactive because they never play with us. Of the remaining ten people it’s a constant rotation of four or five that are online at any given time. We usually only play together as a club if we have at least three people online. You play with less than three, and you’re putting yourselves at a disadvantage.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Because AI populates the rest of your team?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Exactly. You have much less control.</p>
<p>So our club, Half Baked FC, called such because the creators of the club are really big into the movie <i>Half Baked</i> starring Dave Chappelle and Jim Breuer, we play in a stadium that is called Mile High Stadium. When I first started playing, our team “kit,” or uniform, was the LA Galaxy uniform because their sponsor is Herbalife. Now I don’t think this is particularly interesting, but if you’re an online gamer you run into a lot of stoners.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Hm. I see.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Most of the guys on my team are stoners. They’ll have to take thirty second breaks to “roll a doobie.” Their words, not mine.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> You seem as though you are, perhaps, not a stoner?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I am not, and I’ll have interesting conversations with the guys on the team where they say, “so uh, you don’t smoke weed, do you?”</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Wow, they can tell just from your voice?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> (laughs) Well no, they ask directly. But their follow up question is always, “so, what DO you do?” Look, I’m the oldest person on this club, so far as I know.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11174" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/10/the-sport-of-youth-and-fashion-of-the-age/pic3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,392" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1353584578&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pic3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=392" alt="GOOOOOOAAAL!!!" width="640" height="392" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11174" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/pic3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Do you have any long-standing rivals? Every team needs a long-standing rival.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> That’s true, but there are just too many teams. There are teams that we come up against frequently, but you know this from playing online, most rivalries stem from various racial epithets being thrown around the headset.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Or in my case, some classic sexual harassment.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Right, and I don’t condone any of it at all! Though I’m not above trash talking.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> There’s a difference between trash talking and harassment, though. What would be a choice trash talk from Brandon Kelley?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I like a good “yeah, bitch.” (laughs) It depends on the situation. If I’m trash talking in the instance where I got the better of the other team, then I’ll deploy the “yeah, bitch.” If I have to get involved in trash talking when I have been on the losing end, I’ll only do it if they did, in fact, best me. There will be situations where the other team won either through computer error, or they just got lucky. Then I will have to tell them.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> (laughs) You will have to inform them of this.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> “I’m sorry, but there was a CPU error. The artificial intelligence really needs to be improved in this aspect of the game, since it was the only reason why you were able to score a goal.”</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> And you do it in this calm, reasonable manner, I’m assuming. That’s really helpful of you.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> My actual favorite trash talk right now is when I do something that’s really great, I’ll do the McDonald’s theme song: (sings) “Boo do boo boo boo, I’m lovin’ it!” I especially like that one because my Polish teammate is also really into it, so he’ll do it too. Then of course there’s the old standby: “You mad?” The one I’ve been trying to work in that I don’t think is going to work is, “Google me.”</p>
<p>What’s interesting about my team, is that we have been playing together for about two years, but I don’t know anybody’s real name. So, Hairy_Bud: everyone calls him “Hairy.” Maybe his real name is Harold, I don’t know. There’s a Marine, and his PlayStation screen name is USMC and then some four-digit number that has some significance to him. So we call him “US.” I think his name is Ryan? They call me Kelley, because I chose my screen name without fully understanding the world I was getting into and used my gmail address. (Sara laughs) Yeah, I’m pretty close to just having my social security number be my handle. But then somebody calls me “NYC” because they know I live in New York City.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like being in the military, where everyone goes by a nickname like “Tex.” And I absolutely feel camaraderie with these guys. Particularly when new people come into the team. They are expected to defer to the founding members of the club and to those who have been around for longer. It’s very comfortable when I log on with these guys. There’s no awkward interaction. There’s a rapport that’s already been established.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> So it’s like playing on a real-life sports team.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Yeah. These are guys who you would be comfortable enough around to say, “Man, I had a shitty day.” And you can sort of let off some of that tension.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> That’s awesome. So what was the last non-sports game you played that you really enjoyed? Just to prove you have breadth in your experience.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I really enjoyed <i>Journey</i>.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Perfect game. I hesitate to call any game perfect, but perfect game. That and <i>Portal</i>.</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> I definitely wouldn’t dispute that.</p>
<p><b>SC:</b> Thanks for chatting with me. Maybe sports games don’t actually “suck hard” as twelve-year-old me would say while suffering through <i>Madden</i>. Any parting words?</p>
<p><b>BK:</b> Google me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always been a great player of pretend. I love telling stories. As I child, I was often accused of having an overactive imagination. When I’d play outside with the neighborhood kids, I’d go beyond the typical “cops and robbers” and do “mob boss versus grizzled detective who’s getting too old for this stuff,” and add a subplot about a wandering preacher whose charisma dupes them both.</p>
<p>I’d perform soliloquies for Stitch, my teddy bear. My G.I. Joes took part in an ever-evolving saga of espionage. My Barbie dolls were the members of a huge and convoluted family tree, and participated in all the drama that comes with it. My mom’s Barbie was the mom. She still wore her makeup and hair exactly the way she did when she was a teenager herself. </p>
<p>Can’t you see it just dates you, Babs? You don’t look any younger!</p>
<p>I was also a voracious reader and movie watcher. I especially dug sci-fi. I saw <em>Alien</em> for the first time when I was eight, and apart from gifting me with the image that still pops up in my nightmares (the baby xenomorph birthing itself from John Hurt’s chest, obviously), it also introduced me to Our Ripley of Nostromo, the first female film character I found entirely relatable. I mean, Leia was close, but at the end of the day? I wanted to be Han Solo. Soon enough, I was calling my cat “Jonesy” and pretending she and I were going into cryostasis when we’d go to bed.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11123" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/04/12/a-shepard-prepares/jonesyalien/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg" data-orig-size="640,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="JonesyAlien" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360" alt="Jonesy" width="640" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11123" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>She always wanted to sleep directly on my head though, the little facehugger.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be great, I thought, to up the ante? To actually feel like I was on a spaceship? To wear the right clothes, say the right words, and be surrounded by a bunch of people doing the same? To feel really immersed in these worlds? Heck yes, it would. So I decided to become an actor.</p>
<p>And I did, and it was great. I made people laugh and cry (mostly laugh). I met the people who make up my core group of friends. I met my husband. I made contacts that got me my first paying gigs in New York. I told a lot of stories.</p>
<p>However, as with most things that are awesome, there was a catch. While little Sara assumed it was the actors who were at the center of the make-believe, actor Sara discovered it was really the audience (as of course it should be). </p>
<p>It may look like she’s on the deck of spaceship, but she’s actually standing in front of several panels of green spandex. Her costume is held together in the back by safety pins. Half the time, she’s not even talking with the person who appears in the scene with her. Theatre offers her more immersion, but then it’s a constant exchange of energy with the audience, because they’re actually there in the room. That energy exchange is important and wonderful and absolutely thrilling, and I miss it dearly, but there came a time when I realized I was the one who wanted to be fooled.</p>
<p>Enter Commander Shepard, stage right. </p>
<p>I was already well acquainted with the immersive qualities of video games, but <em>Mass Effect</em> took dead aim at my childhood fantasies and struck true. An epic space fantasy spanning three games, where decisions from the first affect outcomes in the second and third, it offered me the chance to be the badass space explorer I always wanted to be. </p>

<p>I stalked the decks of the Normandy. I donned space armors and wielded high tech weapons. I befriended my crew. Flirted with them, too. Some of them died, and I mourned them. I helped some people, and hurt some others. I saved the galaxy. For the most part, I was the good gal, but I followed my own code &#8212; sometimes you just have to use the Renegade interrupt option and blow up that gas tank your opponent is too busy monologuing to notice.</p>
<p>“Boring conversation anyway,” you’ll say out loud from your couch. </p>
<p>A video game tells a story for an audience of one. A great video game lets that audience help tell it. I may never get a chance to play Ripley in the <em>Alien</em> reboot (though I am totally available, Hollywood), but my Shepard ain’t a half bad substitute. Especially because she’s mine.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to tell stories, and I’ve got no plans to stop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>April 9, 2009</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsettled. I’ve never traveled for work before, but I like that it’s a thing &#8212; “traveling for work.”</p>
<p>“Do you get to do any traveling?” people ask when you tell them you’re considering a job. </p>
<p>“Two or three times a year,” in this case.</p>
<p>“That’s great!” they respond, as if it’s somehow a <em>de facto</em> vacation. </p>
<p>I suppose it is in some ways, but mostly I feel the weighty responsibility to be the sole representative for my company while speaking with customers, and to avoid overspending my per diem. I also feel like it’s my job not to get swallowed up by this city with which I am absolutely unfamiliar. </p>
<p>Well, that’s not entirely true. </p>
<p>I am familiar with Washington, D.C., but not from any practical experience. I just lived here (virtually) for about two hundred hours in <em>Fallout 3</em>.</p>
<p>Of one thing I’m certain: I was completely unprepared to ride the escalator out of the metro station this morning. As I made the long and steep ascent, that distinctive concrete ceiling curving all the way around me, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. I used to think that was just an expression, but I actually reached back there and felt the little downy buggers standing at attention. Then Ron Perlman’s voice intoned somewhere inside the back of my head: “War. War never changes.”</p>
<p>So, UNSETTLED. I am it.</p>

<p><strong>April 10, 2009</strong></p>
<p>The conference I’m attending hasn’t been too busy, which is fine by me, since I’m pretty much flying by the seat of my pants over here. Fortunately I speak fluent Shakespeare Geek, so even if I can’t answer an academic’s question about the varying introductions to different editions, I can at least end the conversation with a genial quote-off.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to venture too far out for lunch, since I’m the only one working the booth. D.C. favorite Five Guys Burgers and Fries is near the conference hotel. The Washington Post says they’re the “Willie Wonkas of burgercraft,” so I thought I’d give it a shot.</p>
<p>Side note: who spells “Willy Wonka” incorrectly? Where was your childhood, o nameless journalist? Know you not Roald Dahl? Gene Wilder? Have you eaten nary a Nerd?!</p>
<p>On the way to lunch today I saw a dog tied up outside a Chinatown gift shop. I’m not sure what breed it was. Some kind of smallish terrier, I think. No blue heeler, to be sure, but I couldn’t help thinking of my beloved Dogmeat from <em>Fallout 3</em>. It was definitely friendly, so I gave it a pat on the head and almost involuntarily said, “You know, I think you&#8217;re the first dog I&#8217;ve met that didn&#8217;t try to eat me.”</p>
<p>Once again I got the neck hair prickles. Once again I ruminated over the popular idea that video games aren’t able to affect us as deeply as other art forms, and furthermore, won’t ever be able to do so. </p>
<p>I am unconvinced.</p>
<p>On the way back from the burger joint, the dog was still outside the shop, lounging in a patch of sidewalk sun. I still had half a brown sack of fries because seriously, they give you way too many. The dog lifted its head at my approach. Maybe it was because of the earlier head pat, but I had a feeling it had more to do with the aroma of the peanut oil fried potatoes in my possession. In a different (virtual) time and different (virtual) place, this might have been my chance to gain a permanent companion. So I slipped it a fry. </p>
<p>So sorry anonymous dog parent, but the cat will mew, and dog will have his day!</p>

<p><strong>April 11, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Today was the last day of the conference. Farewell, English professor who lurked around my booth the whole time! You had a face as gaunt as Charon’s with a personality to match. That is to say, I liked you.</p>
<p>I scheduled an evening train back to New York, but the conference exhibits closed at 12:30, so that means someone got the whole afternoon to herself. I knew exactly what to do. I popped in the earbuds to my iPod, queued up my Galaxy News Radio playlist, and headed out to the National Mall. Why fight it? I’m finding my way around D.C. via my intimate knowledge of a video game. True story.</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed to find traveling from The Capitol Building to the Lincoln Memorial took about a hundred years longer than it took me in-game. Not to mention I don’t have anywhere near the endurance of my avatar. Can you imagine what kind of great shape you’d be in, carrying 150+ pounds of wasteland crap around at any given time? I didn’t mind the long walk, though. Time flies when you’ve got The Ink Spots’ “Maybe” in your ear.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see the Museum of American History and Museum of Technology (er, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum) were exactly where I left them, and in better condition, to boot! </p>
<p>By the time I reached the Washington Monument and Danny Kaye was refusing to leave the Congo, a woman stopped me to ask for directions. Wearing iPod earbuds is apparently a sign for “I know where I’m going,” even in D.C. It means the same thing in New York, but there I like to pretend it really means “leave me the hell alone.” I was happy to oblige this woman’s request, though. It was a beautiful day in the Capital Wasteland.</p>
<p>“Do you know the way to the Lincoln Memorial?” she queried.</p>
<p>“It’s a straight shot thataway,” I pointed west. “But don’t go straight down the middle. I mean, unless you want the experience.”</p>
<p>She laughed because she thought I was making a joke about wading through the reflecting pool. I smiled because I knew it really was about leveling up. And super mutants.</p>
<p><em>That’s right, lady</em>, I thought, <em>I’m the Lone Wanderer, and this is real life.</em></p>
