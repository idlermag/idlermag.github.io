					<description><![CDATA[A little known fact about me is that when I listen to music (at home) I dance to it.  Nothing too extreme or dumb looking, but I do cut the rug and sometimes I miss those mornings of dancing around getting ready for work.
When I hear Jumping Jack Flash by the Stones it is VERY hard to not dance like Mick Jagger in the promo film. In fact I have a hard time not imitating Jagger in the Dancing In the Street video!
As I listen and relisten to this Fatboy Slim mix I dance to it, but not in a traditional way. I dance to it like I was a DJ. Pumping the air, dramatic finger movements, the whole act. I feel like I can FEEL the crowd that is bearing witness to the mix, the highs and the lows and the parts designed to bring oxygen back onto the dance floor before unleashing a cut to make 5500 people not touch the ground. 
I love that feeling.]]></description>
