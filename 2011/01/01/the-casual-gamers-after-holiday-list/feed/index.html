					<description><![CDATA[[...] Last year, the PS2 was my console recommendation, based on the assumption that &#8220;Casual Gamer&#8221; readers are either relative non-gamers, or already own whatever console(s) they really want. This year, coming to the end of the lifespan of the current generation of consoles, prices are down, game libraries are deep, and there&#8217;s really no reason not to pick up a Playstation 3 or an XBox 360. As a game system, Blu-ray player, and Netflix streaming hub, my own PS3 is the most important device hooked up to my TV. For the entry-level gamer, or the advanced gamer looking for something different, I&#8217;d recommend the Kinect. I&#8217;m still not totally sure that motion control will ever take over gaming, but it really doesn&#8217;t need to. Having had the chance to (finally) try the Wii, the Playstation Move, and the Kinect, I&#8217;m willing to say that if motion control has a future, it&#8217;s the Kinect. The Move is a genuine advancement over the Wii (to be fair, so is the Wii Motion Plus), but only the Kinect is able in a single device to let players use hands, feet, body, and head as inputs. I&#8217;m not one much for dance games, but I&#8217;d argue that only games using the Kinect are even worth the name. Microsoft is selling a bundle with a 4 GB hard drive for $299, but installing the Kinect takes up nearly that much space by itself, so spending the extra $100 for the 250 GB bundle is really worth it.
