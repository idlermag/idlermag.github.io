					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/01/06/navigating-the-third-dimension/#comment-773&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;.

John,

Indeed! My copy of the strategy guide finally arrived last week (after I wrote my post), and I realized that Cloud and Tifa are from elsewhere. As you note, I&#039;m likely to make some more fairly basic blunders as I go. I&#039;m about to raid Shinra headquarters, so I&#039;m still really early in the game.

Thanks for reading! I hope you&#039;ll stick with me and let me know when I&#039;m way off-base. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your last point about cloud growing up with tifa in the slums is an incorrect assumption. You&#039;ll find out though, there is a lot to look forward to if you&#039;re only at the train graveyards :)

Enjoy it!!

Wish I could play it for the first time again, my favourite ever game.]]></description>

Yeah, I somehow missed the &quot;select&quot; thing on my first attempt as well, but found out about it this time through. Haven&#039;t had to use it yet. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting that you mentioned the problems with doors your first play through. I had no problem with this, but some of my friends did back in the day. Thankfully, the select button should bring up arrows to show you where both you are and the doorways.]]></description>
