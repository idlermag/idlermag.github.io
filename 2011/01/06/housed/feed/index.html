Yeah, for better or worse, that&#039;s why I didn&#039;t rename. I love my wife (Hi, honey!), but naming Tifa after my wife doesn&#039;t exactly have the adolescent thrill of naming her after a crush, and having already to schedule my playing time, um, delicately, that&#039;s added stress I don&#039;t need.

I was also probably put off by my recent re-play of FFI, where I did name the white mage after my wife, but being limited to 4 characters meant that I played the game with a somewhat ambiguous &quot;Dani.&quot;]]></description>

All those names, actually, are an &lt;Em&gt;homage&lt;/em&gt; to earlier days since this whole experience is fundamentally nostalgic. Nobody but people from high school call me, &quot;Andy&quot; and &quot;Marian&quot; was an old college girlfriend (I have no current crushes, now that I think about it). &quot;Mr. T,&quot; of course, is just name that because it&#039;s the rule.]]></description>

So far no compatibility issues, but I have found that the music emulation doesn&#039;t rival the original. It&#039;s something about the midi conversion, I think.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Happily, I seem to have escaped being housed. :-)

I&#039;m taking from the screen shoots that you&#039;re playing on a PC. Any system compatibility issues with the game as time has passed? What sort of a controller do you use (or not)?]]></description>
