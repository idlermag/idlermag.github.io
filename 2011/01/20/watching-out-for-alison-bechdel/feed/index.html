					<description><![CDATA[I love the Bechdel test because it allows me to feel like a critical observer when really I am nothing of the sort. I would like a model for gay films that requires the story to be about something other than one out lesbian meeting someone not out/ not aware she&#039;s gay/married. And for the main drama to be about something other than admitting gayness to parents/self.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love Bechdel, and I love that your piece talks about both DTWOF and Fun Home. When Kevin and I were talking about film a while ago (he was pontificating, I was listening, as I know nothing about film), he mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel&#039;s_Law#Bechdel_test&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bechdel test&lt;/a&gt;, and I nudged him to figure out whether he&#039;d actually read any Bechdel. To my amazement, he was familiar with Dykes to Watch Out For, but had never heard of Fun Home, making him possibly the only straight person I&#039;ve ever encountered who knew Bechdel in such a fashion.

So, I guess the point is kudos all around. Especially to Bechdel. :-)]]></description>
