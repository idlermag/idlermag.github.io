					<description><![CDATA[Jill, if you try kale, I highly recommend making crispy kale. Just tear the kale into bite-size pieces, coat them in vegetable oil, put them on a cookie sheet, and sprinkle a little salt over. Bake at 375 for 8 minutes or until they start to dry out and get a bit crispy. Then eat! It&#039;s delicious. I promise.]]></description>

Kale&#039;s on my list too! I think all of the veggies in the collard greens-type genre are supposed to be wicked healthy. But let&#039;s be honest, cheap is my priority.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This looks awesome. I struggle with trying to get enough veggies in my diet. One veg I thought I would HATE but I have actually found to be quite edible is kale. I put it in lots of veg stews and such. I get the nice health bonus of eating something so high in vitamins. Also, it&#039;s cheap as hell.]]></description>
