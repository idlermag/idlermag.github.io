					<description><![CDATA[While I think I&#039;m in the minority that liked the epilogue (mostly because I worship at the church of Saint Rowling, and partly because sometimes I like things to just work out ok in the end), I agree with you about Harry--Auror doesn&#039;t make much sense. It gives such a lovely circular sense of satisfaction to see Neville end up at Hogwarts that seeing Harry there would make it that much better. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love it!  I haven&#039;t read the 7th book since it came out and I&#039;m failing at my project of rereading all the books before the very last movie is released.  Nice to have the recap and the insight!  Excellent!]]></description>
