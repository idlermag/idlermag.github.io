					<description><![CDATA[I know that I see colors a little bit different from other people due to my boyfriend telling me (along with a few other people) that my car is blue and I see periwinkle. I did not however, no that this exists. That is really cool to me actually, and it may explain why I have had students absolutely freak if I try to get them to write words in different colors. Thanks for sharing this tid bit of info Lindsey!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is interesting! I have definitely thought before about how there&#039;s no way to measure how same colors might be perceived differently to different people (since you can&#039;t borrow anyone else&#039;s eyes to fund out!), but hadn&#039;t read about the phenomenon of synesthesia. Cool article!]]></description>
