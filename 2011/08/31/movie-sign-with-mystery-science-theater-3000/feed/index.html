					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/08/31/movie-sign-with-mystery-science-theater-3000/#comment-1844&quot;&gt;Daniel J. Hogangan&lt;/a&gt;.

If MST3K were a food, I&#039;d be 700 pound happy man wearing assorted muumuu&#039;s and have to be fork lifted off the couch. 

My top 5 favorite episodes but I love every episodes like an estranged child.

1. Final Sacrifice - Rowsdooower! Never has Canada been so funny...well maybe except for curling. &quot;I wonder if there&#039;s beer on the sun!&quot; more denim in that movie than should be allowed by Canadian law.

2. Legend of Boggy Creek 2. Despite I&#039;ve been mispronouncing it &quot;Boogie Creek&quot; all these years I still find the redneck jokes hilarious. If you get the chance be sure to check out the original Boggy Creek as it&#039;s actually a pretty creepy pseudo-documentary. Boggy Creek 2 on the other hand is creepy mainly due to the tiny man shirts and a scrawny cracker boy who refuses to wear a shirt.

3. Hobgoblins - If Gremlins was made a coke smoking high school drop out. The rake fight scene is often compared to the climatic light saber dual in Phantom Menace only better!

4. Pod People - Alf terrorizes a small boy when his TV show is canceled killing dozens of teenagers and forest rangers. &quot;Trumpy, you can do stupid stuff!&quot; I still quote the heck out of this episode &quot;Huzzzaaaahhh!!&quot; usually when it&#039;s not appropriate to say &quot;Huzzaaaah!&quot;

5. Manos: The Hands of Fate - roughly translated in &quot;Hands: the hands of fate.&quot; The only episode I had to take a shower after watching, but still couldn&#039;t scrub the shame away. &quot;Time to hit the stain!&quot; Probably the best movie ever made by a Texas fertilizer salesman.

And in case ye&#039;all didn&#039;t know there&#039;s a 24hrs MST3K channel on justin.tv. So you too can now be as unproductive as me.]]></description>

&quot;Mike, can you hand me my plans? Thanks! Hmm. Breach Hull, all Die. Even had it underlined.&quot; - perhaps my favorite joke of MST3K the Movie.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve got the Wild Wild World of Batwoman on VHS!  My GOD it&#039;s a mess!  
I Accuse My Parents is also a FANTASTIC episode.
As for The Movie:  I spent the better part of an entire summer watching it repeatedly.  &quot;Then I ram my ovipositor down your throat, and lay my eggs in your chest! But I&#039;m *not* an alien!&quot; 
I have nothing but respect and awe for your obsession. :)]]></description>
