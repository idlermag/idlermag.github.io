					<description><![CDATA[Dude, there&#039;s a word for Von Trier. It&#039;s &quot;sadist,&quot; in both the conventional and a literary sense. He builds his work on inflicting pain on his characters, actors, and audience. This doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s not saying something in his work. I&#039;m looking forward to seeing what you have to say about &quot;Antichrist,&quot; but it means that we have to take him seriously when he says that he&#039;s a Nazi and figure out what that means in the context of his work. And be ready for the answer to not be pretty.]]></description>
