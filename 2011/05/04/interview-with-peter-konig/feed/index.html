					<description><![CDATA[[...] I&#8217;ve been looking forward to posting about this interview, because it was such a fun one for me to have to opportunity to conduct. Peter Konig is a charming and delightful guy, in addition to being an amazing talent. He&#8217;s a visual effects artist, conceptual designer and animator who&#8217;s contributed to such films as Dragonheart (1996), Starship Troopers (1997), Enchanted (2007), Cloverfield (2008) and Splice (2009), as well as the video games Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2. Peter is also an accomplished fine artist, and it was wonderful to learn a little more about that side of his work. Especially if you&#8217;re an artist, sculptor or interested in film effects or creature design, check the interview out here on The Idler &#8211; Interview: Visual effects artist, conceptual designer and animator Peter Konig [...]]]></description>
