I agree completely. Nolan knows 3D is a gimmick and when you try to shoe-horn it into a film that doesn&#039;t need it, the end product suffers. Inception, arguably, could have had some cool moments in 3D, but it didn&#039;t need them to be an awesome film. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was just talking about this 3D craze phenomena this morning.  
Apparently there are big wigs who are suggesting/trying to have the next Batman movie be 3D.  I&#039;ve heard/read that Nolan is resisting (bless him).  
Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were more than excellent in 2D.  That said, there will be PLENTY of people who will race to theaters to see the next installment, but I have to believe there would be quite a few of those who would slow down or drop out of that race if it were in 3D.  3D, to me, is now the branding of a sell-out and I really want no part of it.
Jaws 3?  Yes, please, re-make the hell out of that shit and have the 3D shark right in my face, I&#039;m for it!  That&#039;s the kind of movie that SHOULD/WOULD need 3D to help it sell.
Nolan&#039;s films sell themselves.  Leave Batman out of it.]]></description>
