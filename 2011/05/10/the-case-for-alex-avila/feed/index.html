					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/05/10/the-case-for-alex-avila/#comment-1450&quot;&gt;John J. Miller&lt;/a&gt;.

He&#039;s really turned a corner, and I think it has something to do with his new stance -- he turns his front shoulder in a bit, so you can see the last number on his jersey as he waits for the pitch. In terms of leadership, well, you can&#039;t make these guys into leaders, but you can nurture the ones who step up. A catcher is a natural leader, and I hope Leyland, et al, let Alex assume that role with minimal interference.

I think it says something about coming from a baseball background, too. Having better coaches, better examples, etc.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While this may sound far-fetched, should the Tigers win their division, or enter the playoffs as a wildcard, Avila would get my vote (would that I had one) for MVP. Yes for reasons like you cite, but also for his statistics (which you also cited in brief, come to think of it.)]]></description>
