					<description><![CDATA[Society has such a bizarre view of eating, food, exercise, and health in general, and I feel like you have really captured it here. I&#039;ve been thin my entire life, in part due to genetics, but to a greater extent due to attempts at maintaining healthy eating and exercise habits. I am continually surprised by the comments that people make on my eating and exercise habits: &quot;Why do you exercise so often? You don&#039;t need to lose any weight!&quot; or &quot;You&#039;re skinny, so one more slice can&#039;t hurt.&quot; Keeping up with a healthy lifestyle is especially hard as a law student, when there is always free food (pizza, soda, and candy most often) and hardly enough time to do anything but go to class and study. Eating right (cooking for myself, rather than ordering take-out) and making the time to exercise have to be at, or near the top, of my priority list &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;. And it pays off--I feel pretty great, considering my high-stress environment. I have energy when I need it and I sleep well at night. &quot;Nothing tastes as good as healthy feels&quot; -- you&#039;re definitely right on this. Fantastic post, Teal.]]></description>
