					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/04/20/in-color/#comment-1398&quot;&gt;Eric&lt;/a&gt;.

It does feel a bit odd to be playing and writing about the first Uncharted when there are two sequels out. But one has to start somewhere. I&#039;m deeply happy to hear that it&#039;s worth plowing through. That sub was awesome enough to keep me going this far, and I know there&#039;s a big twist coming up, but I&#039;ve somehow managed to stay in the dark as to what it is. For now. . .

Thanks for commenting. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was a little disappointed, too, when the pirates showed up in Uncharted. It took some time to get used to the shooting controls, but I stuck with it and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the game. Apparently Uncharted 2 fixes most, if not all, of the first game&#039;s annoyances, but I have yet to play that.]]></description>
