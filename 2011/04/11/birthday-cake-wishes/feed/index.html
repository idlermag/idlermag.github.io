					<description><![CDATA[Well now I absolutely must make you some cookies!  

I&#039;m totally with you on the meal cooked by your mother.  If she&#039;s offering I&#039;ll have my mom cook Hungarian Goulash.  I can make it myself just as well, but it always tastes better when Mom makes it.  Enjoy your pesto and potatoes and motherfucking cake, Jill!  Happy Birthday!]]></description>
