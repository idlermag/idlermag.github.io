Now I will grant that I had not heard the song until the uber-Colbert version and I plan on never hearing the original. 
Ahh Black Swan. My wife watched it the other evening (after I passed out at 8pm) and said it reminded her of Chucky. Chucky. I thought that was great!]]></description>

Mike, I agree.  THAT version, with Colbert, The Roots, Fallon, and Taylor Hicks, I will openly admit:  I dig it.  They made an F minus lyrical crap sandwich into something silly, yet wonderful.  I would dance to it in front of a mirror.

But the original, with it&#039;s monotonous droning of spread &quot;Fryeedayee&quot; vowels and unexciting, uninteresting composition, NO.  No, no, no, no, no.  If I listened to that in front of a mirror I&#039;d likely get all Black Swan on my ass (read: break the mirror and stab myself with a choice shard).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Working in the record store for as long as I did there was a saying I would say to people who were trying to excuse their choices at any given time.
Bascially I&#039;d say, we&#039;ve all got stuff we dance in front of the mirror to and there is no point in fronting like we don&#039;t!
I&#039;ve never heard the original but I have seen the Colbert/Fallon/white haired guy version and I love it.]]></description>

I think I heard that, anyway.  
What&#039;s very interesting is that Ark Music Factory co-founder, Patrice Wilson, is the guy who does the rap in Friday.  He&#039;ll tell people who want to employ AMF&#039;s services to get famous that they&#039;re in it for the wrong reasons (uhm, exactly what other reason would there be?  If you didn&#039;t want some sort of notoriety you wouldn&#039;t be actively putting yourself out there like that), but then puts himself in the video.  What&#039;cha doin&#039; in there, Patrice?  I thought this was supposed to be about the young&#039;uns?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t begrudge Rebecca Black for this. She&#039;s, what, an 8th grader? Didn&#039;t we all dream about being famous at that age? My vitriol is reserved entirely for the Ark Music Factory. They&#039;re the ones who wrote and produced this mess and will do it for anyone whose parents are willing to drop $2K. Sadly, this type of thing is the basis for their entire business model, so there will plenty more where this came from.]]></description>
