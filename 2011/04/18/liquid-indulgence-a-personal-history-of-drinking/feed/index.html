					<description><![CDATA[Great stuff here.  I don&#039;t think that a lot of young drinkers realize how shallow ostracizing non-drinkers comes across.  I made a choice for personal reasons in my early teens not to drink alcohol again.  For my senior year of high school I ended up going to a boarding school in Switzerland where seniors were given drinking permission if their parents signed off on it.  Mine signed, but I decided that saying they didn&#039;t was easier than explaining being a non-drinker.  The first week I was there one of the &quot;cool kids&quot; sat next to me in the dining hall and introduced himself.  When he asked if I had drinking permission and I said no he gave me a sad look and got up and left.]]></description>

Hi John! Thanks so much for the kind words and for reading. I haven&#039;t been cool for some time and no amount of sangria or whiskey is going to change that. And I think I like it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Knowing damn little about good cooking, or...cooking for that matter, I generally glaze over your columns, Jill. But this one really caught my eye. I appreciate the honesty and realistic description of what drinking does to you. One of my favorite books states simply that &quot;Men and women drink because they like the effect produced by alcohol.&quot; So simple, and I missed it several times, and my personal history is far, far more self-indulgent than yours. If someone had described to me years ago the way your writing just described the same, simple message, I might have looked more closely at my own drinking before it turned into a problem beyond my control. I guarantee you--cool can&#039;t touch you. I will even look more closely at your other food-related writing now! Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t drink in high school either! Thanks for your post--I definitely feel the invisible social pressure to drink sometimes, too. I think a lot of young writers glamorize drinking, like it will somehow make them better writers. I don&#039;t really get it. I&#039;d rather not be cool as well!]]></description>
