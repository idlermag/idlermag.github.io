					<description><![CDATA[This is an interesting look at science and policy...and I don&#039;t think your analogy was much of a stretch, either!  For what it&#039;s worth (and it may just be worth a laugh at this point)...I&#039;ve lost my sense of smell as a result of concussions playing college football.  That&#039;s the only immediate impact as I&#039;m still a capable engineer and nonprofit executive.  But there is a part of me (like the climate change debate) that is concerned about the delayed effects.  Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
