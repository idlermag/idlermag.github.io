I&#039;d probably feel differently if I didn&#039;t have such bad luck with stealing. Cid could win my heart, though. I love the pack of cigarettes tucked in the band of his goggles. Also I love goggles. The Cloud/Tifa/Cid combo could have potential. . .]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Glad I helped :D

I don&#039;t dislike Yuffie, as she&#039;s fast and is handy for stealing--and her long range weapons make her useful as a back row spell caster.

As I commented in Andrew&#039;s post, I used Cloud, Yuffie and Cid to beat Disc 1. Cid is one of my favorite characters. Any character that uses his cigarette to light some dynamite (as seen in one of his Limit Breaks) wins my heart. And, there is something oddly endearing about a fallen from grace, would-be astronaut.]]></description>
