					<description><![CDATA[Vincent&#039;s Limit Breaks are part of the reason I gave him the Death Blow materia (with the sniper rifle that had a high hit rate): I could still do physical attacks when his gauge was filled. 

Still, I got tired of him after Cid showed up. I&#039;m using Cloud/Yuffie/Tifa for the moment, but I&#039;m getting tired of the slot machine/luck aspect of her limit breaks, regardless of their power.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Last week, I complained about feeling a bit bogged down, and being saddled with a character like Vincent Valentine who, once you get past the cool emo vibe, can actually get in your way just when you need him most. Since then, I&#8217;ve made my way to one of the side quest areas, Wutai, which is the hometown of the other optional character, Yuffie. Whom I also do not love, and had not been using much.
