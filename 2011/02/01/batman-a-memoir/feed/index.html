I think he could have been no worse than Keaton (who was far better than he had any right to be) if Clooney had been working with a director with a better vision. After all, Clooney &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; Bruce Wayne.]]></description>

I have mixed feelings about The Killing Joke. It&#039;s not Moore&#039;s best, and it&#039;s kind of an odd one-shot. It&#039;s a compelling story about the Joker&#039;s possible origin, but I come away from it with the sense that Moore isn&#039;t really that interested in the Joker. The big come-away, and I think Moore is largely responsible for this, is the sort of romance between Batman and the Joker, although even for that, others have done it better. The one question Moore doesn&#039;t really deal with is why the Joker kills. He&#039;s more a guy who will maim you for a bad pun.

And Brian Bolland is an amazing artist, who, at the same time, I&#039;m not really sure I like. :-)]]></description>

Well, Lauren, I don&#039;t have any pictures of you in your Batgirl costume... maybe you should lay your hands on one and share it with us. :)

Bat-Cat-Ra?  Mayhaps a Halloween costume project?!]]></description>
