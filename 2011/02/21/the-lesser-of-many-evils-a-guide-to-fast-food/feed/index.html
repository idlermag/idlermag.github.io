					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard the same about the child-size meals. When McDonald&#039;s was first opening, the meals for everyone were about the same size as the &quot;child-size&quot; meals and drinks are now. They got larger over the years.

Also, I have to say that I&#039;m a fan of the mobile version of this site. Way better to read on my phone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel like I heard a while ago that the child sizes (drinks in particular, I think) are actually the &quot;correct&quot; portions for adults, or maybe the correct &quot;small&quot;.  Would you agree, Jill?]]></description>
