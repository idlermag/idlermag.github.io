					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/02/18/other-things-may-change-us-but-we-start-and-end-with-family/#comment-1051&quot;&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt;.

I feel like it&#039;s a good movie, but not a great one. It&#039;s carried by it&#039;s director and supporting cast. I don&#039;t think the script is great and Walhberg is far too passive (Both an acting flaw and an inherent flaw in the script).

I have yet to see &quot;127 Hours&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;, &quot;The Kids Are All Right&quot; and &quot;The Social Network&quot;, but the last two are sitting at home as we speak. So far I&#039;ve gotta say I think &quot;The King&#039;s Speech&quot; has it on lock down, with &quot;The Social Network&quot; being it&#039;s only real competition. It&#039;s a great film, but more specifically it&#039;s exactly the kind of film I feel like the Academy gravitates towards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t too interested in this one but I checked it out and I loved it. Watched it twice. Like you mentioned, everything is just very well done. I still have &quot;The King&#039;s Speech&quot; and &quot;127 hours&quot; left to see out of the nominees but right now my feeling is that it&#039;s a toss-up between &quot;The Social Network&quot; and &quot;The Fighter&quot; (with Social Network probably getting the edge).]]></description>
