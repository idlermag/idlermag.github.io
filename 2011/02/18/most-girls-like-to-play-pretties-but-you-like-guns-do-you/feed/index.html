The Academy rules state that if you&#039;re nominated in more than one catagory you get the nod in the spot where you got the most votes. Unfortunately, Miss Steinfeld got more votes for best supporting. The bright side is I think she has a better chance of winning in that catagory. The competition&#039;s a little too stiff for a newcomer in the best actress arena.

As far as the poster goes, that&#039;s simple marketing. Big names mean big bucks. That&#039;s showbiz, sister.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That race for help was IN.TENSE.  A little hard to watch because of that poor horse.  
And I agree: Hailee Steinfeld’s Best Supporting Actress nomination is pure silliness.  It&#039;s HER story, why on earth is it considered a supportive role?  That&#039;s just infuriating.  She&#039;s not even billed along with her co-stars on the poster.  Crimes, I say, CRIMES!]]></description>
