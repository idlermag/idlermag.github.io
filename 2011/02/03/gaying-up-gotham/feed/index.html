Have I mentioned that I love &quot;Elegy&quot;? In no small part because while Kate Kane&#039;s sexuality is integral to the story, it&#039;s not the &lt;i&gt;center&lt;/i&gt; of the story. Greg Rucka takes a secondary, afterthought character (the Batwoman costume design was actually originally pitched connected to returning Barbara Gordon to the Batgirl role), and makes her one of the most interesting part of the oversized DC Universe. So good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/02/03/gaying-up-gotham/#comment-947&quot;&gt;Gavin Craig&lt;/a&gt;.

Strikes Back is on my nightstand waiting to come up in the queue. I&#039;m more excited for it now that I read Batman through queer-colored glasses. I think my exploration of Batman will be an ongoing project. I really want to read Batwoman: Elegy  because I favor strong female leads. 

When this posted yesterday it hit me that I could have included a Luda pun (Get Bat, get back, you don&#039;t know me like that). I can&#039;t believe it didn&#039;t come to me sooner.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re exactly right about Miller&#039;s Dark Knight being dated--it&#039;s very specifically set in the 1980s, from the Letterman/Regan cameos, to the local news man-on-the-street TV talking heads, and the point/counterpoint arguments. It&#039;s a weird weakness and strength of the whole thing.

The sequel--Dark Knight Strikes Back tries to go one step further, with shorter soundbytes, more extreme media personas, and (kind of) the internet. But what you come away with is that Miller understands TV. He doesn&#039;t really understand the web. The computer-done colors are incredible, though (often a crutch for sometimes lazy/rushed art), and an interesting contrast to the hand-done, color-wash colors of Dark Knight Returns.]]></description>
