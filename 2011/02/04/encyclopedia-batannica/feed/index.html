					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/02/04/encyclopedia-batannica/#comment-950&quot;&gt;Gavin Craig&lt;/a&gt;.

And maybe the 1970s-80s &quot;human&quot; Batman (Might be close to your &quot;Balanced Batman&quot; but I read that one as the &lt;i&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/i&gt; Batman, who has a different relationship with the law and police than the 1970s-80s comics) 

- Smart, but not a superhuman intelligence (that is, doesn&#039;t solve a case if there aren&#039;t any clues, and sometimes can&#039;t find his man)
- Operates largely within police procedural limits. Will confront suspects, but often not &quot;arrest&quot; them without proof
- A skilled fighter, but not the martial-arts/ninja master of the 1990s and 2000s (When he talked about the possibility of getting killed by a lucky punk with a gun, it was a real possibility)
- actually took his mask off in the cave, even if he left the tights on
- stories often focused on personal relationships--Jim Gordon, Vicki Vale, Silver St. Cloud, other superheroes
- For a time, actually left the cave in favor of a downtown penthouse, to be closer to the city (especially after Dick Grayson left to go to college)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You missed the 1950s Sci-fi Batman

- actively looks to expand the &quot;costumed adventurer working with the police&quot; model of crimefighting  (encourages, recruits, and/or trains people who seek to emulate him)
- often has trouble communicating with his sidekick (many stories hinge on Batman or Robin being up to something different than what their partner thinks that the other is up to)
- Extremely self-assured (knows the right thing to do and does it)
- Occasionally superpowered due to chemical/energy exposure, unique circumstances, or interdimensional travel
- Loved by the ladies (Batwoman, Julie Madison, etc.) but doesn&#039;t have time for them]]></description>
