					<description><![CDATA[I like your critique of the neuroses surrounding the cult of food--I think that the problem isn&#039;t so much the reduction of food to pleasure, as the subsuming of food into the perpetual desire of the marketplace which is built to overwhelm any individual sense of satisfaction or satiety.

Food should be a pleasure--one&#039;s own pleasure. One that comes with a sense of responsibility (to the sources of one&#039;s food, its preparation, and one&#039;s self) rather than guilt.

Love it. Looking forward to reading more. :-)]]></description>
