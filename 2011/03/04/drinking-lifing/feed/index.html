					<description><![CDATA[I mostly gave up on social drinking toward then end of sophomore year of college, and I haven&#039;t looked back.  Still, though, it&#039;s difficult to give up on the need to consume something while socializing...I prefer &quot;drinks&quot; with friends to mean &quot;coffee or tea&quot; with friends, and while usually cheaper than drinking alcohol, it&#039;s not free and it&#039;s still a crutch of some sort. 

Also, glad to see you on here. Between you, Jill, and Lindsey, this is quickly becoming one of my favorite things to read!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am in almost exactly the same boat as you, Teal.  I constantly imbibed throughout college, and to think of doing that again now that I&#039;m nearly 30 is almost enough to make me sick.  I kept it up until I turned 26, finally realizing that if I couldn&#039;t stop then it would be nothing but trouble for the rest of my days.  And now, a few years beyond, I finally see that all that &quot;social drinking&quot; was never as much fun as I probably perceived it.  I don&#039;t think you are the first person to come to this realization.  And you&#039;re dead on discussing how one should use their time valuably instead of wasting it away on drink.  If only we were more insightful when we were in college... :)  Anyways, thanks for the great piece today.]]></description>
