					<description><![CDATA[I can beat the game at any point right now, and my main party folks (Cloud/Cid/Yuffie) are all at level 70 or higher. 

I did spend some time in the Gelnika, building up my Luck and Dexterity stats. But, I never thought to combine Morph with Slash-All (which I just got this morning from the Ancient Forest). 

I want to try and take out Ruby without KoTR as well, but I may just go beat the game and come back for the extra stuff. I really don&#039;t want to spend time trying to raise a Golden Chocobo.]]></description>
