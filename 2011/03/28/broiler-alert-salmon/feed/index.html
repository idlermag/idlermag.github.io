I should just leave the skin on. But it was pretty enjoyable to just be able to eat it straight out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe!]]></description>

I too love sushi of the salmon variety, especially if it&#039;s spicy. Maybe I&#039;ll try to make sushi (although due to the rush of panic I just got while I wrote that, I&#039;m probably better off leaving that to the professionals).

The best thing about this recipe was the sauce--I made zucchini too and just dumped the extra sauce all over everything. I&#039;m thinking of using it as a salad dressing. 

Thanks for the new recipe! I should try other kinds of fish than salmon. If I&#039;m brave enough.]]></description>

I&#039;d heard the same, although I think I&#039;m extra-sensitive to it. I think about that claim the same way I think about people who say &quot;But you can&#039;t barely taste the onions.&quot; You can.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This sounds delicious... even though I prefer smoked or sushi grade (yes, raw, because I&#039;m a bear) salmon.  
This also reminds me of an Alton Brown recipe I tried long ago: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/red-snapper-en-papillote-recipe/index.html  
It worked very well and was very tasty, but we made too much and I&#039;m weird about left overs sometimes, so it never really worked it&#039;s way into my repertoire of recipes.  Maybe you&#039;d like to give it a shot?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I can second cooking with the skin on. You get a bit of extra flavor, and the fish separates from the skin easily.

My grandfather always used to say that fish shouldn&#039;t smell fishy. If your fish smells fishy, you&#039;re buying a bad fish. He was, of course, correct.]]></description>
