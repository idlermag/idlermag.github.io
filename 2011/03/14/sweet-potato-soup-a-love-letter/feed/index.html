Definitely try it soon! It&#039;s super easy, especially if you can find pre-cut sweet potatoes, and has lots of interesting flavors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow! That Charlie is one super boyfriend!  I can see why you like him and of course he likes your cooking!!
I had butternut squash soup from a box today. It was organic and the easiest thing I could find to make that seemed healthy.  It is time for me to ramp this up a notch and try this soup.  By the way, I know this sounds weird but we had homemade squash soup before with shrimp.  It was fabulous. Wanna trade recipes?]]></description>
