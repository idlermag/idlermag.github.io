That&#039;s GENIUS. Why didn&#039;t I think of that? I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll make it again, mainly for an excuse to read. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Since you could make risotto I figured I could do it too. I made the sweet potato recipe I found on the Real Simple website. It called for a cup of wine and then 3.5 cups of water which left the rice nice and white. Overall it was a little bland so we added more salt, pepper and a few other spices. (The husband threw spices in recklessly, I;m not there yet in my cooking skills. As far as not multitasking went, I got bored while I stirred so I read a book over the pot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It really wasn&#039;t too bad! You both can totally do it. The only thing is that it needs constant babysitting, so don&#039;t try to multitask. Put on some good music and stir away, and maybe use vegetable broth that isn&#039;t brown so it doesn&#039;t look quite so nasty.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Risotto has always scared me, as it seems to take for bloody ever to cook.  But if a fellow amateur can woman up, so can I.  Especially if it can truly be a kick ass one-pot dish in less than 30 minutes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That doesn&#039;t sound too bad!  I get tired of sweet potato dishes about five bites in, probably because sweet potatoes are so chock full of nutrients that my system can&#039;t process what to do with it all, but I&#039;ll have to keep this recipe in mind!  Thanks, Jill!]]></description>
