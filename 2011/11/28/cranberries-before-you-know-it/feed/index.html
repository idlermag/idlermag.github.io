This is a different cranberry recipe than the now-lost complicated one that took days to cook. This one is easy! It&#039;s good, too--even the kids liked it! (here&#039;s the actual recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tart-Cranberry-Onion-Relish-236418)]]></description>

The vinegar recipe! You&#039;d make it sound like you lost that one. I&#039;m excited to try it now. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I totally agree--cranberry sauce is delicious and you can&#039;t have too much of it.

You want an even easier recipe? Try this no-cook version: Take 12oz frozen cranberries and 1 navel orange and toss the whole lot in your blender (yes, rind and all) and blend until chopped into little bits. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar, or more, to taste. Let sit for a few hours at room temperature. Eat. Variation: add in a jalapeno to give it some spiciness. Or add in a couple tablespoons of orange liqueur to make it more organgey. If you&#039;re fussy, zest the orange and throw away the pith, then blend pulp and zest, but I don&#039;t find that necessary.

Also easy, this time involving a stove: 12oz cranberries, 1 chopped onion, 12oz red currant jam, 1/4 cup cider vinegar, 2 tsp sugar. Dump it in a pot, bring to a boil, then simmer until the berries have burst. Let sit for a few hours. Eat!

In other words, yum, cranberry sauce!]]></description>
