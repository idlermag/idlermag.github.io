					<description><![CDATA[While I agree that the creators did not &quot;develop&quot; the character of Ness, I believe this was done to the advantage of the game. Instead of force feeding the player what their avatar is supposed to be feeling, the game allows the player to shape their own identity of Ness, reacting to the characters and situations he comes across in gameplay. This seems fairly obvious and intentional as the game designers meticulously created &quot;life stories&quot; for all the supporting characters. It is hard to believe that they neglected the main character on accident.
As a kid playing this game, it didn&#039;t bother me in the slightest having to use my *gasp imagination to shape how my Ness thought and felt. Perhaps this is why it was so easy to connect with and become the character in the first place, and why this game remains one of my very favorites after all these years.]]></description>
