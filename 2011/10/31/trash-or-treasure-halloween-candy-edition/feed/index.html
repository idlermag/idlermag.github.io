					<description><![CDATA[All right people, those &quot;dark chocolate Milky Ways&quot; have a name. They are Milky Way Midnights, and when they show up in my kids treat-or-treat bags, they are MINE. (Anything dark chocolate just gets skimmed off the top when I do my inspection.)

And yes, circus peanuts are disgusting. Does anyone like them? (Maybe just old people who have big bowls of Werther&#039;s Originals.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Mmmm, Dark Chocolate Milky Ways are awesome.

My list consists of pretty much anything chocolate, except those cheap chocolate coins or foil-wrapped chocolate balls/eggs with the awful flavored chocolate...  Starburst and Skittles and Sour Patch Kids are pretty high on the list, too, despite their lack of chocolate.  :)

I am disappointed, though.  You mentioned candy corn, but you did not mention Circus Peanuts.  Though, admittedly, I am not sure if they make these anymore...  I swear they are made out of styrofoam, so maybe they finally did away with the awful things.
