										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>What the %$#! Happened to Comics?</p></blockquote>
<p>With these five words (and four cleverly chosen symbols) began a fascinatingly unique event in comics history. Under the shadow of the massive NATO conference that overtook the Windy City for the weekend of May 18-20, the University of Chicago mounted a historic meeting of the minds entitled <em><a href="http://graycentercomicscon.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Comics: Philosophy and Practice</a></em>. An academic gathering designed to further the development of “transformative collaborations between scholars and artists,” <em>Comics</em> is but the first in an annual series of such conferences. Sponsored by the University’s new arts initiative, the event was housed in the brand new, ultra-modern Center for the Arts, erected on the staid South Side campus and jutting into the sky like an empathetic doodle itself. Most of the weekend’s program centered on dialogues or panel discussions between professorial staff at the University and a fleet of the industry’s most successful cartoonists with careers spread out over decades. Featured guests included Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Ivan Brunetti, Charles Burns, Daniel Clowes, Phoebe Gloeckner, Justin Green, Ben Katchor, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Françoise Mouly, Gary Panter, Joe Sacco, Seth, Art Spiegelman, Carol Tyler, Chris Ware, and the one-and-only R. Crumb.</p>
<p>I have to admit that my proudest moment that weekend was actually being able to utter four complete intelligible words to Robert Crumb directly — without a single stammer or faint head. Here was one of the legends of comic art of the last fifty years standing next to me and I held my cool. To be fair, those four words were something like, “The bathroom’s over there,” but I managed to get them all out as if the guy was just <em>anybody</em>. And honestly, what surprised me most about the weekend was just how intimate the occasion was. Far from a stuffy academic symposium or hurried book signing, <em>Comics</em> seemed to quickly develop into a sacred space where camaraderie between cartoonist and audience was palpable. Young aspiring cartoonists from the university’s own art program mingled with English department scholars, while lucky fans of cartoon history rubbed shoulders with donors and the guests of honor themselves. And it felt like something we all had equal stake in, somehow. More than once during the panel discussions did the artists themselves comment that this was really a unique opportunity to speak to one another — and share just what an influence they’ve been on each other.</p>
<p>In some sense, <em>Comics</em> was an interesting collision of realities for those artists whose autobiographies grew almost unilaterally out of a sense of personal isolation. Every cartoonist present began their careers with overwhelming personal anonymity and a craving to express their experience of the world on the page. But the lines that would eventually converge to create such seminal works as <em>Maus</em> (Art Spiegelman) or <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em> (Alison Bechdel) carry with them the power to humanize or dehumanize, idealize features or exaggerate flaws. In actuality, to hear some talk verbally about themselves can seem almost more detached than what appears on drawn pages. Whether the subject is Palestinian relations with Israel (as in Joe Sacco’s <em>Palestine</em>) or Robert Crumb’s own self-portraiture in panel and word balloon, there’s an honesty to the page itself that transcends words alone. At the same time, comics defy objectivity in a way discussion never can. These women and men tell stories through the graphic novel because it brings something into relief about a situation without having to pretend its absolute veracity. The artist is both a translator of and distiller to an essential truth we’re all drawn into when reading.</p>

<p>That commonality we experience in isolation was a running theme in more than one featured cartoonist’s work that weekend, but especially stands out in the work of Robert Crumb. While Crumb is perhaps most famous for a certain salaciousness in art style, reaping criticism for sexist and racist portrayals going back to his founding of the underground comics movement, his autobiographical comic strips stand out as singularly honest and self-reflective. Today, Crumb has no compunction about describing his adolescent self as a maladjusted geek, but the sincerity with which he has depicted that reality in drawings over a long career speaks louder than the statement itself. Crumb’s figure of himself in solitude and hapless loneliness exhibits a rawness that I have only seen reflected to the same degree in one other great cartoonist’s work of the last century: Charles Schultz.</p>

<p>Charles Schultz’ self portrait in the visage of famous <em>Peanuts</em> character Charlie Brown may be seen as a more innocent take on the human condition, but the similarities are not to be missed with Crumb’s work. Once you peel away the influences of a post-World War II desire to reclaim innocence in the wake of wartime trauma, Charlie Brown represents the solitary figure for the 1950s in much the same way Robert Crumb does for a more sexually revolutionary time twenty years later. Early volumes of <em>The Complete Peanuts</em>, carefully curated by Fantagraphics Books, show a much more contemplative and worldly figure than the one who would be seeking out the Great Pumpkin by the time I learned to read. Charlie Brown was alternately sought out for consolation, and rejected by all those around him in sharp, humorless fashion. Both a trickster at times and a chronic worrier, he mirrors Schultz’s own childhood as a shy, self-conscious kid tormented by bullies and authority figures, with a curious mind and a deep internal world that would eventually spill out onto the page.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9922" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/07/drawn-in/in3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/in3.jpg" data-orig-size="630,327" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="In3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/in3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/in3.jpg?w=630" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/in3.jpg?w=640" alt="Crumb walking" title="In3"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9922" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/in3.jpg 630w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/in3.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/in3.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>I often wonder, if Charlie Brown had been allowed to age in real-time, and grown into adolescence side-by-side with Robert Crumb, would he appear to be a similar lanky figure of self-disappointment and aggrandizement? Rather than growing more culturally safe year after year, the <em>Peanuts</em> gang might have faced the late sixties with the awakening and awkwardness of young adults fumbling about in a search for truth wherever they were told it couldn’t exist by the authority figures of the time. This alternate universe might not have made the newspaper syndicates happy, but it undoubtedly would have been revolutionary in much the same way Crumb’s work remains to this day.</p>
<p>Lynda Barry theorized that, like Charlie Brown frozen at pre-pubescence, adults who stop drawing at a young age never lose the perfection of their style. No matter how well a kid can draw before abandoning it for girls, boys, cars or a job, it always remains in the same condition in which it was left. Sure, those who don’t forsake drawing for culturally more appropriate activities may be doomed to a life of suffering for their art, they also get the opportunity to put something out into the world in a way few others ever can. Robert Crumb’s self-depictions have certainly evolved over the last forty-plus years, but to this day each comic he publishes encourages more and more artists to draw their own lives. Sitting next to many of these cartoonists professing as much in front of a crowd of onlookers, Crumb remained as self-deprecating — yet full of swagger — as the work itself in stating, “It’s only lines on paper, folks!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween is absolutely my favorite holiday.  Costumes, candy, and best of all, lots of terrific classic scary movies and Halloween specials! Back in the day Sister and I would come home from trick-or-treating to a warm house where we’d salivate in anticipation while our parents checked our candy.  We’d darken the living room and switch on the TV to watch glorious Halloween broadcasts without which it just wouldn’t have been Halloween.  Thanks to the magic of YouTube I’ve been able to re-watch my favorite specials as recently as this past Sunday.  I felt like a giddy little kid again, but as an adult I had some thoughts I’m very certain never crossed my tiny child mind.  Here are my favorite childhood specials and my adult reactions to them.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Halloween That Almost Wasn’t</strong></em></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHtzNeMsFek?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>The news in Transylvania is it’s not Halloween unless the Witch rides over the moon at midnight, but she doesn’t fucking want to!  Can Dracula, leader of the monsters and the rest of the gang change her mind before a two-thousand-year-old tradition is put to an end??</p>
<p>GASP!</p>
<p>For as long as we knew of it, and for as many years that it aired, Sister and I had a tradition of watching this special every year after trick-or-treating.  It was absolutely our favorite.  Dracula was chock full of wise cracks and Igor (as played by the late, great Henry Gibson) was the perfect bumbling sidekick (also, there’s a tap dancing Frankenstein!).  Once it was over Sister and I would eat our candy and role-play the show, taking turns switching parts, quoting lines and squeezing every last ounce of fun from the remainder of the night.</p>
<p>Adult reactions:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Some killjoy doesn’t fly over the moon and suddenly no more Halloween?  Psssht!  There will always be a Halloween as long as adults enable children to beg strangers for candy!  Nut up, Transylvania!</li>
<li>Also, WTF, Witch?  You were bitching about how you’re tired of being ugly, but in the final scene you transform into a gorgeous blonde!  Uhm, yeah, hi, did you not know you could perform magic on yourself before the disco party?  (Did I mention this special ends with a disco party?  YEAH.  It’s the best!  You’re welcome!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Garfield’s Halloween Adventure</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q2rngJ7RDU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>Garfield and Odie are trick-or-treating!  In pursuit of more candy they cross a river to find a creepy old house with a creepy old man inside who tells them ghost pirates are on their way!</p>
<p>I loved Garfield when I was a kid, and I would go out of my tiny mind with excitement watching this.  It’s lighthearted, but I was genuinely terrified of the ghosts who are onscreen for all of about 90 seconds.  The soundtrack does a lot to heighten the fear.  It’s a masterpiece, really.</p>
<p>Adult reaction:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Until shit gets real, Garfield’s got a snarky remark for almost everything, and I remember quoting lines from this cartoon all the time. This must have been how I developed the “humor as a defense mechanism” thing.</li>
<li>ALSO, still scared of the old man and the ghost pirates.  Seriously creeps me out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>It’s The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tIhwITwhSg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Charlie Brown is depressed as per usual (though I would be too if I kept getting rocks instead of candy), and Linus insists on waiting for The Great Pumpkin to rise up out of the pumpkin patch and bring toys to all the good little boys and girls (why have we never embraced this idea?!  It’s awesome!)</p>
<p>Sadly, it is not on YouTube in its entirety.  I happen to own the DVD.  My heart aches for you if you are without it.  Absolutely a classic!</p>
<p>Adult reaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching Lucy and Linus carving the jack-o-lantern was always my favorite part, along with Snoopy as the World War I Flying Ace.  Watching him roam the French countryside after his Sopwith Camel is shot down was always super eerie for me.</li>
<li>Also, someone call Lucy a bitch, please?  Just once?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Mr. Boogedy</em></strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/61pIr7s_y_Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>A family moves into a spooky house haunted by the ghost of a mean pilgrim with a magic cloak straight from Satan’s wardrobe!  It’s a Disney Sunday Family movie starring John Astin (<em>The Addams Family</em>), Kristy Swanson (<em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>), a wee David Faustino (<em>Married with Children</em>), Katherine Kelly Lang (<em>The Bold and the Beautiful</em>), Benjamin Gregory  (<em>ALF</em>), and Richard Masur (or, as I know him, the guy whose head ends up in the library mini-fridge in <em>IT</em>).</p>
<p>Adult Reaction:  </p>
<ul>
<li>What they’ve got is a run of the mill poltergeist.  Call a priest.</li>
<li>The kids go to the local Historical Society to find out the history of the house.  John Astin tells them the tale via an old pop up book.  Seriously?  Someone made a pop-up book about a sadistic pilgrim?</li>
<li>Worst parents in the world.  The dad’s in the gag business and can’t take anything seriously, not even the genuine fears of his own children, and continues to antagonize them for cheap laughs.</li>
<li>Mr. Boogedy bewitches a vacuum cleaner to chase a kid and it ends up sucking up his own magic cloak, defeating him.  Again, can you not do magic?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disney Halloween Specials</strong></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rYXp4kkaYSw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe> </p>
<p>These were compilations of anything that might have ever been spooky about Disney ever.  The Magic Mirror would host the segments concerning the classic scenes with the classic villains, which, let’s face it, are the highlight of most Disney movies.</p>
<p>Original shorts would be featured too.  My favorite being <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2muJDGdakCc" target="_blank">The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</a> as narrated by Bing Crosby (skip to 3:30 in Part 3 to get to the good stuff!).  We had this on vinyl too, but something about watching a flaming jack-o-lantern fly at the screen was the epitome of spooksville for me. If you want to listen to the LP, Vinyl Whores have posted it <a href="http://vinylwhores.blogspot.com/2011/10/very-vinyl-whores-halloween-legend-of.html" target="_blank">here</a> along with the videos.  I can’t tell if the popping on the LP audio is just the record, or if it’s supposed to sound like a crackling fire for effect.  Either way it induced quite a bit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Adult reaction:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Villainesses are BAD. ASS.  Maleficent, baby, I’m looking RIGHT. AT. YOU.</li>
<li>Donald Duck is an asshole of an Uncle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the Halloween specials I will always love.  What are yours?  Have I missed something awesome?</p>
