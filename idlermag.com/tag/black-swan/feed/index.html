										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Black Swan poster" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.onlinemovieshut.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/black-swan-movie-poster.jpg" alt="" width="231" height="342" />It’s wet, cold and icy and I’m on my way to the Main Art Theatre in Royal Oak to see <em>Black Swan</em>. I shouldn’t be out, but there are ten friggin’ best picture nominees and I’ve got to get rolling. Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow.</p>
<p>I shake off the cold (and the rage I feel when a single droplet of ice water crashes down onto my head, seemingly piercing my skull and trickling down my spine, leaving behind an icy cold pain in its wake) and meet a friend of mine in the lobby. She’s my go-to companion for these types of art house films because they depress my wife.</p>
<p>Sometimes a film hits you differently when you’re in a mood, and it turns out that the tension of my drive in, the icy cold and my run in with that water droplet scud missile might have put me in the perfect frame of mind for Darren Aronovsky’s hyper-tense, psycho-sexual ballet thriller. Now <em>that’s</em> a subgenre!</p>
<p><em>Black Swan</em> tells the story of Nina (Natalie Portman), a young ballerina vying for the dual lead role in Tchaikovsky’s <em>Swan</em><em> Lake</em><em> </em>as both the white and black swan. Her instructor, Thomas Leroy, played with lecherous arrogance by Vincent Cassel, informs her that while she is perfect for the demure, trepedatious white swan, her inhibitions keeps her from perfecting the freer spirited black swan. He seems more than willing to give her some tips on how she might lighten up (wink wink). What a guy.</p>
<p>Soon, a dancer named Lily (Mila Kunis) begins to move from Nina’s peripheral to her cross hairs as her only real rival for the part of the black swan. Lily, it seems, is exactly the kind of undisciplined, highly sexual dancer Leroy is looking for. Too repressed to start hair pulling and name calling, Nina begins to hallucinate. Or does she?</p>
<p>The true success of <em>Black Swan</em> lies in Aronovsky and Portman’s commitment to its madness. The story (and Nina) is clearly a bit over-the-top, but Portman’s performance is fearless. Her Nina is the epitome of fragility. She is tightly wound, a staunch perfectionist in her movements, always appearing to be on the verge on tears. Her decent into madness isn’t so much a steady decline as a dash down Splash Mountain. Aronovsky keeps us in her head with tight close ups, a camera that almost never strays from Nina and a ramped up soundtrack (Seriously, everything from her footsteps to her breathing, as well as a few more unpleasant sounds, is palpable).</p>
<p>The film heads where it heads with no detours and it relies on the viewer’s willingness to take the ride. The minute you begin to question it, <em>Black Swan’s</em> lost you. It is big. It is melodramatic. But so is ballet and, more to point, that’s how Nina perceives it. This is not about a role; it’s about life and death.</p>
<p><strong>Black Swan <em>is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress in a leading role (Natalie Portman), Best Cinematography (Matthew Libatique) &amp; Best Director (Darren Aronovsky)</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="Armand White, Film Critic" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/critic.jpg?w=180&#038;h=167" alt="" width="180" height="167" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Armond White, crusader against hipster nihilism</p></div>
<p>Those unfamiliar with <em>New York Press</em> film critic Armond White owe themselves a stop at his rottentomatoes.com <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/armond-white/">profile</a>.  White, notorious for his contrarian, strange and often needlessly venomous reviews (he called <em>Dinner for Schmucks</em> an &#8220;idiot film for idiots&#8221;), recently hosted the 76<sup>th</sup> annual New York Critics Circle awards dinner, where he exchanged some very public words with the likes of Darren Aronofsky and Noah Baumbach.  I will refrain from going into detail (<a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/01/11/armond-white-darren-aronofsky-nyfcc-awards/" target="new">you can follow this link for that</a>), but the unfortunate incident did remind me of a piece I had written “back in the day” regarding my own feelings about the purpose of the film critic and film criticism itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>The bottom line is this: No one with half a brain has ever avoided a film simply because a critic said it was no good.   Film criticism is not meant as a means to avoid &#8220;bad&#8221; films because, after all, what exactly is a &#8220;bad&#8221; film?  One man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure, and what if I just wanted to make popcorn and watch a few cars explode?  Or watch a zombies devour the flesh of their victims?</p>
<p>No, film criticism is, and always has been merely a means to start a dialogue.  There will always be a market for that.   A.O. Scott, who co-hosted &#8220;At the Movies&#8221; in its final season with Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune, recently published an article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/movies/04scott.html?scp=2&amp;sq=a%20critics%20place&amp;st=cse" target="new">New York Times</a> regarding the very same idea:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;How can you do a movie justice in 60 seconds? You can&#8217;t, of course &#8211; or in 800 words, or in a blog post &#8211; but you can start a conversation, advance or rebut an argument, and give people who share your interest something to talk about.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>At his or her best, a critic should make you think about a film in a way you may not have on your own.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I just blockquoted myself.  What up?</p>
<div style="width: 318px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="   " title="Nina, Black Swan" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.hollywoodnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Black-Swan-Natalie-Portman-in-Double-Trouble.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="166" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh Nina, if only you weren&#039;t in ethnic denial</p></div>
<p>Seriously though, I feel as though Mr. White may have forgotten himself.  I mean, regardless of how you feel about Aronofsky&#8217;s ballet themed psycho-thriller <em>The Black Swan</em>, I think we can all agree that White&#8217;s critique that its “ethnic denial and escape into Nina’s psychological trauma actually trivializes her artistic pursuit” should be met with a resounding “wha?”</p>
<p>Or how about his review of <em>Resident Evil: Afterlife</em>, in which he states that &#8220;if critics and fanboys weren&#8217;t suckers for simplistic nihilism and high pressure marketing, <em>Afterlife</em> would be universally acclaimed as a visionary feat, superior to <em>Inception</em> and <em>Avatar</em>&#8220;?  Wow.  He even condemns both <em>Let me in</em> for its &#8220;nihilistic indulgences&#8221; and <em>The Dark Knight</em> for &#8220;pandering to hip, nihilistic tendencies.&#8221;  The man hates nihilism.  Give a shit, Hollywood!</p>
<p>Okay, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Kevin, didn&#8217;t you just blockquote your awesome self as saying &#8220;one man&#8217;s trash is another man&#8217;s treasure?&#8221; and &#8220;What exactly is a bad film?&#8221;  Fair enough.  So I clearly don&#8217;t agree with White&#8217;s abstract, intentionally argumentative criticisms (in my humble opinion, of course).  Let&#8217;s put that aside and get back to the shenanigans he pulled at the awards ceremony, which I believe overstepped the bounds of a film critic and of pure, simple good manners.  Not liking a film is one thing, childishly throwing verbal barbs at the film&#8217;s creators in front of a live audience is quite another.</p>
<p>What Armond White seems to have forgotten is that a film critic is judging a piece of art created by not one, but several other people.  It is a tremendously difficult, time-consuming project.  Directors, writers, producers, actors, etc. all put their heart into their work.  Sometimes they fail, but one must always remain mindful that even the worst films have a certain passion behind them (check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDblLBLXu0c" target="new">interviews with the director of Troll 2</a> if you don&#8217;t believe me) and that should be respected.  Mocking something in the safety of your own home or amongst friends is very different than publicly calling someone out.</p>
