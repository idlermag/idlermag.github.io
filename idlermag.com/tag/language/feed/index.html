										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After finishing <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/07/09/convalescence-and-counting-calories/" target="_blank">my eating plan</a>, I promptly went up north with my family and boomeranged in the other direction. The cottage up north is a land filled with Cheetos and licorice and s’mores and beer. Our altar is the kitchen counter. It’s one of my favorite things about the cottage. But after doing my eating plan, my senses were attuned to the way we talk and think about food and our bodies. None of the men apologized for having some licorice or some chips with their sandwich. All of the women did. We apologized to each other or to ourselves or to the world.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have these cookies. But fuck it, I’m on vacation!”</p>
<p>“I don’t even want these chips. But I’m eating them anyway.”</p>
<p>“I should go running after this. But instead I’ll just be fat!”</p>
<p>We were transgressors. Inwardly I patted myself on the back like some kind of smug asshole for having the light beer or for drinking water instead of pop. <em>You don’t want to get fat</em>, I tell myself. As if getting fat is a disease you can catch; as if it’s the worst thing that could happen. I don’t own a scale and never really set much store by the numbers anyway &#8212; I’m a tallish and a little muscular, so striving for any number is never something I cared about.</p>
<p>Instead, I found other ways to care. I measure with my fingers how much fat does or does not spill over the front of my pants or how much my jeans fold around my thighs. I pinch the undersides of my arms to see how soft they are. I feel for my collarbone. I didn’t even realize I was doing it or that it’s a problem behavior until I heard it named online: “body-checking.” I was physically measuring my imperfections, checking to see if the disease had spread.</p>
<p>What was I afraid of? Why was I so afraid? I was a twiggy little kid. I grew up with a mother who ate healthily and exercised, but who was always loving and <em>never</em> shaming, never said anything negative about my body or appearance. I was occasionally teased for my crooked teeth or ridiculous hair, but only in the way that kids are sometimes mean, never to the extent of cruelty or bullying.</p>
<p>I watched and learned from the way other girls were treated that fat was bad. Fat was ugly. Fat was something I never wanted to be. With my frizzy hair and braces, I already had two things that the pretty girls did not have.  I was average-looking. If I got fat, I knew I’d be officially ugly. (I know this sort of thing inspires a chorus of people saying nice and reassuring things, which is so kind, but I am really not fishing for compliments. That was how I saw the world. I observed and paid attention and learned who was considered pretty and who wasn’t, and knew I was somewhere muddled in between.)</p>
<p>I figured that, if I could only stay thin, I could have a chance at being pretty. I’m grateful I have never crossed into eating disorder or excessive exercise territory. I never needed to be stick thin and I wanted to be strong. But I still spent plenty of time hating myself for the paunch on my stomach or the way my inner thighs always touched no matter how many squats I did. When I said, “I’m fat” or “I feel fat,” what I really meant was that I felt ugly. <em>Fat</em> was a bad word. (AN F-WORD IF YOU WILL.)</p>
<p>And then one of my friends said the following: “PSA: Using the word ‘fat’ to describe yourself when you are not actually fat (a yardstick is being able to shop in non-specialty mall stores) is kind of rude. As someone who has actually faced real, tangible, public discrimination for being fat, I would really appreciate it if we could put a hold on that word.” And then I started doing some thinking and doing some research. I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XhTA4xOxCc" target="_blank">this video</a>. (HI IF YOU DON’T READ ANY OF THIS, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY JUST WATCH THIS VIDEO.) And I realized I was being a huge asshole (if unintentionally) to others and to myself. It never occurred to me that when I’m lost in my own neuroses, I could be hurting other people. All my fat-hate had been focused on myself and <em>never</em> on others, but it didn’t matter. I’d been using the word <em>fat</em> as a scapegoat, which is really just as awful and discriminatory as using the word <em>gay</em> to mean that something is bad or stupid.</p>
<p>So I’m trying to retrain myself. I’m trying to teach myself that <em>fat</em> is not a bad word. <em>Fat</em> is not an insult and shouldn’t be used as one, whether toward myself or toward others. <em>Fat</em> does not mean ugly or lazy or stupid or mean. Fat is fat. Some people are fat. I have some fat on my body. You can be fat and be still healthy. Being fat does not mean you’re ugly &#8212; my lovely friend who helped me to start thinking about these things is gorgeous as hell.</p>
<p>It’s difficult. It’s really difficult. But especially as a writer, I want to be conscious of what words mean and how I use them and try to not use them to harm myself or others. And fuck apologizing for that extra slice of pizza.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a sojourner in a strange land. I started alone, climbing a sand dune to catch my first glimpse of a mountain with a brilliant light glowing at its peak. As I walked toward the mountain, I encountered a glowing mark which wrapped itself around my neck and gave me the ability to float through the air. I found living scraps of fabric which carried me to a platform where I closed my eyes and saw a figure in white.</p>
<p>That figure would return as I moved forward to show me the story of the world and the people who came before me.</p>
<p>There is a balance every narrative game has to find between what the game gives you, and what it leaves for you to find. My first trip through the game was carried almost entirely by what was given. There was the experience of the world as I traveled through it, and there was the story of the world as revealed in the visions/cutscenes between levels. Every vision showed a little bit of where I had been, a little bit of where I was to go next, and a little bit of what had happened. It&#8217;s brilliantly difficult to be more specific than that, as the visions are images entirely free of text.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on writing. The visions are iconographic &#8212; the graphemes it uses are representations of embodiment and embodied action, and like all representation, it operates by demanding interpretation. The revealed story &#8212; the story communicated through the visions &#8212; is perfectly clear and perfectly ambiguous. Life, living cloth, both flora and fauna, emanate from the energy of the mountain. People begin to direct energy, first into greater cloths, and then into structures which use cloths as energy sources. The people attain great heights, and then the energy starts to flicker. There is a tearing of the cloth. New, terrible machines are built under storm and cloud. The world is covered in sand. A single traveler appears, and moves through the ruins of the world to the mountain.</p>
<p>All of this is recorded. All of this is shown. None of it is explained. None of it has meaning independent of the traveler and the player&#8217;s experience. The traveler reconstructs the story by moving to a place in the world where a new chapter can be told. While the story, like all stories, is dependent on an imagined past, the play itself re-creates the story from the very first play. Without the traveler, without the reader, without the player, the writing is just an encoded possibility, a hope for a story. Every book, every game, every story is a ghost, a trace, a breath waiting for a body to enliven.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was a companion. I was initially indifferent to others. The game has a trophy given when the player encounters 10 other players within the game. I earned this trophy on my first playthrough, as I moved forward and left other players behind. The second time, however, I met a traveler in a white robe.</p>
<p>Unlike most games with online multiplayer functionality, <em>Journey</em> doesn&#8217;t give players a way to talk to each other using voice or text. Instead, you can press a button to make a noise (which varies in tune with the game&#8217;s soundtrack) and create a single luminescent glyph.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on language. Because you can &#8220;talk&#8221; quietly or loudly by tapping the button lightly or holding it down with greater pressure, the game&#8217;s single hailing action can be incredibly expressive. I soon realized that the other traveler was calling my attention to places in the world I should explore. I found new ruins, hidden flowers, and secret glyphs which added to the story told in the visions. We had a way to acknowledge each other, to keep track of each other, and, most interesting of all, to chatter. Sometimes our speech had a clear purpose &#8212; &#8220;Come over here!&#8221; &#8220;Thanks&#8221; &#8220;Can you see me?&#8221; &#8212; but sometimes it was more a way to share excitement, or nervousness, or wonder. That is, it was a conversation in which clear communication was taking place, but in which that communication was entirely indifferent to individual words. It was a striking reminder of how much of a conversation is carried by tone and context rather than grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>As we moved through the world, the traveler taught me, and I was able to say thank you. In the moments of greatest beauty, we sang to each other. We were not only acknowledging each other, but acknowledging the world, and participating in it.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I returned to <em>Journey</em> after my two complete playthroughs for a number of smaller, partial attempts. After the game is completed, the end of the first, tutorial level becomes a gateway where the player can jump to any of the later levels, rather than having to play the whole game in order. I collected the glowing symbols I had missed. I found the final hidden glyphs. I earned a white robe of my own. I tried and failed to take on the role of teacher.</p>
<p>So the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I put the robe away. I gave up the external signs of experience, and simply entered the world again.</p>
<p>There is an entire meditation, in <em>Journey</em>, on humility. While the story is dependent upon the player as a reader, an actor, a participant, the world itself endures unchanged. In most games, replay value is measured by variability of outcome &#8212; different choices resulting in a different story, different actions leading to a higher score. <em>Journey</em> has no score, and the world, the symbols, the glyphs, the visions, and the outcome are the same every time. You may approach the mountain alone or with a companion, clothed in brown or white, with a long flowing scarf or with almost no scarf at all. The mountain always strips all of these things away. The end is always the same.</p>
<p>And yet <em>Journey</em> is the only video game I can think of which I&#8217;ve played from beginning to end three times.</p>
<p>And the third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I met a traveler. Somehow, I was better as a guide in the brown robe instead of the white, and I showed my companion the better paths. As we approached the mountain, in the final wind and snow, we were separated, and I did something I had never done before. I waited. When my companion was blown from the path, I sat in one place so that she could climb back and we could finish the journey together. Even then, somehow, she got ahead of me without my having seen her, and I found myself rising to catch up. I&#8217;m still not sure if I was mistaken somehow about her having lost the path, or if I was inattentive, or if she found a new way. None of these things seems likely, but I know for certain that we were separated and found each other further ahead. My patience, apparently, was nothing compared to my companion&#8217;s, as she waited for me to finish waiting for her. We entered the mountain together, to begin again, alone.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The first time I played <em>Journey</em>, I saw the world.</p>
<p>The second time I played <em>Journey</em>, I learned the language.</p>
<p>The third time I played <em>Journey</em>, I was part of the world.</p>
<p>I may yet return.</p>
