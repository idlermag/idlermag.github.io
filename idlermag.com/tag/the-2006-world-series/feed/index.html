										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cardinal Dreams</strong></p>
<p>1.<br />
Firebird, Thunderbird, Sunbird<br />
they all seemed the same to me<br />
their headlights like eyes<br />
unmoving, blank.  </p>
<p>2.<br />
The Phoenix Center in downtown Pontiac,<br />
somewhere near the Fiero plant and Fischer Body<br />
where Johnny Cash worked three weeks<br />
alongside Abuelito, building the 1951 models. </p>
<p>3.<br />
Johnny Cash joining the Air Force, Abuelito’s<br />
old Aztec thunderbird medallion curling<br />
into his chest hair<br />
those years after the war,<br />
open shirt, asleep on the couch<br />
with the afternoon game on, his mammoth<br />
cherries jubilee Cadillac parked in the driveway, </p>
<p>4.<br />
four years old when he jumps off<br />
the couch and the Tigers take the World Series,<br />
tugging at his pant leg<br />
and repeating what I think is the name<br />
of his automobile </p>
<p>5.<br />
car-din-al. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Once I dreamed a cardinal:<br />
on a power line<br />
bisecting a dying oak<br />
in the front yard of the home<br />
I was leaving</p>
<p>Sean Casey’s calf muscle snapping<br />
as a taut electrical wire in Game Two</p>
<p>my Abuelita when she discovered<br />
the crimson lipstick of her husband’s mistress. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Like a skipping record for days, for weeks<br />
I look out the front window<br />
of the house on Allen St.<br />
three perfectly equal wooden frames<br />
stained dark a hundred years before<br />
spinning tires.</p>
<p>8.<br />
Through the wood<br />
of the frames/ through the glass and the branches<br />
of the three story oak to the transmission lines<br />
on the other side – it is the same every time. </p>
<p>One cardinal</p>
<p>motionless</p>
<p>balanced on a wire. </p>
<p>9.<br />
In the dream is it clear, the facts are unquestionable:<br />
I’ve seen this same bird,<br />
	fixing its tiny<br />
	repeating record eyes on me until I wake,<br />
hundreds of times/</p>
<p>I cannot remember<br />
if I’ve seen the bird/<br />
awake. </p>
<p>10.<br />
It’s the baseball day-<br />
dreams, the two hands of Albert Pujols,<br />
the St. Louis Cardinal </p>
<p>smiling across his jersey, his hands still<br />
as the pitcher begins his motion,<br />
the sublime strain of fabric<br />
along quadriceps.</p>
<p>He’s a man you love even when he breaks you<br />
when the Cardinals take the Series in five<br />
and we go home alone.</p>
<p>12.<br />
The cherries and the cars and the<br />
bird and the tugging were all the same, were all real<br />
or not real, were all some kind of way </p>
<p>to explain what had happened/ what had maybe<br />
never happened, but I cannot speak<br />
when I try to say it, lusting after Pujols </p>
<p>and alone at night and wearing patent red<br />
shoes, imagining myself as Mercury<br />
with the winged heels when I chase the bus,<br />
waving a hand looking into each passing branch.</p>
