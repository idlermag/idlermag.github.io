										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m from Las Cruces, New Mexico, a city populated by around 99,000 people where you can somehow still run into everyone you know at the Super Walmart on Valley Drive and Avenida de Mesilla. It’s the kind of place where high school sports rivalries are king, where teenagers huddle down into a dusty ditch bank and drink watered down beer while fields of cotton grow dry and wooly and the sun bakes the ground into a crack-fissured clay. The weather forecast forms a bingo board of little yellow sunshines, disturbed every once in a good while by thunderous storms that pour in fresh wet stripes punctuated with whipcrack flashes of lightning. </p>
<p>People there talk in funny accents &#8212; a marriage of cool, laid-back, Californian English and dramatically elongated Spanish syllables. One “gets down” from the car to go into the store, and carries the onus of a silly nickname like a mythological birthright. The food is fat with flavor, the culture, thick with artists. Stay long enough and a slow and sleepy boredom seeps deep into your bones, not a boredom that irritates so much as builds a gravity that keeps you in one place, makes you stay &#8212; warm, dream-heavy, happy. When choosing a grad school, I picked faraway places on the map fearing the lotus-eater lull of my beautiful home and an almost genetic tendency toward petrified paralysis. I’ve been working through the cold perspective of living in East Lansing, Michigan for about 10 years, now.</p>
<p>I’d never been to Boston, Massachusetts until a few weeks ago. Everything I knew of the place was a small collage of colonial history, Celtics basketball, the regulars of the downstairs bar, <em>Cheers</em>, and some dramatic scenes from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. (“I gawt huh numbuh&#8211;how bout them ah-pples?”) Representing the non-fiction journal I work for at MSU, I attended a conference for the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) in a complex hamster cage of a hotel conference center/shopping mall in downtown Boston. Imagine thousands of writers anxiously milling about in their scarves and wryly chosen spectacles. Aisle after aisle of booths, books, authors, publishers, editors. In some ways I felt completely at home. Not geographically, per se, but in my seat of comfort and power; I was in a place where my love for literature and language could find friendship and revel in nerdy delights. In other ways I felt completely lost and alienated. Amidst the movement, the clouds of chatter, the thousands of people just like me, I could at times feel dull, null, nil. </p>
<p>The snow outside was falling sideways in wet messy sheets. The streets were puddled with thick ice water ponds much deeper than my sneakered toe could dip. Inside, the conference hummed with body heat and dizzying distraction, the intermingling exhalations of too many mouths.</p>
<p>Making my way through the labyrinthine levels and turns, past the conference center, the Starbucks, the Coach store, beyond the reach of Armani, Louis Vuitton, the kiosks at the mall, down the escalator and across a hidden underpass below the exposed snowy street above, I bought a ticket on the train and booked it to Harvard. Nervous and alone I watched the stops on the map too closely. I focused tightly on the colored lines, the dots for each station, as Boston people populated and detrained the car with an easy indifference.</p>
<p>After trudging through slick muck in Harvard Square for at least twenty minutes, I was cold, lost, and spent, but I found the tattoo shop, finally. My friend’s brother, Sky, was my artist. He’s from my hometown, but I’d never met him. And here we were, together, two desert kids in Massachusetts telling stories of sun, Spanish art, the power of tamales and cholo style. And he was quiet, funny, smart, thoughtful, with a tiny Zia symbol etched behind his ear. A teacher, a maker, an avid Netflixer, much like myself. And he carved a red heart into my forearm, needled in colors of New Mexico sunsets onto the banner, marked my love of TV (with equal parts wink and sincerity) into the geography of my body. When the pain burned hotter and my eyes would roll back away from the whirring, Dia de los Muertos and retablo inspired pieces settled my gaze. We talked about loving a place, our home, and how we could never really go back. Our stories overlapping with the colors he was stitching. Intersecting lines and routes. Mappings. Intersecting lines and roots. </p>
<p>No longer lost, I made my way back to the dirty subway platform, still concrete and grey, still alien, but a little less scary, a little more known. Cold, tired, surrounded by strangers, I carried my new gift home. My heart throbbing in my coat sleeve, hidden, secret, and mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days I live in the nation, but it hasn’t always been so. </p>
<p>Growing up, my father instilled in me a reverence for the things he loved most: John Wayne, pro wrestling, bow hunting, and Detroit baseball. If we weren’t watching <em>Full House</em> or WrestleMania (exclusively for Hulk Hogan) on a lazy summer afternoon we were watching the Tigers. </p>
<p>Throughout my life baseball has been a comfort to me. The dusty cleats on the infield. The perfect white lines. The green, green grass.  The pop of a bat on a home run. The stolen bases. The mustaches. The blue, white, and orange. I love it all. </p>
<p>Last August I moved to the east coast and this spring I experienced my first opening day living in Red Sox nation. On April 8th, the Sox played (and bested) the Yankees at Fenway. That morning a tide of red and white and blue swept through the city. On my morning train I observed a woman done up in devotion with Red Sox shoelaces, jacket, visor, earrings, purse. The fact that she had stopped short of adorning herself in an official uniform was what was truly surprising. </p>
<p>Though I never check the schedule, I always know when the lights will be on at Fenway. On every street downtown a shuffling sea of caps, shirts, and jerseys clogs the bricks of Copley Square from T stop to my destination, where ever it may be.</p>
<p>These people are my friends and coworkers. These people are the people I depend on. They cook the meals, they haul the trash, they connect the calls, they  drive they ambulances. They guard me while I sleep. You do not fuck with them. </p>
<p>It’s an interesting experience, to move from one big sports city to another. To suddenly find yourself watching the Bruins at the bar because the Wings aren’t on. To wake up one day and realize you root for the Celtics, and begin fostering an unrequited love of Glen Davis. To be constantly surrounded by a slew of base-hit reports credited to names you don’t recognize.</p>
<p>Living here is like being in a foreign country &#8212; no one speaks my language and the scores from home get lost in the post.</p>
<p>That Boston is a sports town is some small comfort to me. And their Sox reverence is something it’s hard not to be a bit humbled by. Love or hate the Sox, living in Boston I can’t escape them. Because Fenway Park falls somewhere between my job downtown and my apartment off the green line, evening games mean I can’t get a train home for the better part of an hour. </p>
<p>I watch train after train of excited, B-emblazoned fans roll through Copley station, biding my time, praying for a car with space enough open for a person of my stature. Never in my life have I seen so many single-letter tattoos. I would guess that about 70% of Boston natives over the age of 18 have a Sox tattoo. </p>
<p>In all the time I’ve lived in Boston, nearly a year now, I’ve seen exactly four Detroit Tigers hats. FOUR. One night while waiting for the train I noticed the woman next to me in the most beautiful adjustible navy blue baseball hat, with that pristine white old english D that weakens my knees. In Boston there’s an unspoken rule, fostered by the general rush and meanness of city life that you don’t ask strangers questions that aren’t game scores or directions. But. I. Just. Couldn’t. Help Myself.</p>
<p>I asked this woman if she was from Detroit and all I got in return was a blank stare. “Your hat,” I said. </p>
<p> “No,” she said, “I have some friends there, and I believe people should be able to wear whatever they want.”</p>
<p>“I only ask because I’m from there &#8212; I’m a huge Tigers fan.”</p>
<p>She turned away.</p>
<p>And so it goes. I am a stranger in a strange land. Won’t someone please send me the score?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I turned in this week’s column late because I was laying in my bed on Friday night, unable to move even my fingers to type, and contemplating never eating again. I thought the feeling of hunger was going to become a distant memory. I managed to drag myself out of bed this morning to go for a much, much-needed run and felt the last two weeks of food course through my arteries as my heart tried to pump blood through them. I’m recovering from Restaurant Week.

Every year for two weeks, Bostonians celebrate Restaurant Week, when restaurants all around the city offer fixed-price menus: two-course lunches for $15.10, three course lunches for $22.10, and three-course dinners for $32.10. This means that you get to try restaurants that you’d normally never walk into because their food looks more like art than something you want to ingest, or you can have a three-course meal (minus alcohol, and tip, of course) without falling into poverty for the following few weeks.

I thought the feeling of hunger was going to become a distant memory. I managed to drag myself out of bed this morning to go for a much, much-needed run and felt the last two weeks of food course through my arteries as my heart tried to pump blood through them. I’m recovering from Restaurant Week.</p>
<p>Every year for two weeks, Bostonians celebrate Restaurant Week, when restaurants all around the city offer fixed-price menus: two-course lunches for $15.10, three course lunches for $22.10, and three-course dinners for $32.10. This means that you get to try restaurants that you’d normally never walk into because their food looks more like art than something you want to ingest, or you can have a three-course meal (minus alcohol, and tip, of course) without falling into poverty for the following few weeks.</p>
<p>Being a new Bostonian and generally overzealous about food, I planned three different meals for Restaurant Week. One lunch, two dinners. And I accidentally ended up at another lunch, too. Salad, dinner, dessert, repeat, repeat, repeat. Seafood. Pasta. Tapas. Steak. Even writing this is making me feel a bit disgusted with myself.</p>
<p>Although I’m a little concerned about making rent, I don’t regret eating a single thing. I do regret the money, but I’m young enough to pretend the tiny percentage of my paycheck going into my 401k is less important than a $40 bottle of wine. I got to eat four meals at four- and five-star restaurants and learned some things about etiquette. </p>
<p>For example, when the heavy menus at the dimly-lit Italian restaurant <em>light up</em> with LEDs when you open them, do not squeal with delight. People <em>will</em> look at you. If you are being seated in a busy outdoor patio and a bird happens to shit on your head, do not yell “A fucking bird just shit on my head!” People <em>will</em> stare and your friend will slink to your table and cover her face. The hostess will apologize profusely, as if it’s her fault the bird released its bowels at that particular second. When the waiter pulls the chair out for you, do not try to pull it in yourself as you’re sitting down, even if you’re doing it out of habit. You will almost yank your shoulders out of your sockets and make him uncomfortable because your timing was off. Do not giggle when the waiter snaps the cloth napkin in the air and sets it on your lap, even if you can’t help but laugh at how absurd the idea is. They do not appreciate it.</p>
<p>Because my menu for the week was so extensive, I won’t recount all sixteen plates. I’ll stick with the most memorable. I took my friend Allison, who was visiting Boston for the first time, to Top of the Hub, a restaurant on the 52nd floor of the Prudential Center with a great view of the city. She and I both ordered a chicken and pasta dish with a creamy garlic sauce and peas. I can’t say why I chose this, because I hate peas. It must have sounded good enough to be worth picking around them. </p>
<p>(There is a family story about an incident when I was an 8-year-old, and my mother would not let me leave the table until I finished my peas. I was usually a well-behaved child and hated to displease my parents, especially my mother, but I did not want the peas. I did not see why I <em>had</em> to eat them. So I sat at there by myself while my family left the table. The peas got cold. Darkness fell. My little sister went to bed. And I was <em>not</em> going to eat those peas. Finally, it was my bedtime, and my mom decided to just put me to bed. The moral of this story: I won. Attention kids everywhere: You do not <em>have</em> to eat that.)</p>
<p>When the pasta dish arrived, it was shockingly similar to a dish I had had there a few weeks before. The chef had simply switched out the gnocchi for pasta. It had been three weeks. For such a top-tier restaurant, you would think they could have at least switched to a red sauce. I chose not to tell my friend, and picked around my peas and felt gypped.</p>
<p>We both ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert, and while I was pleased that it was fresh strawberries and not that disgusting pie-filling slime, I’ve had better shortcake at the tiny ice cream parlor in my hometown. And at Cracker Barrel.</p>
<p>Restaurant week was not stepping up. But I was willing to give Restaurant Week one more chance to try and convince me. Would I have a battle with onions? Would I cry because a dessert was <em>that</em> delicious? Read next week and see.</p>
