										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leviathan</em> (2012) straddles the line between documentary and avant-garde; composed entirely from footage shot on a large fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean, it hints at how life is lived on the boat, but exists primarily as a visual and auditory experience. Things happen, but there is no plot; our understanding is entirely derived from the images, sound, and what understanding (little, in my case) we might have of industrial fishing.</p>

<p>The film begins, incongruously, with a Bible verse, written in a Gothic-tribal font, then cuts to a black screen with the sound of the ocean churning. A light flickers in the bottom corner of the image, and eventually, we find ourselves on board a massive fishing boat, all clinking chains, painted metal, and winches. During the first ten minutes, we witness, through a camera strapped to one of the workers, the process of bringing up a net that’s been trawling the ocean, and then releasing the mass of slippery silver and pink fish caught in the trap. This labor feels, well, laborious, and has only just begun &#8212; when the sequence ends, we notice that light just barely turned the sky from black to navy blue.</p>
<p>The excitement and movement of the opening sequence belies the repetition and drudgery of the work to come. In two later sequences, the camera lingers on the men cleaning the fish, gutting and beheading them with an efficiency that comes from experience. To those unaccustomed to slaughter, the scene is almost enough to turn one to vegetarianism. As the men work, the camera pans down the side of the wooden bin where the newly caught fish are kept, awaiting their fate, to find it caked and dripping with gore. A group of skates are equally doomed; as a fisherman unceremoniously lifts one with meat hooks, another hacks off its wing-like fins and tosses them into a bin. The waste of the fish – heads, guts, and fins – is dumped back into the sea. With the camera sitting on the ship’s steel floor, a fish’s head sits upside down; its bulbous eye stares back at us, as if prompting a response. Then, we cut to another camera half-submerged in the sea, sometimes underwater, other times emerging into the air, as fish viscera slides out the side of the ship in a red sludge. If ever one needed a visual illustration of the term “biomass,” <em>Leviathan</em> offers it.</p>

<p>Matching the unsentimental vision of the labor needed to help feed a population eager for seafood, who in turn are shielded from the violence involved in securing those meals, is a vision of the sea as vast and all-encompassing. Shots where the camera is plunged into the water offer little but darkness and the muffled reverberations of the ship, interrupted only by the white streaks of the wake and the occasional offal. The film’s soundtrack of crashing waves, winches and chains, and the deep rumble of the engines takes on an ominous musical quality in these scenes; so much so that I imagined incidental music emerging just under hearing.</p>
<p>Whereas the scenes of labor lull you with a sense of repetition, the “underwater” sequences transform the sea into an aesthetic, where you glimpse only the occasional recognizable object &#8212; a chain, a fish, seagulls when the lens breaks the surface. <em>Leviathan</em> is one part <em>Jeanne Dielman</em> (1975), and one part <em>Dog Star Man</em> (1961-1964), though even together those films are not quite the right comparison. There is something more real, and more accidental, about <em>Leviathan</em>, something to do with the primal in the midst of the industrial. One of the last shots of the film shows one of the fisherman seated in the ship’s kitchen; the garbage from his finished meal litters the table and he looks towards us but slightly off-screen. It sounds like he’s watching <em>Deadliest Catch</em>, and what we can hear &#8212; dramatic music, narration, editing &#8212; differs so greatly from the experience we’ve just had. As the show continues, the fisherman slowly closes his eyes, obviously exhausted from his work, and the television cuts to a commercial for a colon cleanser &#8212; two final reminders of biological reality in this strange approximation of home, deep in the bowels of the floating factory. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Roger Ebert was the first film critic I read seriously. For years as a teenager I awaited his reviews every Friday, and his was the first collection of film criticism I ever bought. He taught me that one could disagree with accepted wisdom about a film, and reach one’s own conclusion about it; moreover, he taught me how to defend that opinion. I remember disliking David Lynch’s <em>Blue Velvet</em> (1986) because of Ebert’s review, and after seeing it years later and revising my opinion, his influence remained, because now the lesson had stuck &#8212; my conclusion was my own. Although I read him less in recent years, he appeared still as a model of someone who believed in both cinema and humanity. Although it is sometimes difficult to retain a trust in either, this is another of Ebert’s lessons worth remembering.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Cancer crab July baby born in the deserts of New Mexico, I tend to love the summer. Breezy nautical styles, scoops of ice cream teetering on a sugar cone, sunshine that feels like it&#8217;s baking your body through and through, lazy naps on hot beaches, mmmmmhmm. This year, however, I’ve been itching for fall, even dreaming of it, yearning for it. Summer’s been too hot, too muggy. Where summer can harbor that feeling of freedom, of days off and little jaunts around every corner, this past one has felt too free &#8212; unfettered, unsure. When you’re a perpetual student like I am, fall (even as it’s marked by longer colder nights and withering life) can feel shiny, new, comforting. With fall’s back-to-school rhythm practiced into our bones, even the non-student, I imagine, feels that nostalgic rush as the leaves begin to turn and kids, kinder to college, busy about ruddy-cheeked in un-broken-in shoes. So, though it was just 94 degrees on a September day in Michigan, fall is on the way and it needs to be done right. This is my fall checklist:</p>
<p><strong>1. Imbibe pumpkin spiced (coffee) beverages</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10500" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/pumpkincoffee/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg" data-orig-size="305,363" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="pumpkincoffee" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=252" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=305" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=640" alt="pumpkin coffee" title="pumpkincoffee"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10500" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg 305w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=126 126w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/pumpkincoffee.jpeg?w=252 252w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /></p>
<p>Personally, I like to indulge in a Starbucks pumpkin spice frappuccino to welcome the fall. The seasonal lifespan of the product makes it exciting when it returns. When you see it there beckoning from the menu board you don’t think, “oh where, oh where, has my summer sun gone?,” you think, “YES, PUMPKINS!” Now, whether you get this particular drink, a hot coffee version, or a pumpkin pie smoothie (yes, those exist at some smoothie shops and they are delicious), you have to time this appropriately. Don’t get over-eager and take in liquid autumn on a day where you can still see those wavy heat lines emanating from your sweaty steaming face. Wait for a sunny day, one where the light isn’t so yellow, in fact it’s just a shade deeper, moving toward amber. Let the wind be just that flavor of breeze that tickles your arm hairs straight up, the one that chills you just enough that you start wondering how all your cardigans are doing. Extra whipped cream is okay, if not strictly required. </p>
<p><strong>2. Purchase and use school supplies</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10501" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/64specimens_1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg" data-orig-size="350,233" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK DX6340 ZOOM DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1155744266&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.5999999046326&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333335071802&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="64specimens_1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=350" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=640" alt="supplies" title="64specimens_1"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10501" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg 350w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/64specimens_1.jpeg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /></p>
<p>Since I was a little kid, the school supplies aisle has always been my favorite section of the store. Pencils and pens, pink rubber erasers, crayons and thick tablets of paper all packed and sorted, packaged with the glittery promise of use. Oh, actual glitter is there, too! Do you take your Elmer’s glue in original form, gel, stick, or paste? Not a fan of mucilage or spiral bound notebooks? Though that is incredibly hard to imagine, I suggest you at least drop a few dollars on an inky pen &#8212; there’s nothing like writing with a pen that glides along while it scratches lightly on the page. It makes you feel important and suddenly verbose, busy, and like you’re really leaving your mark on the world. If you have the heart of a dreamer, purchase that tell-tale mustard box of crayons. Pop the top and inhale their waxy scent. Draw precise lines and figures with the perfect pretty tip, or bear down hard in vibrant color. I promise the feeling will taste like fall.</p>
<p><strong>3. Buy a new hoodie or pull out an old favorite</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10502" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/hoodie/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hoodie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=640" alt="hoodie" title="hoodie"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10502" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hoodie.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Something about being an 80s kid and having E.T. etched into your memory makes popping on a sweet soft hoodie feel at once cozy comfortable and like you’re ready for any autumn adventure. Wear this one layer over your clothes on those evenings where bare arms and sundresses begin to fade into memory and you’ll feel instantly protected. Lift the hood to slip into your solitude. Pull the sleeves down over your knuckles; hold the fabric there with your thumbs. Feel the nubby fleece against your skin. Stow some Reese’s Pieces in your pocket. If Bob Ross’ gentle cooing could be formed into a piece of clothing, this it how it would feel against your skin.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be outside</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10503" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/05/a-back-to-school-list-for-the-rest-of-us/autumnleaf/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/autumnleaf.jpeg" data-orig-size="507,337" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Getty Images\/First Light&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Maple Leaf and Forest Canopy, Gatineau Park, Quebec.&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;56619358&quot;}" data-image-title="autumnleaf" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Maple Leaf and Forest Canopy, Gatineau Park, Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>You aren’t doing fall right if you aren’t out there walking around in it. For me, fall is incredibly contemplative. The colors of the trees are beautiful and they are both high above your head and cushioning your feet. There’s something incredibly insulating about this. Though autumn doesn’t quite offer the pregnant chrysalis-like pause of spring, it does bring a quieter, more melancholic awakening. To do fall right you have to mourn a little, respect the change, notice how lovely it is. Hold a veiny speckled leaf in your fingers. Crack a twig in half. Poke your finger in the dirt.

<p>When you’re not outside, you must curl up on a chair or couch, under a quilt, perhaps with the windows cracked a smidge for what could be the last time this year. Pets snoring or purring at your feet, read a book or watch a movie. This fall, I think <em>Grey Gardens</em> is where I’ll go. The documentary’s distressed browns and not-quite-cheery marigolds mimic the palette and emotional tone of the season. As we all become a little more reclusive in the changing weather, perhaps we can settle in to the devastatingly beautiful fall of a family, their land, and their home. Mother and daughter, both named Edith Beale, reflect on a gilded past and the future that never came while their home and any healthy relations to the outside world begin to crumble. It’s easy to see the gold-tinged beauty of Jackie O. and her Camelot, but I prefer to sit with her cousins, Big and Little Edie, out on their rotting deck &#8212; especially in this, the season of exquisite decay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love newspapers. When I was a kid we got two on weekdays &#8212; the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> and the <em>Lansing State Journal</em> &#8212; and every morning I started off with the comics (the <em>Free Press</em> was way better in this regard, and many others, than the <em>Journal</em>). On Sundays, once they finally began delivering to poor, benighted East Lansing, we got the <em>New York Times</em>. It was such a big, glorious paper! And, especially because my parents were displaced New Yorkers, it was a tantalizing glimpse of New York culture they’d left behind. It’s no surprise, then, that when I moved to Philadelphia for college, I nearly immediately subscribed to the <em>New York Times</em>. There was a college discount that made it affordable, and I was living the sort of student life where I could devour the whole lot of it every day. And it wasn’t that weird, skimpy national edition. We got the full glories of the New York edition. I’m still the sort of person who gets two newspapers &#8212; two print newspapers, that is. The <em>Washington Post</em> is my local weekday paper, the <em>Times</em> is still my Sunday joy. I probably encounter the papers equally online as opposed to in print, but I love the experience of reading the print paper. I love getting it online, too; it’s two different ways of reading that answer different needs.</p>
<p>Having said all that, <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Page_One_Inside_the_New_York_Times/70169900" target="_blank">Page One: Inside the New York Times</a></em> (2011) should be the movie for me. It’s a documentary about the <em>Times</em>, filmed in 2009 and 2010, when the paper and the news industry as a whole was in the midst of struggling with economic upheavals of the growth of the internet both as a competing source of news and as an advertising engine that was taking away revenue. Director Andrew Rossi focuses on the Media Desk, following editor Bruce Headlam into meetings where he pitches stories for Page One and reporters as they track down stories about WikiLeaks and the demise of the <em>Tribune</em>. But I didn’t love the movie. It took too long to find its focus, and the initial conversations about the relationships between print news and new media felt under thought and too lopsided. But the movie picks up steam when it starts spending more time with reporter David Carr, who is fascinating both for the glimpses we get of his life story (former crack addict, single dad on welfare) and for his irascible love for the <em>Times</em> and righteous indignation about the value of newspapers. Brian Stelter is the counterweight to Carr: new media transfer to legacy news, Stelter was still an undergrad at Towson University when he caught the eyes of the industry with his blog TVNewser and he’s now still a young ’un, albeit one who works for the biggest newspaper in town. The intellectual arguments about the future of the newspaper industry are fascinating, but this is a movie best approached as about how these individual reporters are navigating it.</p>
<p>If you can’t get enough of the <em>New York Times</em>, you might also want to watch <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bill_Cunningham_New_York/70141814" target="_blank">Bill Cunningham New York</a></em> (2010), a documentary about the 80-year-old bike-riding fashion photographer who loves street fashion as much as (or even more than) high fashion. Cunningham is just wonderful, and while the film is primarily about him, you get glimpses inside the <em>Times</em> newsroom as he and his editor work through the layout of his pieces. If you’re not interested in clothes, you’ll still like the movie: it’s full of information about publishing and life at Carnegie Hall and keeping the world at arm’s length.</p>
<p>And if you need some fictional newspaper stories to get your proper fix, <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Absence_of_Malice/214064" target="_blank">Absence of Malice</a></em> (1981)  is finally back on Netflix Instant. You all already know <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/">how I feel about Paul Newman</a> and he’s in fine form here. But you also get a searching look at the ethics of reporting as well as lots of newspaper technology porn, with lots of shots of presses in action and typing on computers and hidden microphones. If you want to get a feel for the changing technologies of reporting, this is the perfect companion to <em>Page One</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Friday, while waiting for one of my kid’s PBS programs to begin I saw a commercial for that evening’s <em>American Masters</em> program. I was surprised to find that the ad was for Cameron Crowe’s documentary about <em>Pearl Jam Twenty</em>. I set the DVR with plans to watch the show either in real time or later during the weekend. I was more curious than excited. I was a big Pearl Jam fan when I was a senior in high school, until maybe 1995. The last time I’d chosen to listen to the band I found the music dated and stale, a snapshot of the time. So while I remained curious about the program I didn’t hold out too much hope. I wanted to watch it to watch it, but I felt no emotional investment in the program. I ended up watching the <em>Pearl Jam Twenty</em> that next day.  It was impressive, and it revitalized what I thought about the band.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GzI8OhR0IVY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>This is the band that I just was so very enthralled with back when I was 17/18 years old. I can’t remember when I first heard the band; I can’t remember when I first bought <em>Ten</em>. I remember listening to my stereo one morning before I went to school and something about &#8220;Even Flow,&#8221; something about that song, just captured my ears. I listened again and again to the song and eventually the whole LP. I just loved it. And I can’t explain why. It may be a combination of the sound of the voice and the sound of the music but I was just hooked. I sought out and bought the various singles with all the extra songs sprinkled on the discs.</p>
<p>My strongest lingering Pearl Jam-related memory is the lead up to and the release of their second CD, <em>Vs.</em> Wherehouse Records offered the punters the chance to pre-order the CD. It was a relatively novel concept then, pre-ordering something on hand in a brick and mortal store. I remember the price, $9.88 per disc. You bought a ticket, a physical ticket, that your receipt was stapled to which you returned to the store upon the release of the disc. I ordered two, one for me and one for my brother. And the night the disc was released I headed downtown, parked at the Bailey Community Center, and walked down to Grand River. I found myself standing at the far stairwell (bear with me if you don’t know the geography of the building) nearest to the wacky head shop. I was at the bottom of the stairs, the line stopped there. It was maybe 10 o’clock? Maybe earlier. I looked in my pocket, I was out of smokes. I looked down Grand River, maybe I could walk to the Rite Aid and spend the two bucks for a pack. (Yes, I said two bucks.) I decided to stay and wait. Good thing, as the line stretched all the way down block, past the Rite Aid, all the way down to the Taco Bell on the corner. Soon the line began to move, and I reached the door, gave the two tickets to the person at the door and got two copies of the CD. Then I left, high tailed it to the car, opened the disc and put it in the SIX DISC CHANGER in the trunk of my car. I headed home, listening to the songs on the way. It sounded great.</p>
<p>I remember that I was working in a record store at the time <em>Vitology</em> was released and I remember anticipating it. However during the short time between releases I had bought a double disc bootleg of the band in Atlanta. Contained on the two disc, 55 dollar set were many songs that were to feature on that new release. When I did finally hear the finished product over half the tunes were familiar to me. This took something away from the disc. Over the next several months of 1994 and into 1995 something happened; my ears grew surrounded by all the new music contained for sale within Wherehouse’s walls and my own ears began to drift towards news sounds, sounds from England.</p>
<p>Pearl Jam’s 1996 release, <em>No Code</em>, was something that I bought when it was released, on CD and LP, but as I listened I found it boring. Very, very boring. To this day I own the first three Pearl Jam releases and nothing more. When their inaugural bootleg series came out I bought a few, but sold them. Again, too boring, and what’s more, too dated to listen to and enjoy. My ears had closed on the band. I didn’t shed a tear.</p>
<p>In the end it is the human side of the band that maks the film. Having been such a big fan I would watch the MTV News breaks all the time when the band were popular, I would read all about them in the magazines, I craved information on the band and as the grew bigger and quieter the news was harder to find. <em>Rolling Stone</em> even ran, in the absence of cooperation, an article about the unknown side of Eddie Vedder, which really was a lame way to get him on the cover of the magazine and sell a few issues.  To see these guys on the screen laughing and reflecting was so satisfying to finally see. And Chris Cornell, let me just add, is one charismatic dude. I’d watch a similar Soundgarden doc just to see more Cornell stories. Some of this comfort comes from Cameron Crowe, whose familiarity with the subjects I’m sure created a sense of ease that made the interview segments much smoother and more professional. We forget that Crowe started his career as a journalist (he wrote the authorized Pearl Jam cover story in 1993) and those skills from so long ago I’m sure informed his ability to get the band to open up. And his ability as a filmmaker informed the documentary as well. I am sure that his vision helped to create the enjoyable film experience. Crowe is the narrator; he does appear on screen to talk about his film <em>Singles</em>, but when it comes to his talking with the band you see his back or his side. At one point he steps out from behind the camera to tour Stone Gossard’s house in search of memorabilia only to find one coffee mug and a Grammy in the basement. Crowe’s role seems more of a confidant meant to facilitate the dialogue of the film and that helps, as the band’s reticence is still evident, even with a friendly face.</p>
<p>Watching <em>PJ20</em> did ramp up my enthusiasm for the band and so I ventured over to the wall and pulled down <em>Ten</em> and <em>Vs.</em> I can’t remember the last time I listened to the discs, but the last time I did they had not aged well. I started with <em>Ten</em> (my Japanese edition with the bonus track cover of &#8220;I’ve Got A Feeling&#8221;), popped it into the car and listened. First thoughts were that I remembered all the words, even after all this time. Second thoughts were how WORDY the songs were. Man alive, it felt like there was not a syllable that wasn’t squashed into those songs. And then those lyrics, while confessional, just felt wordy and boring and sort of, I dunno, dated. It just sort of was there. I remember the feelings and rushes of euphoria I felt listening to those songs at 17/18 years old but that feeling was long gone. The lyrics were confessional and frankly, not very interesting. I moved on to <em>Vs.</em>, a disc I waited and waited or. I put it in and checked it out. Same complaints as with <em>Ten</em>, really. The song &#8220;Animal,&#8221; a personal favorite of mine from the time I watched the band perform the song at the 1993 Video Music Awards, remains a strong song for my enjoyment. It is short, has impact, and doesn’t feel like a victim of the lyrical wordiness I now find in so many of the band’s songs. &#8220;Daughter&#8221; and &#8220;Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town&#8221; remain fine songs, catchy and warm and impartial. So many of these early songs are about turmoil and conflict and expressing those feelings feel like a young man’s game and hearing those words now it feel all the more apt. Even the songs about “big issues” feel stale and false now. The allusions to gun control in &#8220;Glorified G,&#8221; the Malice Green inspired &#8220;W.M.A.,&#8221; the anti-journalistic screed &#8220;Blood.&#8221; Good God, who cares you know? The disc just felt so much less than I remember. I listened to &#8220;Vitalogy&#8221; again and that too fell victim to the same issues as the first two discs. Wordy and vapid, but it held up better than the first two. Maybe it was due to my ears getting distracted in 1994 by new sounds, maybe that is why I didn’t listen to the disc as much. With less time spent listening my memories are different and somehow purer. The songs sound better and that helps.<br />
I know that as we age and grow our ears change and what we lived and liked at one point doesn’t hold up. Pearl Jam feels that way to me.</p>
<p>Am I glad I was such a big fan? Sure. Am I bothered by not being one now? No.  If anything now I am glad to have enjoyed their music and glad to able to see the band as adults, working adults, laughing and having had fun. That humanizing of Pearl Jam makes me enjoy my time devoted to their band all the more as behind the differing ways I viewed the band at their core they are human, just like all of us, and they seem to have found peace and that makes me happy. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a teenage movie-watcher, I was the first to jump on the new-genre bandwagon whenever anyone tried something different that played with, bent or overlapped conventional film structure. Somewhere between those teenage years of wonder when everything was fascinating, and, like, 2008, I got burned by experimental filmmaking. Not enough to make me ever avoid the indie films I always had and always will gravitate toward, but enough to make me go into them slightly wary and, perhaps, not expecting to be bowled-over like I expected to be when I was fifteen, and admittedly more bowl-over-able.</p>

The directing duo’s previous works included <em>The Celluloid Closet</em> (1996) and Epstein’s <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em> (1984), documentaries which I already loved, but these were traditional docs, without actors in the roles. And even if they weren’t (like Gus Van Sant’s <em>Milk</em> (2008), which I also adored), dramatizing the lives of creative people&mdash;writers, artists, musicians&mdash;creates different challenges than dramatizing the lives of historical or other figures. The nature of the entertainment careers of creative people provide archiving that is more thoroughly ingested by the public, and that asserts itself as a strong, recognizable precedent in the artist’s look, voice, demeanor and <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. Ours is an entertainment-driven culture more than a historically-driven one, partly because of the deep personal fulfillment people glean from the arts. This strong attachment sometimes results in beloved creators being viewed as sort of enigmatic beings, a highly non-specific and interpretive construct for an actor to try to replicate. Playing an artist is in no way harder than playing any other type of historical figure, but I believe that actors in non-artist biographical roles are more easily accepted by the audience overall, whereas when actors play artists, there are more opportunities to misstep in the eye of the film consumer and their preconceived idea of how their favorite musician or writer should be represented on screen. So while I went into Van Sant’s <em>Milk</em> already knowing I would love it, I was excited to see <em>Howl</em>, but didn’t know what to expect.</p>

And in trying to figure out why this &#8220;hybrid&#8221; film approach succeeded in the case of <em>Howl</em> when it had fallen short in some other instances of unconventional film genre, I’ve come away with this: the main reason <em>Howl</em> was so good, apart from the obvious fantastic direction, acting (by Franco as well as the supporting cast) and production, is because every aspect of the film&mdash;from the biggest to the most subtle&mdash;was done exclusively to serve Ginsberg, the time period and the trial in the most authentic way possible.</p>
<p>It’s a little unfair to compare this aspect of Epstein’s and Friedman’s directing to a traditional director, because obviously filmmakers with a background in documentary film are better-equipped to handle the recreation of history. And in general, American films are notoriously bad at representing time periods (“A film in the 20s? Okay, we need. . . red lipstick, and. . . a bob haircut. And one of those huge radios that looks like a sideboard. Voila! We’re done!”) But the thing I loved most about <em>Howl</em> is that the focus was entirely on Ginsberg himself and the events. Even style of the animated sequences were designed by the marvelous <a target="new" href="http://www.drooker.com/">Eric Drooker</a>, an artist who collaborated directly with Ginsberg late in the poet’s life.</p>

Oftentimes this type of creative license is applauded for injecting a new twist into an already-known artist. That is certainly valid, and absolutely any director brings their own interpretation to a subject in a piece.</p>
<p>However, the problem with getting too interpretive with biopics is the potential for the personal ownership the director feels for the subject to circumvent their desire to serve the creative person themself. Too much personal interpretation by a director in a biographical film can do a disservice to the audience by encapsulating the subject in the director’s own experience. This is meaningful to the director, but it creates a static vacuum where the audience is tunneled into the director’s own feelings toward the subject and potentially out of their own. It can come off as self-indulgent to assume that your personal interpretation of a well-known creative figure is more relevant than what you would allow the audience to take away from the film if you do it to only serve the person whom the film is about, like the directors did with <em>Howl</em>.</p>
<p>I know sometimes, the director doesn’t have a choice. For instance, in the production of <em>I’m Not There</em> (2007), Todd Haynes was in a double-bind because there was no way Bob Dylan would ever, ever allow anyone to do a straight biopic of his life. The reason <em>I’m Not There</em> was made at all was because it was a highly abstracted film-idea based interpretively around Dylan’s life, songwriting and ideas of himself. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed <em>I’m Not There</em> (and who didn’t love seeing Cate Blanchett’s Dylan?), but I’m curious whether the narrative would be easy to follow if you weren’t already a hardcore Dylan fan with a lot of previous knowledge of the musician or hadn&#8217;t already watched Martin Scorsese’s 4-hour Bob Dylan documentary epic, <em>No Direction Home</em> (2005).</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3228" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3228" data-attachment-id="3228" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/26/howling-for-authentic-biographical-cinema-why-the-new-ginsberg-film-succeeds/the-real-ginsberg/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-real-ginsberg.jpg" data-orig-size="449,317" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="the-real-ginsberg" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-real-ginsberg.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-real-ginsberg.jpg?w=449" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-real-ginsberg.jpg?w=300&#038;h=211" alt="Allen Ginsberg" title="the-real-ginsberg" width="300" height="211" class="size-medium wp-image-3228" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-real-ginsberg.jpg?w=300&amp;h=211 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-real-ginsberg.jpg?w=150&amp;h=106 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/the-real-ginsberg.jpg 449w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3228" class="wp-caption-text">Allen Ginsberg</p></div> In a bio film, events are punched up or altered slightly to maintain a cohesive story. This is a given. But when events are sensationalized or the tone of the people or history is changed in an effort to modernize it for contemporary audiences, or &#8220;sell&#8221; it to the audience in some way, the result is less genuine. This is something that is no doubt done out of box-office fear, trying to make a movie that will appeal to a perceived wider audience, or to ensure the draw of a more mainstream clientele outside of people who are already fans of the individual. This has huge potential to disappoint fans who really are interested in the film subject, or, in the case of the Edie Sedgwick biopoic <em>Factory Girl</em> (2006), potentially piss off people who knew the subject or were represented in the film; <a target="new" href="http://stereogum.com/4161/factory_girl_defaming_dylan/news/">i.e., Bob Dylan and Lou Reed</a> (for the record though, I’m still a fan of <em>Factory Girl</em> for other reasons).</p>
<p>History is history, and interpretive social context changes over time. For this reason, biographical films like <em>Milk</em> and <em>Howl</em> that try to present factual portraits of their subjects have the potential to remain the most powerful, watchable and memorable over time; because you remember the subject themself, not how they may have been reconfigured by, or impacted the creative life of, the director. </p>

He’s the kind of man you want to protect and take care of, but also get busy with at the same time. As creepy of an assessment as that may sound on my part, I felt oddly exonerated when I heard most everyone who was close to Cazale say basically the same thing&mdash;albeit more tactfully&mdash;in the first documentary ever about the actor, <em>I Knew It Was You: Rediscovering John Cazale</em> (2009) by director Richard Shepard. </p>
<p>It’s an apt title. Although Cazale never became a household name, even non-cinema-buffs will still recognize him from his role as Fredo Corleone, the infamously betraying brother to Al Pacino’s Michael in the <em>Godfather</em> films. Cazale only appeared in five movies before his life was painfully cut short, and as the documentary points out, all of them received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture. But even though a heartfelt interview in <em>I Knew It Was You</em> reveals Al Pacino himself saying, “I think I learned more about acting from John than [from] anybody,” Cazale never received an Oscar nomination. </p>
<blockquote><p>John Cazale elevated the people around him. He knew that part of his job was not only to play his own characters with integrity, but to play them in such a way that made the other characters credible.</p>
<p>—Mark Harris (film historian)</p></blockquote>

When you watch him in a role you don’t think, &#8220;There’s a despicable worm,&#8221; or, &#8220;There’s a disposable villain,&#8221; you feel awash with a myriad of conflicting emotions that range from aversion to tenderness. It’s strange to empathize with characters who have a seemingly complete lack of principle, and yet when Cazale plays them, you do. They exist alongside the strong characters who make all the right choices&mdash;or at least all the successful ones&mdash;but for these amorphous men, integrity is not only not enough of a driving force, it is a moot one. They are so mired in insecurity, failure and shame that it’s not that the challenge of making the right decision is too daunting, it is so utterly beyond the scope of the characters’ developmental capabilities as to be irrelevant. The doomed characters in any piece are often some of the most fascinating. The world is a harder place for them, and they are pushed to choose wrong; slated to fail from the start. They aren’t weak because they choose to be, they’re weak because that’s truly the best they can do. And yet, Cazale makes them fully-realized people. He makes them vulnerable.</p>
<p>Vulnerable. Shepard’s documentary contains a wealth of interviews with others about the actor’s personal and professional life, and &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; was the magic word used to describe Cazale’s acting by nearly everyone who knew or knew of him. It was undoubtedly one of the many things that made him so appealing to women, including Meryl Streep (yes, Meryl Streep), who was Cazale’s devoted fiancee at the time of his 1978 death from lung cancer. There’s a great respect and reverence surrounding the actor when he’s spoken about by colleagues and friends, even as they affectionately recount peculiarities that sound suspiciously like obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>

She was only 27 when Cazale died (he was 42), and he had already been diagnosed with lung cancer before he appeared in <em>The Deer Hunter</em> (1978), in which Streep also appeared. Director Michael Cimino was opposed to casting Cazale because his illness made him &#8220;un-insurable,&#8221; which roughly translates to, &#8220;If he dies before the movie is finished, it will cost too much to reshoot every scene he was in with a new actor.&#8221; In the end, it was colleague and friend Robert De Niro who ensured John could appear in what would be the last film of his life.</p>
<p>“Bob De Niro went to bat for John,” Streep said. “He won’t tell me because he’s a very generous person, but I think he secured the bond on John’s participation.”</p>
<p>“He was sicker than we thought, but I wanted him to be in it,” Robert De Niro said.</p>
<p>With a rearranged shooting schedule, Cazale completed all his scenes and gave an unparalleled performance that was in no way marred by his illness.</p>
<p>He died before <em>The Deer Hunter</em> was released.</p>
<p><em>I Knew It Was You</em> is a lovely appreciation by Richard Shepard of an underappreciated actor, with some never-before-seen dvd extras that contain a couple black-and-white film shorts Cazale shot and appeared in in the 60s. It’s also a great holiday gift idea for fans of <em>The Godfather</em>, film documentary or 70s cinema. Or if there’s someone like me on your list who loves to see unconventional men finally get the accolades they deserve.</p>
<blockquote><p>His compassion for [the] people he was portraying, and the sort-of responsibility he felt to a fictional character as if it were a real soul—that made him go that deep into his characters and do beautiful, beautiful work.</p>
<p>—Meryl Streep </p></blockquote>
