										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always firmly believed that, deep down, people like to be corrected when they are so wrong about something that it borders on embarrassment. Mind you, I say “people,” and not “friends,” for reasons that should be immediately self-evident. However, as one of the newest contributors to <em>The Idler</em>, I feel I have a responsibility to inform my colleagues that they are all unquestionably, irredeemably and thoroughly incorrect in the running debate about just who is the best Doctor.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">Matt Smith</a> is a very fine Doctor, better than I had expected in fact. <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Christopher Eccleston</a>, <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/04/kindness-and-fury/">David Tennant</a>, fantastic both. But the one that stands head and shoulders (and quite a mop of hair) above the other Doctors is none of these, or for that matter, any Who had come before. The best Doctor, running across our television screens on a mission through time and space, is, in fact, Dr. Mrs. The Doctor: the often mysterious, ever sharp-witted, frequently dangerous, and classically stunning River Song, played by actress Alex Kingston.</p>

<p>Point of clarification: I’m a relatively new recruit to <em>Doctor Who</em> fandom. My husband’s giggling like a child over every Dalek appearance has generally fallen on deaf ears (I wish!) for years. I have been in the room for more episodes than I can claim to have watched, ever finding a comic book to read, web to surf or cookbook to page through while some madman slides across the TV screen with a vibrating piece of hardware that I barely know how to use in non-vibrating form. But all that disinterest evaporated the moment River Song walked into the library and bid hello to her sweetie for the first (and last) time.</p>
<p>I can’t say precisely what it was that made me toss <em>Bridge for Dummies</em> aside and take notice those first moments, but I have a pretty good idea. Here was a confident, beautiful woman who clearly knew more about the Doctor than the Doctor knew about her. That alone placed her far above in my mind any traditional companion, each of whom is clearly present firstly for the purpose of exposition and viewer projection. And then it was revealed: River Song is no run-of-the-mill companion. She knew the Doctor’s name. THE DOCTOR’S NAME. You don’t come across that information by chance. No, this lady was important. She’d been through many adventures with the Doctor (most of which we’ve presumably already seen now &#8212; drat) and beamed happily that they were all ahead of him at this point in his timeline. And then she died. Good Lord. I was hooked.</p>

<p>Two people living their lives in reverse, never traveling through time in the same order, is so beautifully romantic it should be a movie (or at least an acclaimed novel). So, yes, we’ve seen this trope before in both iterations of <em>The Time Traveler’s Wife</em>, but never with so much agency for that titled character. Dr. Song (as in life, I must acknowledge the title, for it is not easily acquired) doesn’t just sit around waiting for the next time her bow-tied beau will show up to whisk her away. Sure, she may need a quick rescue from time-to-time, but carving coordinates into the side of an ancient mountain with her trademark salutation “Hello, Sweetie!” isn’t exactly fainting at a villain’s moustache twirl. She’s ballsy enough to shoot herself out an airlock with no oxygen and trusts that the Doctor will have gotten her directions. The greater trust, I’d argue, isn’t in the Doctor, though. It’s in her own ingenuity and ability to know exactly what levers to pull in the Doctor’s personality and history to get the maximum desired results.</p>
<p>And that’s nothing compared to the gun-slinging. This scene from the Sixth Series’ &#8220;Day of the Moon&#8221; encapsulates everything about why Dr. Song is close to my heart. She flirts from a position of intellectual strength (and gets the often timid Doctor to flirt along with equal glee) and she polishes off a room of enemies like a 50-year veteran of Laser Tag University.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVVQ0u--mYo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>So, yeah, River Song is brilliant, but why is she a better Doctor than the Doctor?</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>She’s redeemed.</strong> My understanding of the Doctor is that he’s always been a do-gooder. Traveling through time, righting wrongs, helping civilizations evolve &#8212; that’s the Doctor’s schtick. Dr. Song’s past is not that cut-and-dried. I’d rather not get into the minutia of River’s origins in case you, dear reader, are one of the lucky few to not yet have enjoyed them firsthand, but let’s just say they’re murky. She’s in prison for murdering “The best man I’ve ever known” (now who could that be?) but she clearly cares about saving lives and defending the innocent. She’s compassionate and good with all kinds of reasons to not have become either one.</li>
<li><strong>She’s smarter.</strong> Dr. Song almost immediately exhibits more ingenuity in how to do the things the Doctor does, from uses for the sonic screwdriver to how to appropriately pilot the TARDIS. Yes, one could say she has the advantage of hindsight from her point in the Doctor’s history, but let’s be honest about that. The Doctor has lived, at any given point of the current narrative, around one thousand years. You’d think he’d know to take the brakes off when landing by now. That noise doesn’t sound good to me, and I can barely pump my own gasoline.</li>
<li><strong>She’s got more to lose. </strong>Dr. Song can’t regenerate (you’ll see) and doesn’t live forever. She’s human, but still has to emotionally deal with the loss and pain that comes along with being a time-traveler. She’ll have to say goodbye to the people she loves just like the Doctor, and frankly, it seems to me she loves them just a little bit more. Despite all that, she jumps into adventure like every day is her last. No matter what the Doctor claims, he’s pretty sure he’ll be around tomorrow. Ultimately, River knows, someday she won’t. Life doesn’t end well for River, but she puts it all on the line anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dr. Song knows what her worst day is, and it isn’t the day she dies. Neither me, as that was the day I first came across clever, ruthless, amazing River and fell in love with <em>Doctor Who</em>. No, her heartbreaking moment will be “when I&#8217;ll look into that man&#8217;s eyes &#8212; my Doctor &#8212; and he won&#8217;t have the faintest idea who I am.”  Mine is when <em>my</em> Doctor, Dr. Song, disappears forever, the last tale of a finite life told, and I have to go back to my reading material when the TARDIS buzzes in the background.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly fifty years and eleven actors, we have some idea of what makes the Doctor: <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">&#8220;He’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s a bit distant, and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">&#8220;he has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s dangerous &#8212; when the Doctor is around, people die &#8212; but he&#8217;s irresistible, and, in the David Tennant incarnation at least, he&#8217;s a walking broken heart. He&#8217;s the one who has to make all the impossible choices and save the world, even though he may not be able to save you.</p>
<p>After Christopher Eccleston spent a year breathing new life into the Doctor Who francise, and sacrificed himself to save pop singer Billie Piper (a.k.a. Rose Tyler) from a case of terminal omnipotence, David Tennant stepped into the Doctor&#8217;s trainers and travelling coat for a four-year, three-season run as the Tenth and best Doctor. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s run actually starts off a bit slowly, not entirely hitting its stride until halfway through #10&#8217;s second year (and second companion).</p>
<p>In &#8220;Human Nature/The Family of Blood,&#8221; the Doctor and companion Martha Jones hide out in early twentieth century England from a family of intergalactic hunters. In order to keep the family from tracking them, the Doctor has to alter his physiology to become human, and hide his memories and identity in a pocket watch. (It&#8217;s <em>Doctor Who</em>. Believe it or not, it all makes sense in the episode. Mostly.) The family is relentless, but they&#8217;re short-lived, so if the Doctor and Martha can hide for a few months, they&#8217;ll be safe.</p>
<p>While they&#8217;re hiding, however, the Doctor has no idea that he&#8217;s been anything other than John Smith, schoolteacher at a boys&#8217; boarding school. To make things worse, he&#8217;s fallen in love with the school nurse, Joan Redfern. In order to become the Doctor again, John Smith has to give up his existence. In effect, he has to die for the Doctor to live, and since the Family of Blood has found him, the Doctor has to live in order to be able to save the people John Smith loves.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4wziEiE3Vc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>It is, interestingly, a story in which the Doctor is almost entirely absent, even when David Tennant is onscreen, and when the Doctor returns, his return is terrible.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SC0NuBaliLs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>After this episode, David Tennant&#8217;s Doctor is constantly on the edge of not being the Doctor anymore. After defeating fellow Time Lord The Master (the brilliant, manic John Simm) in &#8220;The Last of the Time Lords,&#8221; the Doctor nearly gives up his itinerant existence in order to care for (and imprison) the one being who could actually be a full and equal companion. In &#8220;The Waters of Mars,&#8221; the Doctor abandons Time Lord constraints and attempts to intervene in a fixed point in history &#8212; avert a tragedy without which the human race might never have set out to explore the universe. In &#8220;Journey&#8217;s End,&#8221; the Doctor prevents a full regeneration (and the same sort of identity death that John Smith faced) by shunting his regeneration energy into the creation of a full second self, who isn&#8217;t a Time Lord, isn&#8217;t immortal, and, not coincidentally, end up getting to lead exactly the sort of life the Doctor wishes that he could have, sharing a single lifetime with an equal partner, instead of an eternal series of temporary companions.</p>
<p>Whatever he does, the Tenth Doctor is never able to escape the costs of his actions, and indeed, his very existence. He is always apologizing to the people he cannot save, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQkFNVhppXo" target="_blank">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In some sense, judging whether the Tenth Doctor is the best Doctor isn&#8217;t an entirely fair competition, since, rather unusually for a new Doctor, Tennant inherits a lot of the strongest elements of Eccleston&#8217;s (and Russell T. Davies&#8217;) modern <em>Doctor Who</em> relaunch. <em>Doctor Who</em> isn&#8217;t really known for continuity &#8212; in fact, each regeneration is normally treated as an entirely fresh start &#8212; but the Tenth Doctor benefits from the show&#8217;s willingness to reach back to previous companions and previous Doctors, and to continue to build on the relationships the Tenth Doctor creates. Companions depart and return &#8212; Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, and even Sarah Jane Smith, who traveled with the Third and Fourth Doctors. Every departure is heartbreaking. Every return comes at a cost, and leads both to triumph and further heartbreak.</p>
<p>For all that, in all honesty, I&#8217;m a bit surprised to not find myself fonder of Matt Smith&#8217;s Eleventh Doctor. The current head writer, Steven Moffat is responsible for many of the very best episodes of both the Ninth and Tenth Doctors&#8217; runs, including &#8220;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances,&#8221; the Christopher Eccleston episodes that finally made me a full-on rabid fan of the Doctor, and my absolute favorite episode, &#8220;Blink,&#8221; which really should totally devastate my argument since David Tennant is barely in it.</p>
<p>But the Eleventh Doctor&#8217;s episodes are somehow shallower. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s playfulness with language (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GMkWfpj4s" target="_blank">&#8220;Allons-y! I should say allons-y more often. Allons-y. Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!&#8221;</a>) is transformed into a penchant for silly hats. (I&#8217;ll give you the fez, Matt Smith, but the stetson/bow tie combination is not cool.) Even worse, Moffat somehow steps on his own best ideas. The Weeping Angels, so frightening and unique in &#8220;Blink,&#8221; (&#8220;The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death.&#8221;) are transformed into brutes that just snap your neck.</p>
<p>I will look forward to the new season, especially if it gives Matt Smith a chance to figure out who his Doctor is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/21/showbiz/tv/doctor-who-new-companion-ew/index.html" target="_blank">without Amy Pond</a>. No Doctor who hasn&#8217;t lost a companion is <em>really</em> the Doctor, and that, ultimately, is why the Tenth Doctor has to stand above Nine and Eleven.</p>

Fezzes are cool.</p></div> My esteemed college and, more importantly, fellow Sarah, has asserted <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor is the best Doctor</a>. While in every subjective way her opinion is well reasoned and valid, in every objective way her opinion is obviously ill-informed and invalid. Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor is the best of the modern Doctors. </p>
<p>My personal <em>Doctor Who</em> trajectory had me starting, like Sarah, with Nine and I&#8217;d also consider it blasphemy to skip him and go to Ten. But while I watched the modern series as it premiered, I also simultaneously watched some of the classic series thanks to the magic of Netflix. I&#8217;d jump from the grumpy First Doctor to the <em>joie de vivre</em> of the Ninth Doctor, then back to the flamboyant Fourth Doctor, then to the manic Tenth Doctor. The result being I never really imprinted on one particular Doctor or developed a certain expectation for the show. </p>
<p>For me, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether Eleven is the truest incarnation of earlier versions of The Doctor (he is) or whether he&#8217;s the most interesting portrayal of The Doctor (he is) or whether Matt Smith is just the most handsome of the three modern Doctors (oh, yes, he is). What matters is that Eleven is the most believable character. </p>
<p>All my problems with the Tenth Doctor and Russell T. Davies crystallized in the character&#8217;s finale where Ten has to decide whether to give his life for a human, an elderly man he had no particular connection to or affection for. Not the love of his life, not the president, not a child destined for greatness. Just a run-of-the-mill old guy who by his own admission will probably die in a couple years anyhow. </p>

<blockquote><p>Look at you, not remotely important. But me, I could do so much more!</p></blockquote>
<p>I hate most vampires because they&#8217;re unrealistic, and I don&#8217;t mean the blood sucking part. If you are a thousand-year-old nearly invincible creature, why are you spending your time and energy becoming super BFFs with humans? </p>
<p>I mean, I have a cat. I love my cat. I&#8217;m going to outlive it and be sad when it dies. I&#8217;ll probably get a new cat after that. But no matter how much I love my cat, I&#8217;m not going to give my life for it or pretend my cat or cats in general have any sort of meaningful impact on my life or the world. In what functional way are humans different than cats when it comes to other worldly immortal beings? </p>
<p>Now in the Doctor&#8217;s case, sure, he&#8217;s the last of his kind so he&#8217;s going to get bored and lonely and want to befriend other creatures. I get why Ten finds humanity interesting and wants to hang out with humans. What I don&#8217;t understand is why Ten gets all weepy and martyrs himself for one lousy human. You&#8217;d never see Eleven (or any other Doctor (or any other ancient, nearly invincible being)) giving his life in such a meaningless bargain. He cares more about puzzles than people. </p>
<p>Eleven doesn&#8217;t give a shit. He&#8217;ll promise a kid he&#8217;ll be right back then take another ten or fifteen years to get around to it. Does he care about what he put that kid through? Eh, not really. He has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely. Hanging out with humans is a means to an end: fun. </p>
<p>Taken in isolation as a character, Eleven is unequivocally my favorite but when you start looking at plot, companions, and how it&#8217;s written generally then things get murkier. </p>

Davies tugs at your heart with dramatic emotional plots, Stephen Moffat tugs at your brain with complex intellectual plots. Eleven’s aloofness pairs well with Moffat’s cerebral writing. </p>
<p>When it comes to companions, I don&#8217;t love any of them, and Amy least of all. Her lack of agency in the show is disturbing. (I was really pregnant and in a vat the whole time!) Unfortunately what I love about the character of Eleven, I hate about the writer: Stephen Moffat is extremely misogynistic. From <em>Coupling</em> to <em>Sherlock</em> to <em>Doctor Who</em>, all his leads are characterized by a borderline pathological disregard for women. I still enjoy his shows but it&#8217;s not always easy. </p>
<p>As a show with decades of history and hundreds of people working on it, the quality of the episodes vary wildly. It&#8217;s almost impossible to be a fan of the show and love all of it. Of my DWho friends, I&#8217;m probably the most critical of the show. From the cheesy to the nonsensical to the overblown, for every one episode I love there&#8217;s probably two I hate. But the highs are high and they keep me coming back for more. </p>
<p>Because when you start in on <em>Doctor Who</em> you have to watch it for better or worse, in cheesiness and in earnestness, as long as you both shall endure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I finally decided to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em>. I’m not sure why I hadn’t before. I think it always seemed too hardcore. Everyone I knew who watched the show was constantly making in-jokes with other Who fans. (One indication of how out of it I am: are fans of the show Who fans or Doctor fans?) This is in part because when I was growing up, and indeed up though most of my college years, the show was still on the air. And the folks I knew who watched it? They didn’t just watch the current seasons. No, they went back and watched all the seasons from its start in 1963. (Come to think of it, what did they do before VCRs became readily available? That scarcity might go a long way in explaining the fanaticism of my friends. You have to be hardcore to watch a show in its infancy when it’s not available on streaming, or DVD, or video. You’d have to bond with other people searching out the series instead of sticking with the more readily available <em>Dallas</em> or <em>M*A*S*H*</em>.) (It’s not that I wasn’t a science fiction fan—I have treasured memories of watching <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Star_Trek/70136140" target="_blank">Star Trek</a></em> with my mom, even though that series had stopped, so clearly syndication was available, even back in the dark days of my childhood. But somehow <em>Doctor Who</em> wasn’t part of our picture.)</p>
<p>If I can’t quite explain why I hadn’t watched it before, neither can I explain why I decided to start watching it last year. I suspect that somehow I stumbled across it streaming on Netflix, had nothing else to do, and thought, why not? It might have been after <em>Sherlock</em> was over and I was desperate for something British to watch. I’m not sure. But in any case, the show was baffling and inexplicable and I couldn’t stop watching.</p>

Yes, I laugh knowingly at Dalek jokes, but those are just funny. But a conversation on twitter recently made me realize that I might have my own obsessive corner after all. A tweep announced that he was going to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em> and asked for advice on where to begin—the most recent season? Or back to David Tennant? The consensus, much to my horror, was to begin with David Tennant, aka the Tenth Doctor, who took over the role in the final episode of the return of the series in 2005. I certainly don’t want to cast aspersions on Tennant’s Doctor &#8212; he seems a lovely fellow and all. But the right answer to this question is to start at the beginning of the revived series in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, aka the Best Doctor.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to start the series with the Best Doctor. And I’ll confess that I’m only halfway through the 3<sup>rd</sup> new series (aka the 2007 season), so perhaps Tennant will grow on me, or I’ll discover that Matt Smith, the Eleventh Doctor, is the best of them all. But I doubt it. I think Eccleston has imprinted on me and he’ll be what I always want the Doctor to be. Here’s what I love about him: he’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side (whoops, a bit of childhood <em>Star Wars</em> in there) and becoming too destructive. I suppose that seems like it might reveal more about me than about the show, but I’m not really that much into dangerous men. (Ok, given <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/" target="_blank">my previous attestations of love for Paul Newman</a>, that might not be entirely true, though I will stand by my position that his dangerous persona goes hand-in-hand with his real-life loving-husband, do-gooder one.)</p>
<p>What makes Eccleston work in ways that Tennant doesn’t is that he gives the Doctor an edge. Without that edge, it’s too easily just a series of romps through time with someone who is all-powerful and yet has a tragic history. With Eccleston’s manic danger (a trait that he brings to many of his roles, but that here is balanced with some joy and goodness), you get a sense that there’s something at stake in the Doctor’s adventures. Is he going to destroy the world or save it? There’s no fun in the hero always being the hero. It’s the tension between saving and failing that makes a story compelling. Maybe Tennant comes to that later on, but in his first seasons, he doesn’t hold a candle to Eccleston.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em>, currently streaming seasons 1 through 6 of the new series: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441" target="_blank">http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441</a></p>
<p>Some earlier episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> seem to be streaming on Netflix, too, but honestly, the search interface is such a nightmare that I can’t figure out what order the shows go in, so you’re on your own for finding those. Sorry. I recommend you search on <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/" target="_blank">the Instant Watch Database</a> to see what’s what. If <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/search/main?search=1&amp;searchPage=1&amp;previousTextSearch=&amp;previousSubGenre=0&amp;textSearch=Doctor%20Who&amp;textSearchType=all&amp;genre=0&amp;availability=&amp;rating=&amp;quality=&amp;startYear=1914&amp;endYear=2012&amp;Submit=Instant%20Watch%20Search!" target="_blank">this link</a> hasn’t degraded, it will take you to a nice page with the available episodes listed in order. Good luck!</p>

<p>For anyone unfamiliar with a Theremin it’s the wonderful machine that makes that cool flying saucer noise!  Used for the soundtracks of such classics as <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em>, <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Ed Wood</em>, and <em>Ghostbusters</em>, I can’t imagine why any film/television musical enthusiast wouldn’t want one.  I SURE AS HELL DO.  For an added Techie bonus, you can buy a kit and build your own!</td>

<p>Now that I’m all caught up on <em>Doctor Who</em> and re-obsessed with British television this is the perfect mug.  Though it is not bigger on the inside, the little lid of the TARDIS makes it awesome for tea steeping, if that’s your brewing style. This makes an awesome holiday gift especially if it’s received in time for use during the <em>Doctor Who Christmas Special</em>!</td>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had gorgeous weather in my new neighborhood this past weekend, though I hardly got to enjoy any of it on account of being knocked on my arse by my own traitorous sinuses. With sickness comes a lot of time spent languishing under warm blankets and snuggling into fluffy pillows while I wish away my sore throat and the onslaught of mucous hordes. Husband was out of town (he felt icky before I did and I forced him to take ALL the cold medicine with him since he’d need it more than me) and I had no one to keep me company except for our two cats and The Doctor.</p>
<p>Doctor Who?</p>
<p>Yes. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw" target="new">That’s the one.</a></p>
<p>Some friends of mine are dead mad over this British Sci Fi program <em>Doctor Who</em>. I had never really watched it, but they kept telling me I’d love it. I was all alone in a strange neighborhood in a strange state with no agenda to speak of and mix in the thickening agent of feeling ill AND homesick on top of it. With the help of Netflix I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>Turns out, there’s always something about a fast-talking, wickedly smart, funny English bloke I can’t help but adore (*waves girlishly at Simon Pegg*). The Doctor is an alien in human form and he is a Time Lord, the last of his kind. He travels through time and space in his blue Police Box called the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) with his (usually female) companions. He helps the races of the universe sort out their messes. He really just wants everybody and everything to get along, but woe to those beings set on conquest and destruction (I’m looking at you, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek" target="new">Daleks</a>, you jerk asses).</p>
<p>The episodes are fairly formulaic, but in that comforting way your childhood shows were: Episode begins normal (as normal as a show about space and time travel throughout the entire universe can) there’s some sort of mystery to be solved, problems arise, ensue and are overcome always in the nick of time (unless it’s a two parter).</p>
<p>I’ve found Doctor Who extremely medicinal while I’m ill and homesick (see what I’ve done there?). British TV series have always been my favorites since I was a child. I grew up watching things like <em>Fawlty Towers</em> and the BBC miniseries of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>. Douglas Adams’ glorious tales of space travel, wacky characters and alien life forms always held my attention. Through <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide</em>, and those two weeks I spent every February battling strep throat, I developed television-viewing stamina and have since become a damn champion of TV series consumption.</p>
<p>This weekend was spent watching more <em>Doctor Who</em> than I care to admit, but to give you an idea, Husband could tell as soon as he got home just from the way I was talking (Oi, whats ‘e on about?). <em>Doctor Who</em> has so many aliens, monsters, wacky characters, plot twists and cliff hangers that if you miss a single episode you’ll miss someone or something awesome, so there is no choice but to watch ALL of them. Apart from that the acting is so strong and breathtaking at times that I will openly admit to weeping like a baby during the more heart wrenching moments. Aliens and destruction of the universe aside, that is what has kept me so strongly invested in the show. The characters are lovable and strong, quirky and human (er, some of them, sort of), vulnerable and consistent except for, you know, all the different people who have played the Doctor.</p>

<p>As an alien The Doctor is able to regenerate new bodies when he has need of them like, say, when his current body is dying (aka the lead actor is stepping out). This is how there have been eleven Doctors. The show first aired in 1963 and ran until 1989 when it was suspended. The BBC brought the series back in 2005 with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001172/" target="_blank">Christopher Eccleston</a> as the Ninth Doctor for a new Season (Series) 1. I must say, that while Eccleston is an exceptional actor, but he’s got nothing on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855039/" target="_blank">David Tennant</a> (Ten) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1741002/" target="_blank">Matt Smith</a>(Eleven) as the Doctor. Tennant and Smith are delightful, terrifying, endearing, brilliant and heartbreaking as the last of the Time Lords.</p>
<p>The music is worth mentioning too. There are T.V. sound tracks, and there is melodic fried Gold. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/murray-gold/id205582333" target="_blank">Murray Gold</a> is responsible for fantastic scores throughout the episodes, which gives them a cinematic quality like no other television show I’ve ever watched. I’ve got quite a collection of songs and soundtracks from my favorite films and shows, and the <em>Doctor Who</em> scores are soon to be among them. This gorgeous, intense, and tender music is expertly woven into the story lines.</p>
<p>Though I’m several states away from my hometown The Doctor and his friends have made me feel at ease in my new abode while they traveled to different times and unseen corners of the universe. Doctor Who is awesome. And British. And readily available on Netflix. Just the dose of comforting BBC television I needed to put me right. I may be a little late to the <em>Doctor Who</em> TARDIS party, but I’m definitely onboard.</p>
