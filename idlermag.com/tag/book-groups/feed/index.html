										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Book group started this week with me sequestered in the backyard. I had about half an hour to read the last 50 pages of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and I was not allowed to enter the kitchen (my kitchen) and hang out with my friends until I was done.</p>
<p>My friend Tiffany, who was the main book group organizer, moved to Colorado a year and a half ago and although we had spoken of keeping the book group going, it fell apart. This past weekend she came back for a visit and we decided to get together again. I had forgotten how bad I am at reading a book I’ve been told to read. It was a difficulty in high school and while I was earning my English degree. In the past two weeks I had read <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, <em>Divergent and Resurgent</em> (Veronica Roth), <em>Delirium</em> (Lauren Oliver), and <em>The Lying Game</em> (Sara Shepard). I started <em>Into the Woods</em> (Tana French) and <em>Never Have I Ever</em> (Sara Shepard). In that same two weeks I read about 80 pages of <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. </p>
<p>So I sat outside, speed reading through great prose while people chatted and snacked inside. The last time I read the book was my senior year in high school. I knew Gatsby died and there was something about a car or car crash. One of my book club members has almost memorized the book but the rest of us were in the same boat. Over-analyzation in high school of the meaning of west vs. east, noting that white stood for purity, that weather matched the emotional states of the characters, that the green light represents hope for Gatsby and that fades when he finally gets Daisy, killed any love we might have had for the book. The book group discussion served to spark a bit of love for F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.</p>
<p>We talked about where Gatsby would have been without his desire for Daisy driving him forward, whether any of the characters really knew how to love, and how we all hated Tom Buchanan. We also watched the movie trailer about five times. I had forgotten how nice it is to talk about how you feel about a book and get instant feedback. </p>
<p>We are a group of mid-twenties to early thirties women and while we all have similar backgrounds we read things differently. I thought all the characters were superficial and self-centered, even Nick who narrates from the sidelines. Others thought Nick, though an unreliable narrator, was a good person, that he had values and cared about more than just himself. We talked about how sudden the onset of Nick’s birthday was, how it changed his narrative style and how he used his age to further distance himself from the lifestyle his “friends” were living.</p>
<p>We read each other our favorite lines and discussed how the repressive, secretive nature of the 1920’s played such a large role in the novel. The decade was almost a character in itself. It made me want to read more F. Scott Fitzgerald and to re-read <em>The Great Gatsby</em> at a normal pace. Knowing the ending won’t change how well it’s written. Nick seems to get a little tired at the end, slowing down his narrative and moving on to the next decade of his life. Despite my trying to read the book as quickly as possible, the ending seemed to happen in slow motion. Gatsby taking a swim and getting shot (I honestly thought maybe he would drown himself, all I knew is that he wouldn’t make it out alive), no one wanting to attend his funeral, Nick calling Gatsby’s father by the wrong name. All of these events slowly swirled around me as my summer also drew to a close.</p>
<p>I think it might be best to read a book twice, especially a classic with its themes and motifs so carefully picked apart by dozens of “professionals,” if you mean to discuss it. The first time you get the story and the characters come to life. The second time you can begin to notice how East matches up with old money, lack of morals, and corruption and West has the pioneer spirit and values earning your own way in the world. If you have to take note of those often drier aspects of a novel your first time around I feel as though a resentment of good, classic fiction builds up.</p>
<p>We discussed getting the book group going again. With Tiffany already back in Colorado, another book group member heading of to New York, and me having a baby (I hear they are a lot of work), I’m not sure it’ll happen. But even if it’s just a few of us getting together when we can to discuss a book we all at least started I’ll be happy. The joy of talking about books will hopefully motive me to be one of the people who finish on time instead of being sent outside until I’m done with my homework.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love to read. I love books. I love the cover art and the heft; I love the way they smell and feel. I love short stories and novels. I like nonfiction and I love fiction, especially science fiction. I’ve never been too fond of short poems but I love the epic ones. If I manage to turn off the TV, I can finish most books in a weekend.</p>
<p>All of that makes it sound like my “books I’ve read” list should be pretty damn impressive. It is if I&#8217;m allowed one small cheat – it can include books I’ve started but never finished.</p>
<p>I can’t blame this one on the TV, or my job, or spending time with friends. I start every book with the intention of finishing it. A coworker of mine starts every book with the same trepidation of someone testing the water with their big toe. If he likes the opening lines he’ll stick his whole foot in, if there is an awkward sentence in chapter two he beats it for the hills.</p>
<p>I like to jump in cannonball style. I can let a flat character go &#8212; maybe they’ll improve later on and I just have to get there. I don’t mind rereading a sentence that doesn’t seem to make sense. If I get the gist of it I can still follow the story. But then I set the book down. Sometimes in favor of a new shiny book, sometimes because I have to go to sleep. The problem is when I never pick it up again.</p>
<p>A different coworker of mine can’t not finish a book. If she opens it she finishes it, but she also reads quickly. I blame her years of law school. She doesn’t pause over well-written sentences or reread heartbreaking scenes; she skims. She comes into work at 11 in the morning and says, “Oh <em>A Crack in the Sky</em>? I read that this morning, it was good, you should read it.” Granted she shelves the Young Adult and Intermediate sections so a lot of her reading material is intended for a younger audience, but she finished Erin Morgenstern’s <em>The Night Circus</em> in record time as well. I’ve been halfway through that particular book for about a month.</p>
<p>If a book is great (in my opinion, of course) I’ll try to finish it in a day or two. I recently lost a day reading <em>Never Let You Go</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro. I had hoped for a little more of the science fiction element when I started, but looking back I would change nothing about that book. The imagery was amazing. His style is so fluid and captivating that it took me half the novel to notice he mentioned light whenever good people or actions occurred and dark for the corresponding bad elements. That type of imagery can be heavy-handed or obvious to the point of making a book unreadable but Ishiguro dealt with the story so beautifully that a ray of sun falling across someone’s cheek felt natural. I think I got up for food but other than that I was rooted to the couch until the last page.</p>
<p>Other books get a less rigorous treatment. I never finished <em>Catch 22</em> (Joseph Heller), <em>Shadow of the Wind</em> (Ruiz Zafon), or <em>Geek Love</em> (Katherine Dunn) when I was in my short-lived book group. I barely started <em>Cloud Atlas</em> (David Mitchell).  The group shed a few members and turned into a Margaret Atwood themed book group and I finished <em>Oryx and Crake</em>, and <em>Year of the Flood</em> but not <em>Cat’s Eye</em>. Since then I’ve started <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> but it’s moving a little slowly so I put it down and now I’m not sure where it went. The book group fell apart when the leader moved out of state, but let’s face it: I was barely keeping up. I am the queen of procrastination.</p>
<p>There is something about being given a deadline to finish a book that makes my inner four-year-old throw a fit. I just put it off for “a few days” in favor of something else. I finished dozens of other books in the time I was in the book club, but the second my eyes fell on the book I was “assigned,” reading turned into a horrible chore. Of course, reading on my own isn’t much better. With no one to keep me in line I can pick up books and set them down all over the place. My house is a mess of stacks and piles. The shelves are too full to fit the new books I bring home (working in a bookstore means there is no <em>not</em> bringing home new books) and I have the perverse need to organize them perfectly “someday.” That day is not today.</p>
<p>I do a delicate balancing act between throwing a book out the window if it’s not beautifully written and suffering through endless pages of tedium just because I had the misfortune to start it.</p>
<p>I know I will finish <em>Perfume</em> (Patrick Suskind) because the story is daring and dark. I know I will love <em>You Don’t Have to be Evil to Work Here, But it Helps</em> (Tom Holt) the next time I try it because I loved his other books, I just wasn’t in the right place for goofy science fiction when I started it. And I know I’ll finished <em>Great Expectations</em> because I love Dickens’ other books, but right now I really don’t care about Pip.</p>
<p>As for books sitting by my nightstand that I’ll never finish I think <em>Crossed</em> (Ally Condie) tops the list. The first book in the trilogy, <em>Matched</em>, was fantastic. It’s Young Adult, but she created a world that was believable and characters who were touching and new. I like to believe <em>Crossed</em> was rushed out by the publishers so people wouldn’t forget about how much they liked the first one and that’s why it falls flat, not that the author lacks talent. Either way, I was very disappointed.</p>
<p>I could list a dozen more books I’ve started and stopped. I like to have more than one book going at a time in case I’m in the mood for something different from one day to the next. Part of the problem with this technique is that if I get too far removed from a book, I’ve forgotten what happened. But the idea of starting over is exhausting. Everything will be vaguely familiar and then I’ll have a bookmark from where I stopped the first time, halfway through, and a bookmark at page 30 because I couldn’t do it again. Maybe I just need to wait a few years and hope that I’ll have forgotten everything about the book. But by then I’ll have enough books to build a small house, with too many new ones to bother reading old ones.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll fully commit to one way of reading or the other; never giving books a second chance or forcing myself to read one that I don’t like just isn’t in me. I think all books have their good points &#8212; great descriptive paragraphs, funny characters, poignant situations &#8212; but that doesn’t mean I want to slog through pages of bad prose just to find the gems.</p>
