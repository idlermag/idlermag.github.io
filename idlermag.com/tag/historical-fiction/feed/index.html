										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a historian, I&#8217;m a sucker for time travel novels. To go back in time and observe is a historian&#8217;s dream. (We&#8217;ll never know, though, even if we were there, exactly what people were thinking and feeling at any given time in history. People are unfathomable. Some things will always be guesses.) In some time travel novels the travelers are scientists, historians, hunters, tourists, or everyday people sucked back in time by a portal. But in my favorite time travel novels, the travelers are immortals.</p>
<p>Kage Baker&#8217;s <em>Company</em> books are some of the best time travel novels ever written, using the genre to talk about memory, time, history, change, and the limits of infinity. Baker, who died too young in 2010, wrote 8 novels and 2 short story collections about immortal time travelers and their shadowy employer, Dr. Zeus Inc. also known simply as “The Company.” It&#8217;s best to start at the beginning, with <em>In the Garden of Iden</em> (1997).</p>
<p>The backstory is that time travel and immortality were invented contemporaneously, in the 24<sup>th</sup> Century. But there are caveats. Time travel is dangerous to normal humans, who can only go into the past and then return to the present, and cannot take anything back from the past with them. And the immortality process only works on children. The Company, then, for money as well as for unspecified nefarious purposes, goes back as far as possible in time and rescues children, starting with Neanderthal children, who would otherwise have died, using nanotechnology to turn them into immortal cyborg operatives. The operatives work through the millenia in real time, with retirement and rewards promised once they reach the 24<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>The heroine of most of the books, the Botanist Mendoza, was rescued from a Spanish Inquisition dungeon and drafted into the Company. Her first mission, in <em>In the Garden of Iden</em>, is to take genetic samples from plants in an 16<sup>th</sup> century English nobleman&#8217;s garden. The teenage Mendoza dislikes the mission (indeed, all cyborgs are raised to hate the past from the perspective of their prudish 24<sup>th</sup> century employers.) But as she learns to do her work she also learns that there is much she hasn&#8217;t been told about humans and human life in history. The book is a great Elizabethan historical novel whose main characters happen to be immortal cyborgs. Of course, Mendoza falls tragically in love. But why do people identical to her lover show up in the future in the other novels?</p>
<p>The work of the Company is to save cultural materials that would otherwise have been destroyed, such as the Library of Alexandria, or various extinct botanical species, to sell in the 24<sup>th</sup> century. Operatives also save important papers in a long scene set during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. This is actually a common trope of time travel books. The idea that objects destroyed in their own time can be moved to the future without upsetting the continuum is a saving revelation in, for instance, Connie Willis&#8217; time travel books. In Baker&#8217;s books, it&#8217;s a commercial proposition. Company operatives hide items in Company caches to last out the millenia till they can be found in the present and sold.</p>
<p>Baker was a Californian and an enthusiast of California history, and it shows. Mendoza is sent to 16<sup>th</sup> century and 19<sup>th</sup> century California as well as to a 150,0000 BCE Catalina Island. In <em>Mendoza in Hollywood</em> (2000) the bored cyborgs watch <em>Intolerance</em>. (Luckily an operative who had been in Babylon is there to point out inaccuracies.)</p>
<p>Company operatives from the far past know all about the future &#8212; up to a particular date in 2355 known as the Silence, when all information stops. What happens then? You&#8217;ll have to read the books. (Hint: the last book is called <em>The Sons of Heaven</em>.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Eva Ibbotson&#8217;s characters are haunted by the war. Which war? It depends on which romantic historical novel we&#8217;re talking about, but one thing&#8217;s for sure: neither her brave heroines nor her strong heroes can ever go back to Vienna.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eva Ibbotson&#8217;s characters are haunted by the war. Which war? It depends on which romantic historical novel we&#8217;re talking about, but one thing&#8217;s for sure: neither her brave heroines nor her strong heroes can ever go back to Vienna.</p>
<p>Ibbotson (1925-2010), the beloved and bestselling author of chapter books for children such as <em>Which Witch?</em> and<em> J<em>o</em>urney to the River Sea</em>, also wrote a number of charming historical romances during the 1980s and 1990s, all recently reissued as YA. (Ibbotson wrote them for adults and was surprised at their popularity among YA audiences.) In each book, a headstrong heroine finds herself in an unfamiliar situation (for instance, the Russian countess, exiled after the Great War, who works as a servant in an English country house in <em>A Countess Below Stairs</em>) where she eventually charms everyone and finds love. The characters are immediately relatable, and their emotions are deeply felt.</p>
<p>Ibbotson and her family fled Vienna for London on the eve of World War II, and that flight colors these novels, where love always comes after struggle, and the happily ever afters are always bittersweet. It is the two world wars that shatter the illusion that St Petersburg (<em>A Countess Below Stairs</em>) and Vienna (<em>A Song for Summer, The Morning Gift</em>) will ever be the friendly, carefree places where her heroines grew up surrounded by love.</p>
<p>The books have flaws, of course. The villians are entirely too villainous: Rupert&#8217;s fiancee in <em>A Countess Below Stairs</em> is entirely hateful, a eugenicist who insults and mistreats the mentally disabled kitchen maid and the kind Jewish neighbors; and Harriet&#8217;s closeminded father in <em>A Company of Swans</em>, who refuses to let her dance in the ballet company (or matriculate at Cambridge, where he is a famous professor) is a one-note caricature of the kind of family one would run away to South America with a ballet company from.</p>
<p>There is always an idyll in these books, a sense that joy is too good to last. This is pronounced in <em>A Song For Summer</em>, where Ellen, the practical daughter of suffragettes who is unaccountably gifted at housekeeping, becomes the matron at an alternative school in Austria and transforms all the rich, eccentric students and teachers with her kindness and levelheadedness. Ellen falls in love with the school&#8217;s caretaker, a Czech concert violinist who has resigned his position in protest against the Reich. Everything is about to end. Ellen and Marek will find each other again after the war, changed. We, the readers, know that the beautiful valley, the children, the storks, the still lake, and Ellen and Marek cannot stay there forever. But how we wish they could.</p>
