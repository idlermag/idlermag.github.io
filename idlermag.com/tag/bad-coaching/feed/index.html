										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even now, I or another of my teammates on one of my co-ed Lansing rec league softball teams will say to a struggling hitter, &#8220;Swing level.&#8221; </p>
<p>My good friend Maggie, who rediscovered her swing the first year I played on her team, said she can always hear her father, <em>good old Ray Striz</em>, telling her to keep her back elbow up when she settles into her stance at the plate.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all wrong. So is the generic, unhelpful advice to &#8220;stay back.&#8221; </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with swinging level. When I was an up-and-comer (read: sixth-grade fast-pitch Little-Leaguer), the chant from the bench was this: Swing level, swing level, and run like the devil. And that&#8217;s fine advice, if your goal is to hit grounders or line drives that don&#8217;t clear the infield and are easily nabbed by the shortstop.</p>
<p>In fact, the path your swing should take is more like a hula hoop tilted skyward at the finish, pointing toward the catcher&#8217;s mask at the low end. Imagine, as I do, the rings of Saturn, turned up 45 degrees. </p>
<p>In making contact with the ball&mdash;getting under it, as Rod Allen would note&mdash;while swinging on an upward track above level, you&#8217;re going to put the ball in the air, leading to either greater power and distance if you&#8217;re a power hitter, or better base-hit line drives if you&#8217;re my size. Which is, to be clear, 5-foot-2 and not very beefy.</p>
<p>When you finish your swing, your bat should be hitting you at the very top of your leading shoulder&mdash;in my case, my left shoulder, as I am a righty. </p>

Notice anything funny? Look at my wrists. My top hand has rolled over the bottom as I finish my swing, which is the telltale sign that you&#8217;re swinging level to a fault. It meant a lot of easy grounders, and an inability to consistently put the ball in the air unless I got a pitch that was already high, and forced me to get under it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the back elbow comes in. Keeping it up doesn&#8217;t help you, my coach says, unless you&#8217;re Ken Griffey Jr. In which case, you probably aren&#8217;t spending your Friday evenings getting drilled with grounders and taking hundreds of swings in the cages.</p>
<p>How can millions of American fathers have been so wrong? Because it&#8217;s actually not so much about the back arm&mdash;and elbow&mdash;as the front arm, and getting your hands through the zone&mdash;with the bat lagging back&mdash;before you push through with the final burst: stiffening the front leg, exploding through the hips and completing that upward arc. </p>
<p>Need a visual? This is about as good as it gets:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/MV9ssAuLE4o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>When I walk onto the field this spring, I want people to mistake my swing for Miguel Cabrera&#8217;s. And, as long as we&#8217;re wishing for insanely unlikely things, my hair, too.</p>
