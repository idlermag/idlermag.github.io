										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Facebook &#8212; it’s the worst, right?!  It makes you lonelier, fatter, stupider, uglier, monosyllabic-er, etc. Every day there’s another study, another headline, another TV news segment about how awful and addicting this horrible site is.  Every day I see people (on Facebook usually) snarking about other people’s usage of FB or even (bless their hearts) swearing it off.  This is all fine.  Really it is.  And all the reasons why people complain about FB are probably smart and valid.  Facebook clearly simplifies our connections down to clicks and LOLs.  It both encourages us to overshare our most mundane activities and undershare meaningful time with flesh-and-blood people.  Yet, in all our hating of this FacePlace of ours and Zuckerberg’s, we might be missing some of the positivity that virtually inhabiting such a space can create.</p>
<p>Now, in the rhetoric of our social media “everyone’s a celebrity” culture, here’s my very important story about how Facebook is meaningful to ME.  You may commence eyeroll, but do keep reading.</p>
<p>Embarrassingly, I’ve always been a people pleaser to the point of doormat-ism.  I would gladly let anyone walk all over me if it meant winning their friendship and securing their approval.  In college, I recall suffering a bit of an identity crisis when I realized that given a simple decision (what to wear, what to buy, what to eat, who to date) I’d freeze up, panicked and at a loss. Did I like that movie? Would I wear those jeans?  I had no idea. Pushed to actually rely upon some internal reaction, some meter in my gut that measured desire, I’d find that I had nothing there except an overwhelming wish to be right, be normal, be exactly whatever other people wanted.  This, of course, is difficult when placed in the presence of multiple people.  </p>
<p><em>He</em> hates Pearl Jam. </p>
<p>But <em>she</em> loves them.</p>
<p>What do YOU think?!</p>
<p>I think I’m peeing my pants and having a heart attack, is what I think.  I cannot possibly continue this conversation and have to go cry, now. Thanks for inviting me to this kegger!  Goodbye, good time friends!  </p>
<p>Dramatic?  Maybe.  Was my social anxiety and need for acceptance that warped and wacky? Definitely.</p>
<p>Somewhere in me I knew what I was about, but I was always so terrified that being myself &#8212; my own weird, silly, smart, and nerdy self &#8212; would never be enough for others. Though I’ve outgrown this sad state quite a bit with time and painful real life experience, presenting myself authentically (whatever that means) remains difficult. Ironically, I find that Facebook, this internet non-place, becomes a useful tool for pushing toward realness.  Yes, we can tweak our status updates and erase information, photoshop pictures and lie in so many fun ways online, but the physical distance from face-to-face encounters and the reliance upon writing that comes part and parcel with using social media also creates a comfortable zone in which to practice being myself.  As an introvert, I can throw ideas, jokes, and opinions out into the ether &#8212; things I might think quietly to myself or whisper to a close friend in “the real world” &#8212; and I can deal with the responses in my own time and space.  The risk feels smaller because I won’t have to nervously wait for a laugh at my quip. If someone disagrees, I have time to think, assess, formulate an answer.  In more typically social scenarios I might just bend to my audience; on FB I can push myself to keep it real, be a little bit braver.  </p>
<p>One could argue that I’m taking a “fake it ‘til you make it” approach, and yes, to some degree this is true.  Like most folks, I’m writing and constructing an online persona that is not 100% tangible.  Much of this “me” is built out of wishes and fantasy.  However, a great portion of this persona is also getting at, unearthing, a me inside that’s quite real and viable but covered up.  This me is angry, strong, unwilling to put up with bullshit.  She’s the one that hates being catcalled, the one that wants to go up to that catcaller and eviscerate him with a feminist diatribe that castrates his will to yell.  She’s also incredibly emotional and okay with this.  She wants to preach empathy, teach everyone that people and relationships matter, that listening takes many shapes.  She’s funny.  She wants to be playful, childish.  Her head’s full of silly songs, she performs operatic renditions of &#8220;Froggy Went a Ridin’&#8221; while taking a shower.  She loves puppy pictures. . . like, a lot.  But that pretty much squares with all versions of myself, I suppose.  Anyway, all these selves have a little more room to breathe, grow, figure themselves out, and go public on Facebook.  I have to dare myself to be as true as I can be, and sometimes, yes, I worry and bite my nails over the backlash, the gossip, the whispers that will come in response.  </p>
<p>Ugh, can she take <em>another</em> picture of herself?  Vain!</p>
<p>Complaining about patriarchy again? Feminazi!</p>
<p>Telling her sad sap life story again? Selfish!</p>
<p>And sometimes I get those negative responses crystal clearly on my page or passive-aggressively in my feed and I’m forced to deal with them and this is good.  Having this place where my audience is not only my closest friends, but colleagues, old teachers, family, strangers, I can’t possibly cater to them all and I’m further forced to find the shape my self takes and can take.  With each post I can push my role of daughter and sister, teacher and friend, writer and feminist out of its comfort zone and hopefully, with this stage set, I can outgrow the limits that the scary, judgey, immediate “real world” presents for me and better represent that online me I really like.</p>
<p>Is Facebook a timesuck?  Yes.  Is it evil in many ways? For sure. But if you’re telling me that I’d be better off in olden days with my sick sad lonely scared self, I’m not buying.  Yes, I could have hermited myself away and written glorious poems to my depressive wounds and people could enjoy my posthumous diaries &#8212; neat!  But, I’d rather FB friend all the modern day Emily Dickensons, build a group page, share our poems, and maybe one day, if we’re really feeling up to it, go out and warm our pallid bodies in the delicious sunshine. Or just continue to chat from home for a while, because, to me, that’s fine, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. Post fewer pictures of my dogs online or post less about my life in general.</strong></p>
<p>Maybe not everyone thinks it’s hilarious when my wiener dog is sleep-farting on the couch.  Dachshunds in various states of repose and/or sporting the latest in blanket burrito fashion may only be of interest to other grad school shut-ins.  Not everyone’s a crazy dog lady—I get it.  But people must at least care about the jerkholes I run into at Starbucks on a daily basis. . . right?!  No.  In fact, since I go to the jerkhole Starbucks I should probably assume that I, too, am one of the jerks in this jerkstore.</p>
<p>Wait, is that a photo of your newborn baby covered in birthing goo bungee jumping out of your wife’s womb sullying my Facebook feed? Yeah. Forget everything I was just resolving.</p>
<p><strong>2. Speaking of feeds, I vow to be less jealous of those people who post about the amazing seven course dinners (juicy photos included) that they “just threw together” while doing a load of laundry, ironing out a pesky chapter in their latest novel, and de-lousing the friendly neighbor child they babysit (free of charge) in the afternoons.</strong></p>
<p>No, I will not be jealous as I eat canned bean surprise (straight from the can &#8212; that’s the surprise!) in my yoga pants that have yet to see the pure and healing stretchy joys of yoga.  Om to you my friends.  Eat heartily!  Think not of me in my bean-stained yoga pants yelling sage advice to Snooki on the TV.  We’re cool.  I swear.</p>
<p><strong>3. This year I will not watch <em>Jersey Shore</em> or any permutation of <em>The Kardashians</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Not even <em>Kim and Khloe: Two Hos in Hoboken</em>?  No, I will be strong.  What if J-Woww brings her cute dogs back to the shore? No.  I have my own dogs to look at.  What if Kourtney goes all weird Mama Zen again and delivers the next kid just like she pulled out Mason?  Well, I already established that I don’t need a peek into anyone’s delivery room (except I already watched one Kardash birth, so the second one is probably okay to watch for the sake of consistency).  And that Lifetime movie where Rob Lowe plays Drew Peterson &#8212; I get to watch that televisual travesty, right?!  Yeah, that’s fine.  And what if <em>The Shore</em> and <em>Kardash</em> are in marathon mode on a Saturday and I’m doing laundry?  Then I can watch them all I want because that doesn’t even count.  *Self high-five*</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I thought you’d given that up," my wife said as she caught me trying to sneak in a few minutes of <em>Mafia Wars</em>.

"I did," I said.

"And yet there you are: click, click, click."

I've actually given up <em>Mafia Wars</em> several times over the past few years, and, believe it or not, this last time has largely stuck. I may have mastered the New York, Cuba, Moscow, and most of the Bangkok job tiers, acquired more weapons, vehicles, and armor than one could ever reasonably hope to warehouse, but several months ago I went cold turkey. I de-authorized the application from my Facebook account, and I stopped requesting and accepting energy packs, mystery bags, and random "limited time" items from friends and strangers.

I gave it up.

Totally.

Really.

It took me a while to figure out why I would want to log in to Facebook ever again.

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet there you are: click, click, click.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually given up <em>Mafia Wars</em> several times over the past few years, and, believe it or not, this last time has largely stuck. I may have mastered the New York, Cuba, Moscow, and most of the Bangkok job tiers, acquired more weapons, vehicles, and armor than one could ever reasonably hope to warehouse, but several months ago I went cold turkey. I de-authorized the application on Facebook, and I stopped requesting and accepting energy packs, mystery bags, and random &#8220;limited time&#8221; items from friends and strangers.</p>
<p>I gave it up.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>It took me a while to figure out why I would want to log in to Facebook ever again.</p>
<p><em>Mafia Wars</em> and other social networking games (particularly games like <em>FarmVille</em>, <em>Treasure Isle</em>, <em>Café World</em>, and <em>FrontierVille</em>, all from <em>Mafia Wars</em> developer Zynga) are often described as the bane of Facebook. Users who just want to catch up with old friends are deluged with requests to adopt a lonely cow, or to join a mafia, or to help eat all the extra hot dogs someone made. It makes no difference that I had my own personal guidelines on sending or not sending requests, or that I only played one game instead of several. The fact remains that I was one of Those People.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><em>Was</em> true.</p>
<p>What my wife saw me doing was just research for this column.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion of social network gaming, it&#8217;s out there, and in a big way. Zynga claims 4 million daily users for <em>Mafia Wars</em> and 230 monthly users for its games as a whole. Clearly, this isn&#8217;t unique users—that is, not 230 million different people—but that&#8217;s still a lot of lonely cows. To give you some sense of scale, the wildly successful <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series sells about 15 million copies per title.</p>
<p>More importantly, for a column with the words &#8220;casual gamer&#8221; in its title, Zynga&#8217;s social network games reach out to demographics who may never play a console or a PC game. A recent study found that the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/02/17/average-social-gamer-is-a-43-year-old-woman/">&#8220;the average player of . . . online social games is a 43-year-old woman.&#8221;</a> Whatever the mechanics, whatever the demographics, social network games are video games, and anyone who wants to think about what video games do needs to take games like <em>FarmVille</em> and <em>Mafia Wars</em> into account.</p>
<p>But even more than that, my own intensive use of the <em>Mafia Wars</em> game forces me to question my thinking about what it is I look for in a video game. I&#8217;ve written before that what I find interesting in video games is linked to what I find enjoyable in literature—narrative, syntax, inventive structure—but <em>Mafia Wars</em> has none of these things. For another user, a good argument could be made that the social functions keep users interested, but I almost entirely neglected the social aspects of the game, and the structure of the game encourages all-or-nothing sociability. As you advance in the game, you quickly find that the majority of players with advanced levels also have the largest possible mafia, and the bonuses the game provides based on mafia size far outweigh individual stats.</p>
<p>So instead of focusing on social &#8220;fights,&#8221; my <em>Mafia Wars</em> play revolved almost entirely around &#8220;jobs&#8221;—tasks I could complete based on how much &#8220;energy&#8221; I had. Completing a job requires energy, and when a player uses up that energy, they have to wait a certain period of time to be given more. Mastering job tiers (or completing all the jobs within a certain set a certain number of times) provides bonuses which mean more energy in less time, or that jobs cost less energy to complete. More jobs leads to more bonuses leads to more jobs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not much, but it kept me playing. In fact, I played a lot. I devoted hours and hours to the game, usually in short, discrete bursts. In fact, that might be the real genius of <em>Mafia Wars</em> and similar games—the marginal cost of participation is close to zero. You may invest hours into the game, but you can do it minutes at a time. It&#8217;s easy to fit a quick session into other tasks, and it&#8217;s often refreshing to do so. The game itself is monotonous—mind numbingly so, in fact—but it provides a constant stream of little rewards.</p>

If the strength of the Nintendo Wii is allowing people to enjoy video games without asking them to master incredibly involved and abstract console controllers like Sony&#8217;s DualShock 3 controller, then Zynga has Nintendo beaten at its own game. <em>Mafia Wars</em> is played almost exclusively with a single mouse button. As my wife observed, a person in the room with a <em>Mafia Wars</em> player hears nothing but an unending series of clicks.</p>
<p>Click.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that Zynga&#8217;s games are repetitive. It&#8217;s true that they function as a virus, providing incentives for players to bring other players into the game, and inflicting <em>de facto</em> penalties on players who don&#8217;t. But it&#8217;s also true that Zynga&#8217;s games offer free, attractive alternatives to $60 games (on even more expensive consoles) that are so complex that a substantial portion of early gameplay is devoted to a series of tutorials. I&#8217;m not ready to claim that Zynga&#8217;s games offer a gateway into more &#8220;serious&#8221; gaming, but for a large number of people who would otherwise never touch a video game, growing their farm or their mafia is serious enough business on its own.</p>
