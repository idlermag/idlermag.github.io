										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doing Two Things Is Confusing</strong><br />
The year is 2000, Amazon, the burgoning internet book seller, splits off their new music department into a website called Nile.com. By 2011 every river has a .com address and is a commerce portal operated by Amazon.com. Over the next 10 years the internet is entirely dominated by single-serving sites. Subdomains don’t exist and more than 8 characters after the .com is considered obscene. As Netflix’s streaming catalog threatens to overshadow its classic DVD by mail program a bewildered public and confused stock market force Netflix to spin off its flagship productline into a new company for clarity’s sake. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Sadists</strong><br />
Fuck you for using our service. No seriously, fuck you. Oh you were just about to finish that streaming movie? <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/08/does-netflix-give-enough-warning-when-streaming-titles-expire.html" target="_blank">NOPE.</a> Expired. Fuck off.  Oh, you want another DVD? <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11262292/ns/business-us_business/t/frequent-netflix-renters-sent-back-line/" target="_blank">NOPE.</a> Slow your roll, asshole. Oh hey, do you want to connect with friends and privately share ratings and recommendations? <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html" target="_blank">NOPE</a>. Maybe try Facebook instead? <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/01/connecting-with-your-friends-on-netflix.html" target="_blank">OH NO WAIT FUCK THAT SHIT.</a> And hey, our way of saying thanks for those years of thoughtful reviews you wrote: <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/06/minor-update-to-member-reviews.html" target="_blank">STRIPPING ATTRIBUTION.</a> No one wants to know your name, bitch. Hey at least our website is easy to use. Do a search and if it’s streaming watch it now, if it’s on DVD add it to your queue. <a href="http://twitpic.com/6n72lq" target="_blank">HAHA FUCK YOU SEARCH TWICE.</a> </p>
<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Masochists</strong><br />
What do you mean you like my variety? I hate that about myself. The future isn’t in discs and my present streaming selection sucks. My core business model is a joke. Spank me on the stock market, abuse me in my comment threads. I deserve it. I don’t know why you keep giving me money anyways. I know everyone is mocking me when they call things “the Netflix of whatever”.  I know they just mean the new failure. I’m going to go cut myself. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix Is Having An Identity Crisis</strong><br />
I’m chopping off my hair, kicking out my core business, and uprooting myself to a different domain. You can call me Starchild Qwikster.  Netflix is my slave name. </p>
<p><strong>All of These Domains Were Already Taken</strong><br />

<p><strong>Netflix: White Collar Squatter</strong><br />
Unhappy with their business model, Netflix decided to follow Google’s. They choose an impossible to remember company name then buy every spelling permutation to show ads against. </p>
<p><strong>Qwikster: Pawn in Corporate Chess</strong><br />
Netflix puts Qwikster up for sale. Amazon buys Qwikster. Netflix buys Hulu. Apple files anti-duopoly lawsuit.  Amazon merges with Netflix, hostilely takes over Apple. Government breaks up iFlixzon. Qwikster only viable model after internet razing war. </p>
<p><strong>An Offer Netflix Can&#8217;t Refuse</strong><br />
In exchange for rights to stream high quality movies, the studios extracted extraordinary measures from Netflix. </p>
<ol>
<li>Reed Hastings&#8217;s must visit each of the studio heads personally and sing &#8220;I am a little teapot.&#8221;</li>
<li>The studios kidnapped Reed Hastings&#8217;s daughter and if he didn&#8217;t comply they&#8217;d sign her to a three picture deal with Eddie Murphy. </li>
<li>In a fit of Scrabble-induced pique, the studios demanded that Netflix must spin off its DVD by mail service into a new website that uses a Q, W, and K, but only two vowels. </li>
<li>The new site cannot use any of Netflix&#8217;s APIs and must be coded by out-of-work humanities PhDs given an <em>HTML For Dummies</em> book. </li>
<li>Netflix is not allowed to blame or even mention the studios as its rationale for these changes. </li>
</ol>
