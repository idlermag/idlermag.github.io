										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few short months ago, rumors began circulating that the Saints were being investigated for what many would consider to be foul play. After a period of speculation and anticipation, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, the Templar of Player Safety, dropped the hammer. Head Coach Sean Payton was suspended for a year, the Saints organization was fined the league-maximum $500,000, and the Saints forfeited their second round draft picks for the 2012 and 2013 seasons. Additionally, GM Mickey Loomis was suspended for the first eight games of the season and assistant coach Joe Vitt  was suspended for six games. </p>
<p>GODdell saved his BFG2000 for ex-Saints and &#8220;current&#8221; Rams defensive coordinator  Gregg Williams: <em>suspended indefinitely</em>. That&#8217;s business-speak for excommunication. Banned. GTFO. </p>
<p>There are other details and fancy language, <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7718136/sean-payton-new-orleans-saints-banned-one-year-bounties" target="_blank">which you can read here</a>.</p>
<p>As far as whether these punishments are necessary and whatnot, well, GODdell made inquiries on this very topic within the Saints organization after the <strong>2009 NFC Championship game</strong>, many moons ago, and continued to do so <em>for years</em>. Some have declared &#8220;player&#8217;s code&#8221; against snitches, but when you stand in solidarity on the boat when the iceberg is coming, well, we know what happened to the Titanic.</p>
<p>The following are excerpts from ESPN&#8217;s coverage (linked above). </p>
<blockquote><p>We are all accountable and responsible for player health and safety and the integrity of the game. We will not tolerate conduct or a culture that undermines those priorities,&#8221; said Goodell, whose league faces more than 20 concussion-related lawsuits brought by hundreds of former players. &#8220;No one is above the game or the rules that govern it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize our fans&#8217; concerns and we regret the uncertainty this episode has created for them. We are humbled by the support our organization has received from our fans today in the wake of this announcement, and we ask them to continue to stand with us, as they have done in the past, when both our team and our city have overcome greater adversities,&#8221; the Saints said in a statement responding to the penalties.</p>
<p>&#8220;To our fans, the NFL and the rest of our league, we offer our sincere apology and take full responsibility for these serious violations. It has always been the goal of the New Orleans Saints to create a model franchise and to impact our league in a positive manner. There is no place for bounties in our league and we reiterate our pledge that this will never happen again.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I recognize that there is a conflict of interest for a player or coach to not wish injury upon another player. After all, the same could happen to them. But that is superstition. There is no correlation between a player injuring another either consciously or inadvertently and that same player&#8217;s own bodily integrity. I am immediately dismissive of &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t want that to happen to anyone because it could happen to us.&#8221; That is much too politically-correct for my tastes. </p>
<p>What I question is the perception of bounties as problematic, especially in the context of a violent sport with strong ties to Vegas. Is an intentional attempt to injure another player simply unsportsmanlike, as Goodell suggests in his &#8220;integrity of the game&#8221; statement? Is it something we would not expect of model citizens? &#8220;Do unto others as you would have done unto you&#8221;?  </p>
<p>If so, that is quite a saintly perspective among bandits, and one would have to honestly say to themselves that winning is, in actuality, <em>not</em> the supreme goal of a professional sport. </p>
<p>I would like to address a counter-point from a colleague:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trying to knock guys on their ass is part of the game, and there&#8217;s no question here. But when you have guys being rewarded by their coaches and other veteran players to intentionally injure opposing players, putting their careers and potentially their lives at risk (especially with this newfound emphasis on preventing concussions) for cash is just despicable. I understand that it&#8217;s just a game, but in the real world, if someone handed you 10 grand to break some guy&#8217;s ankles in the parking lot, that is a crime.</p>
<p>Compounded with the 09 NFCCG when the Saints were prattling on and on about giving Favre &#8220;remember me shots&#8221; and constantly hitting him late after plays (which is what initially spurred the investigation), they really signed their own death warrant in this situation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t really buy the &#8220;potential for life threatening injury&#8221; argument because NFL players have undergone physicals and signed waivers stating &#8220;YOU MAY SUSTAIN INJURY PLAYING THIS SPORT&#8221; since Pop Warner level. A player who is concerned with quality of life should not be in the NFL, and probably not play football at all. </p>
<p>I would buy the &#8220;if this were on the street it would be a crime&#8221; approach, except that football players aren&#8217;t on the street. (Never mind, say, hitting someone in the face outside of the octagon.) We could think of all sorts of hypotheticals, but the fact remains that linebackers are paid millions to bring the pain. Example:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/GYltxqyJC0A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Translation: &#8220;This is all we need! We gonna keep hittin&#8217; them! We gonna keep hittin&#8217; them! They might get back up&#8230; We&#8217;re gon&#8217; hit &#8217;em again! And when they&#8217;re barely hanging on, when they&#8217;re about to go home to momma, we&#8217;re gonna hit &#8217;em in the mouth! We gonna &#8220;bloody&#8221; they nose, we&#8217;re gonna run em to the ground!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like the language of an assault to me. Except it isn&#8217;t either unusual or illegal. </p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to figure out, again, is why any of this should be considered despicable, especially if the action takes place on the football field, with legal hits. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I wrote the above several months ago when my editor asked me for a response to Bounty-Gate. Not too much has changed since then in terms of the scandal itself. An appeal here, an appeal there. What HAS changed are the studies discussing the affects of concussions on players and questions raised concerning football&#8217;s permanence as a viable sport. I&#8217;ll get to that some other time, but I want to say that my failure to complete this piece was a result of not knowing how to proceed beyond where I was without sounding like a stereotypical jock. I was conflicted. Now that football season is upon us, I have had time to think further about why this is really a non-issue. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>People want to see players get smashed</strong></li>
<p>As I mentioned above, the players want to smash and the people want to see it. Google &#8220;Joe Theisman&#8221; for the YouTube video of his injury via Lawrence Taylor and see why his name is practically a euphemism. Hard hits make the SportsCenter top 10 highlight videos. People don&#8217;t watch boxing anymore, not because it&#8217;s corrupt, but because the best fighters today are in the smaller weight classes and they don&#8217;t have the power to knock people out.</p>
<p>I personally am a fan of old-school smash-mouth style football, contrary to the direction football is going with the air-out game. Three yards and a cloud of dust.</p>
<li><strong>The rules revolving around &#8220;player safety&#8221; are heavily focused on facilitating an offensive game.</strong></li>
<p>Chris Canty said that <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-08-14/news/33204036_1_chris-canty-line-depth-markus-kuhn" target="_blank">there is a 100% injury rate in football</a>, so the idea of focusing on &#8220;player safety&#8221; is a bit of a paradox. Individuals such as Junior Seau and what he did to himself are the exception, not the rule. Some injuries are worse than others but everyone plays hurt. In fact, Goodell wants to expand the season, which is RIDICULOUS AND HYPOCRITICAL if he is, in fact, concerned about player health.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we have new rules, such as this one from 2011: </p>
<blockquote><p>A receiver who has completed a catch is a “defenseless player” until he has had time to protect himself or has clearly become a runner. A receiver/runner is no longer defenseless if he is able to avoid or ward off the impending contact of an opponent.  Previously, the receiver who had completed a catch was protected against an opponent who launched and delivered a blow to the receiver’s head </p></blockquote>
<p>To a fan of the defensive game, this is infuriating. Before this rule change, defensive players intentionally hit receivers violently to jar the ball from the after a catch to force an incomplete pass. Now, the most one can hope for is a fumble, but even that is unlikely because the receiver would have had time to solidify possession of the ball and prepare for the incoming assaults. Wide receivers like Calvin Johnson and Larry Fitzgerald are bigger, faster, stronger now, so who was the focus when this rule change came about? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhET1IC0gMo" target="_blank">DeSean Jackson, who, contrary to all the fuss, was hit legally</a>. Robinson hit him in the shoulder, rather than the head. Jackson weighs 200 pounds soaking wet with a brick in his pocket, so of course he is going to get blown up going across the middle.</p>
<p>Combined with defensive holding penalties and pass interference rules, there is little defensive players can do but watch and try to react as receivers zip by them. Big hits with running backs against linebackers are rare, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4iUUPNPPHg" target="_blank">but they do happen</a>. (The hit there is helmet to helmet, by the way.)</p>
<p>Speaking of helmet-to-helmet hits, the only positions where there is 100% contact on every play is lineman. Defensive and offensive. They&#8217;re basically sumo wrestlers for sixty minutes, head, spine, and hips. Where is the concern for these guys &#8212; the most likely to play concussed all game? We don&#8217;t take notice of them because the cameras are not following them, and it&#8217;s a cardinal sin, more at this position than any other, to complain about pain.</p>
<li><strong>Overprotective rules encourage Bounty Gate to exist.</strong></li>
<p>Imagine the NFL mades a special rule that if a player displayes symptoms of a concussion, then they cannot return to the game. Think about it: if the concussion rule requires players to sit out, defensive coordinators can sacrifice a knight/rook/bishop for a queen &#8212; Aaron Rogers for &#8220;insert player here&#8221; &#8212; because nobody on either side of the ball is as valuable. This used to be a running joke, trying to intentionally take someone out with a sacrifice player. That&#8217;s different from hitting a wide receiver &#8220;crossing the face of a linebacker&#8221; as we call it, to check a receiver from doing so in the future, or hitting him so hard that he will &#8220;remember&#8221; and have butterfingers next time.</p>
<p>Seriously, someone is going to have to explain why knocking the star quarterback out of the game is not a sound strategy in today&#8217;s pass-happy NFL. This is Sun Tzu stuff we&#8217;re talking here. If Michael Vick isn&#8217;t in the game, the defensive side of the same team has added pressure on them because they know the backup isn&#8217;t as good even if they say he is &#8212; if he were as good, he would be STARTING somewhere. </p>
<li><strong>Money isn&#8217;t an issue.</strong></li>
<p>Some have argued that cash prizes are suspect. We&#8217;re talking about people who make hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars here. (Why? See observation #1.) The bounties are chump change that only Uncle Sam would be concerned about.</ol>
<p>We as a culture say we don&#8217;t want to see players get hurt (because many of them are our sons after all), and we clap and cheer when a player can get off the field without a stretcher because it&#8217;s proper etiquette &#8212; etiquette in a gladiator sport. That sounds akin to practicing ethics during full-scale war. No, football is hell, where there are no Saints.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Maurice Pogue</strong> spends his time spoiling the fun by taking the joke too seriously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m writing this essay acknowledging how precarious it is to take what would appear to be a dissenting stance in the aftermath of what took place at Pennsylvania State University for only God knows how long. I would like to, if possible, sensibly evaluate the repercussions of  PSU&#8217;s behavior. I am aware of how I might be perceived in using quantifying language, but that is what we choose to do when we render judgment upon actions &#8212; or in this case, inactions &#8212; we deem intolerable. </p>
<p>Remember Southern Methodist University? Many did when wondering what should happen to PSU. SMU is practically a metaphor for the Death Penalty, which is termination of all football operations for one year. In fact, a story broke that <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/8199905/penn-state-nittany-lions-rodney-erickson-said-school-faced-4-year-death-penalty" target="_blank">PSU could have faced a four-year Death Penalty</a>, suggesting that what the penalties the NCAA actually imposed were an Act of Mercy.</p>
<p>Negative. The NCAA&#8217;s suggestion of a 4-year death penalty is the equivalent of drawing a Royal Flush and raising the ante knowing your last opponent has to go all-in or fold lest they not have enough money to buy into the next hand. </p>
<p>I do not think that those hoping for the Death Penalty fully appreciate how the virtual termination of football would impact that community. We&#8217;re talking about economic quality-of-life here, not just football. I can remember when I was in college, and my roommate depended upon working security at Auburn University home games for gas money, and his 1988 Mitsubishi Gallant was almost always close to &#8220;E.&#8221; And that&#8217;s just a nominal, anecdotal example. Think about the hotels, restaurants, and apparel stores that would be affected by a complete football ban. The NCAA would not just be punishing PSU, but executing a college town. Scorched Earth economics for decisions made by administrators with whom most people in town may have never had contact. </p>
<p>These are among the reasons why I do not buy the &#8220;it&#8217;s just football&#8221; critique. Such approaches follow the path of making the political choice to not buy at a certain store because of its business practices, and that decision trickles down to the employee whose hours are reduced because of a lack of patronage (ironically, the cost differential between profit and hourly wages is called &#8220;labor&#8221;). And that is before considering how football, or sports in general, change lives. That grotesquely fat kid everyone made fun of is now, after a year of training, the most-sought offensive guard in the state, probably winning javelin competitions in the spring. The dude who never took school seriously is now a pseudo-scholar because he needs the grades for eligibility. To suggest that sports are superfluous luxuries&#8230;no, that only works at the professional level where players are unionized.</p>
<p>The SMU and the various universities that were recipients of the Death Penalty were justified in their plight for violations that had to do with <em>the competitive nature of the relevant sport</em>. We&#8217;re talking player and coaching recruiting violations, bribes, gambling, throwing games, manipulating scores, and professional players posing as college athletes. The closest PSU equivalent that I can come up with is that Jerry Sandusky&#8217;s persistent employment once the Athletic Director was notified of his behavior would be considered as PSU maintaining &#8220;an unfair competitive advantage&#8221; over its competition. Yes, Sandusky will forever be synonymous with the boogey-man, but he was a football coach, and concretely evaluating how he could influence players&#8217; football IQ and morale simply isn&#8217;t possible, let alone to the degree that his presence would be deemed unfair, particularly at a school known historically for its defense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the camp where I do believe that PSU as an institution did indeed fail from a LEGAL standpoint, but legal questions are handled by the justice department, not the NCAA. I resist saying that PSU failed from a &#8220;moral&#8221; standpoint because we&#8217;re talking about the NCAA, a billion-dollar industry, and I have yet to encounter such an industry that I would consider pristine in its business practices, and I am not the kind of person who engages in the mental gymnastics of convincing myself that one injustice is of greater importance than another, and therefore, should accrue penalties accordingly. I didn&#8217;t think that Michael Vick&#8217;s dog-fighting ring was a big deal. But Uncle Sam did, and that is something many fail to remember, if not understand completely: Vick did not do time for the dog fighting. For that alone, he would have been placed on probation with a heavy fine, and maybe community service. House arrest at the worst. He went to jail because the monies that were circulated in the dog fighting operation were <em>his</em>, and the IRS did not receive its cut. </p>
<p>But back to PSU and Sandusky, &#8220;He shouldn&#8217;t have been there&#8221; does not justify the hammer the NCAA threw down. </p>
<p>The least of the sanctions is the $60 million-dollar fine (I say this because, of course, I&#8217;m a high-roller, right?). If I am getting my facts correct, is the equivalent to the total annual earnings the university produces via its football program. Stiff, but not insurmountable. The university will be paying it over the course of several years rather than how the NFL fines its players by taking the money directly from the check. And of course, with trustees in play, we&#8217;re technically dealing with inexhaustible resources. </p>
<p>That four-year bowl ban is huge. HUGE! We&#8217;re talking, if you come to Penn State as a senior, you might never have a post-season (red-shirts considered). If by some miracle Penn State were able to go undefeated, it would be a profound joke because they could not be considered champion (Behold: A half-decade of SEC dominance has finally convinced the NCAA that it does care about a true champion and is moving toward a <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8099187/ncaa-presidents-approve-four-team-college-football-playoff-beginning-2014" target="_blank">four team playoff</a>). Of course this will cripple recruiting. What 5-star athlete would commit career suicide by choosing a school with such a scarred reputation? There is no appeal, no extra luster. No promise of leaving the frigid midwest in late December and early January for Florida or California.  </p>
<p>There is then the scholarship reduction, from 85 total to 65 for four years. It isn&#8217;t as devastating as the experts claim. Yes, you need and want depth on your teams, and it would be ideal to secure talent for the future, but again, you are not going to be able to attract top-tier talent if they have no chance of competing against the best, playing &#8220;under the lights&#8221; as we say, Prime Time after the Christmas leftovers have been devoured. Without the bowl ban, however, I might think that PSU would feel the aching impact of its scholarship reduction. A team has to field eleven guys at a time. Twenty-two for offense and defense, another fifteen for special teams (unique kicker and punter included, return specialists as well) makes for thirty-seven players in total. Throw in substitutions, and I&#8217;ll give you fifty players, with fifteen to spare for 65. A football program can manage, but yes, they will be relegated to mediocrity. </p>
<p>All of these sanctions are more or less severe. &#8220;Worse than the Death Penalty&#8221; some have said. Others, &#8220;You WISH you were dead.&#8221; But I sincerely do not believe that any of them are as myopic as what the NCAA did to PSU&#8217;s golden calf. </p>
<p>The last penalty is a &#8220;legacy&#8221; penalty, one that impacts Joe Paterno&#8217;s (posthumous) reputation. I seriously wonder if the NCAA remembered who performed the molestations. If we want to render &#8220;enabler&#8221; as a synonym for an accomplice, then we&#8217;re now talking about the patrons and owner of bars as culpable for drunk driving friends and patrons. It is a reach. </p>
<p>The NCAA vacated 112 PSU wins, dating back to 1998 when Jerry Sandusky was the defensive coordinator and Mike McQueary was quarterback.  </p>
<p>Let that sink in for a moment.</p>
<p>Done? Ok. Now we know that the NCAA is trying to send the nation the message that &#8220;the university establishes an athletic culture and daily mindset in which football will never again be placed ahead of education, nurturing and protecting young people&#8221; as Mark Emmert has said. That&#8217;s fine, as most of the penalties entail, but altering the wins record is a superfluous gesture. What purpose does it serve? Ensuring that Joe Paterno will not be associated with being one of the greatest NCAA coaches of all time?  Records are one thing, but memories are another, and the NCAA has no MiB Neuralyzers for those who have been positively impacted by the sixty-two years Paterno was at Penn State, and they are legion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can still remember the debates on local sports radio channels when I moved to Michigan in 2006 concerning a possible rematch between Ohio State and Michigan in the 2007 BCS Championship Game. However I will have to beg the reader&#8217;s pardon because being from the South, I am simply unable to replicate all of the pomp and circumstance concerning the anticipation of two <em>non-SEC</em> 11-0 teams playing for a bid in the national championship game, nor do I observe the &#8220;tradition&#8221; of this NCAA rivalry, as currently, universities jockeying for position in an association of 100+ teams are playing conference musical chairs, <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/the_bonus/11/22/am.texas.rivalry/index.html" target="_blank">destroying one-hundred and twenty year-old rivalries such as Texas vs Texas A&amp;M</a> for a chance to play in one of several seventeen-million dollar bowl games (and ask UConn if <a href="http://communityvoices.sites.post-gazette.com/index.php/sports/bob-smiziks-blog/26633-despite-large-bcs-payout-uconn-will-lose-money-at-fiesta-bowl" target="_blank">if it&#8217;s worth it</a>.  I mean, I recognize that OSU and Michigan play in two of the largest stadiums in NCAA football, and well, I can&#8217;t honestly say that they represent programs of integrity given what happened with <a href="http://news-herald.com/articles/2011/12/30/sports/nh4912796.txt" target="_blank">Tressell</a> and what he did to Lloyd Carr. But yet there is something about these schools and their rivalry where fans of ESPN and elsewhere believed that a rematch of the 42-37 final score was worth entertaining in debate. </p>
<p>I personally thought much of it was fan fanaticism. But it was intense enough such that I was legitimately afraid that the Florida Gators would get snubbed &#8212; and I&#8217;m a Florida State Fan!  </p>
<p>As it turns out, both Michigan and Ohio State would proceed to get crushed in their respective ensuing bowl games. </p>
<p>Five years later, and after the dust has settled, we will indeed see a rematch, but under different circumstances. That 42-37 OSU/Michigan score is sexy to many football fans, but a rematch between the two teams responsible for the 6-9 #1 vs #2 final score, Alabama/LSU, has mostly generated disgust.  </p>
<p>I personally do not understand it. How can a college football game possibly be more competitive than 6-9 <em>in overtime</em>? Indeed, that final field goal came after regulation time when Nick Saban basically out-coached himself, drawing illegal huddle penalties and failing to put the ball in the hands of Trent Richardson on Alabama&#8217;s first and only offensive possession in OT, while Les Miles and LSU could settle for an easy FG. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is the condition of the present-day football fan with short memories of when the option ruled the days of college football, when &#8220;smash-mouth&#8221; was a term more circulated than &#8220;spread.&#8221; I personally find astronomical football scores annoying. The stoppages in playtime from all the incomplete passes, WRs catching near or running out of bounds, and changes in possession prolong the game more than necessary. The Washington Huskies and Baylor Bears just put up 1,399 combined yards of offense and a final score of 67-56. That might be acceptable for a final score in college basketball, but not football at any level. There&#8217;s quality football and then there&#8217;s a mockery of football. </p>
<p>Some have argued that Oklahoma State should have usurped Alabama in the #2 spot after thrashing Oklahoma in the last game of the season 44-10. But earlier in the season, their one loss came to the lowly Iowa State (credit, if possible: the game went into overtime). Many have projected and speculated that Oklahoma State could be a serious contender versus LSU or Alabama given its explosive offense, but we&#8217;re talking about <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/story/15943320/nflready-talent-aplenty-on-display-for-lsualabama" target="_blank">NFL-ready rosters</a> between LSU and Alabama.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but you are not going to get more competitive than a 6-6 score going into overtime to decide the winner in a National Championship game. We would prefer to have a <em>true</em> national champion over a &#8220;popular&#8221; one, yes? That&#8217;s the purpose of the BCS, isn&#8217;t it? #1 vs #2? The two best teams playing?</p>
<p>If we want to talk about snubs, and who-should-be-playing-in-what-game, then let&#8217;s talk about how Michigan State University is for the second year in a row left in the dust when it comes to BCS love. In 2011, they were co-co-co champions with Wisconsin and Ohio St.* Guess which two teams got to go to BCS bowl games? (Hint: one of them wasn&#8217;t MSU.) This year, Nebraska joined the Big 10, creating a championship game. MSU beats both Michigan and Wisconsin during the regular season, but loses to Wisconsin in the &#8220;extra&#8221; conference championship game, falling in rankings, facilitating Wisconsin&#8217;s second consecutive trip to the Rose bowl and Michigan&#8217;s trip to the Sugar Bowl to play ACC champion Virgina Tech. And get this: even the runner-up of the ACC championship game, Clemson, is playing in a BCS bowl: the Discover Orange Bowl. </p>
<p>Now, before we begin entertaining questions of Alabama going to the National Championship game without winning its conference, tell me what is up with all the MSU disses?</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re done figuring it out, I dare you to look me in the eye and say with a straight face that the NCAA is a superior product to the NFL because they &#8220;don&#8217;t play for money.&#8221; </p>
<p>I dare you.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
