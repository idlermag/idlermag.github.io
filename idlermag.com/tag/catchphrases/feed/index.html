<blockquote><p>“He’s got a mean streak,” says his manager, Sparky Anderson. “As mean as Pete Rose. That’s saying the best thing that could be said about a ballplayer.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of weak aspects to my game – hence hiring a coach to convert me into a real, badass third baseman, aka #Project3B.</p>
<p>But despite <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/11/02/project-3b/">my affinity for miming the Rocky training sequence</a>, my adoration of <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/26/suggested-halloween-costumes-for-my-party-saturday-baseball-playoffs-edition/">complete badasses like Brian Wilson</a>, and my freakish ability <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/motheroflight/status/29592060227">to not notice somewhat hardcore injuries until well after the fact</a>, I still have a hard time with my game face.</p>
<p>Last Friday, I convinced (read: asked a few times, sweetly) my best friend Debbie, to join me in my #Project3B shenanigans. Of course, I had ulterior motives, including expanding the range of awesome milady performs on the field this summer. </p>
<p>Whereas the first lesson, I was Too. Fucking. Exhausted. to perform my standard “can’t go more than five minutes without cracking jokes” act (at least they’re funny, I’m told), Debbie’s presence was fabulous in a few awesome ways. First, I wasn’t the only one performing the drills, so I wasn’t So. Fucking. Exhausted. so fast. (Also, we learned that Debbie has a wicked arm and can field well. Holla, all-girl infield!)</p>

<p><strong>Coach</strong>: “Don’t get lazy, A, keep your ass down!”<br />
<strong>Angela</strong>: Fields grounder (barely), mutters under breath, “That’s what she said.”<br />
<strong>Debbie</strong>: (Quietly) Actually, that’s what he said.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah. Maybe it’s conditioned, partly, in girls&mdash;even girls like me, who regularly wear 3 to 4-inch heels, drink scotch, smoke cigars and are told by male friends, “You’re like a man in a hot chick’s body”&mdash;to take direction well from men with authority but feel the need to offset it with a giggle.</p>
<p>(I have also been known to respond to internal work emails with a well-timed “That’s what she said” as well.)</p>
<p>But it all begs the question: can I become a great (or hell, just plain better than 80% of my competitors) co-ed beer-league softball infielder if I can’t be “mean” like Gibby&mdash;if I’m more likely to bite my cheeks to keep from guffawing when my coach, fixing my swing (another catastrophe, to be explored next week) says, “Don’t get stiff too early?”</p>
<p>I don’t know what it all means, kids. I don’t know how long it’s going to take for me to be more “Hearts on Fire” and less Weird Al’s “I’m Fat,” but it’s safe to say it’s more than two sessions with the coach. Whose nice silver watch, incidentally, helps me focus when I’m trying to override my inane urges. </p>
<p>(That’s what she said.)</p>
