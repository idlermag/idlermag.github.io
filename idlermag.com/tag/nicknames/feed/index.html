										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, my friend Zack sent me a link to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/sports/great-sports-nicknames-like-magic-are-disappearing.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=sports" target="_blank">the New York Times bit about the lack of legendary nicknames</a>, a subject <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/07/the-importance-of-being-ernie-not-ernest-or-how-nicknames-make-legends/">I meditated on</a> way back at the beginning of this column&#8217;s career. </p>
<p>The <em>Times</em>, of course, picking up on something that&#8217;s been written better and with more nuance by people who actually enjoy and watch the sport&mdash;i.e., not just a Yankees fan&mdash;is not news. That the paper&#8217;s home team roster is jam-packed with nicknameless players, and the player whose absolutely derivative moniker started the worst trend this side of hipsters, is simply the Cool Whip on the strawberry shortcake.</p>
<p>But all snark aside, it is time that I finally attempt to answer my own question: </p>
<p>What, then, should we be calling these men?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an agency of limited resources (being just one very small woman with a bruised up knee from the douchebag who knocked me over at third because, hey, who slides for close plays anyway?), so let&#8217;s tackle the neediest player first.</p>
<p>Lucky for you and my knee, the excellent folks over at <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/" target="_blank">Pitchers &amp; Poets</a>&mdash;who also brought us <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/1990s-first-baseman-week/" target="_blank">90s First Baseman Week</a> and <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/16/casting-call-1990s-first-basemen-as-saved-by-the-bell-characters/" target="_blank">90s First Basemen as Saved By The Bell Characters</a>&mdash;identified a worthy young man: one <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/14/miguel-cabrera-the-man-with-no-nickname/" target="_blank">Jose Miguel Cabrera</a>.</p>
<p>During a game against the Blue Jays last week, Miguel scored from first on a Brennan Boesch hit. The big man lumbered as gracefully as a man his size could on his approach toward home, sort of like a 747 landing: if you watch it and think about it, it&#8217;s amazing it ever happens without anyone dying. </p>
<p>The inimitable Rod Allen (<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/04/19/5086/">who you know I love</a>) remarked, during the slow motion replay, &#8220;And the Big Fella, carrying the mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, of course The Big Fella is a kind of adorable nickname, but it&#8217;s more a term of endearment than a moniker on equal footing with Prince Albert or Sparky or even, yes, A-Rod. </p>
<p>In a bit of serendipity, earlier that day Jim Leyland <a href="http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2011/05/detroit_tigers_first_baseman_m_1.html" target="_blank">reflected on Miguel&#8217;s workhorse ethic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>…His back was sore and he has a big bruise on his leg. But he plays. That kid, he&#8217;s a champ. He&#8217;s like the mailman&mdash;rain, sleet or snow and he shows up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cabrera, the only Tiger to start all 36 games, was in the American League&#8217;s top 10 in batting average (.320), home runs (seven) and RBIs (24).</p>
<p>What should we call this man, who plays every day and just hits and hits and hits, who never seems to think that what he&#8217;s doing is anything spectacular&mdash;as Carl Crawford said, Cabrera is always talking about how he is struggling at the plate, can&#8217;t get comfortable, all the while hitting .360&mdash;who just seems to go back to the plate each day and put together a quality at-bat?</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking I&#8217;m about to suggest, but you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>Il Postino.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one part The Great Bambino, one part working class hero. </p>
<p>It fits, no? </p>
<p>Il Postino. </p>
<p>In a place like Michigan, where we had one 80 degree day last week and we&#8217;re getting frost tonight, you need a guy with a slightly postal approach to life&mdash;a guy who can weather any storm, be it one of his own making or one of God&#8217;s.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Now think again of the legends. Think of their names – their nicknames, infinitely more powerful and weighted with meaning than their given names.

The Great One. The Intimidator. The Great Bambino.

Now think of the names of the men who hope to be legends, or who played hard enough to perhaps, one day, be a footnote to legendary days:

The Perfect Storm. The Answer. Little Ball of Hate. King James. Prince Albert.

Now think of the great athletes of our time, and how devoid they are of excellent, aspirational names: Miggy. Manny. A-Rod. K-Rod. And so on and so forth.

None of these men will ever be great men (here I am reminded of the absurd song from Gang of Four) so long as their names offer no direction, nothing to become (an intimidator, a bearer of greatness) and begin no prophetic cycle of legend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone needs a good nickname – at least, any athlete who aspires to greatness. </p>
<p>Think back to that great baseball movie of my childhood (you, gentle reader, may not be the same age as I), <em>The Sandlot</em>. Hamilton Porter is doing his best impression of The Great Bambino, when the loveable Smalls intimates that he didn’t know who said Bambino was.</p>
<blockquote><p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyFaLT-L2uk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe><br />
Squints: You&#8217;ve never heard of the sultan of swat?<br />
Kenny: The titan of terror.<br />
Timmy: The colossus of clout!<br />
Tommy: The colossus of clout!<br />
Benny Rodriguez: The king of crash, man. </p></blockquote>
<p>What’s key to this whole scene is that the boys never once refer to the player by his “real” name, Babe Ruth. Which, of course, is in itself simply a lesser nickname. And of course the whole refusal to call the Babe by his name sets up a fabulous turn of events at the end of the movie </p>
<blockquote><p>Squints: Where did your old man get that ball?<br />
Smalls: I don&#8217;t know. Some lady gave it to him. She even signed her name on it&#8230; Ruth. Baby Ruth.</p></blockquote>
<p>wherein the mysterious owner of the dog, The Beast, that has terrorized the boys, reveals himself to have been a friend of the legend, whom he calls….GEORGE!</p>
<p>Deep breath.</p>
<p>The whole issue of names as signifiers, and perhaps even as predictors of personhood is perhaps more academic territory than I am qualified or willing to cover. But let’s delve in anyway. </p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_307" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-307" data-attachment-id="307" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/07/the-importance-of-being-ernie-not-ernest-or-how-nicknames-make-legends/plato1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg" data-orig-size="203,248" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="plato1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=203" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=203" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=640" alt="Plato" title="plato1"   class="size-full wp-image-307" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg 203w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/plato1.jpeg?w=123 123w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /><p id="caption-attachment-307" class="wp-caption-text">I like the way she thinks. Also Ty Cobb. I love Ty Cobb. The Georgia Peach, they called him.</p></div>What if names, nicknames, signifiers (chair, table, couch) don’t simply attach a series of sounds to make it easier to communicate, but actually somehow denote and in turn FORM the essence of the thing they’re pointing to? </p>
<p>Not so radical, right? The word “couch” would always signify that lovely leather number parked alongside the fireplace, and would also somehow inherently refer to the object’s intrinsic “couch-ness.” </p>
<p>Now, what if nicknames worked the same way? What if, the day Dale Earnhardt became “The Intimidator,” he was both assigned a mission – named what he should become – and was somehow changed by that naming? </p>
<p>It’s cyclical. It’s the very cliché of the self-fulfilling prophesy. </p>
<p>Now think again of the legends (another wonderful trope of <em>The Sandlot</em>, by the way – when the Babe emerges from a closet to christen Benny a legend and tells him that heroes get remembered but legends never die.)</p>
<p>Now think of their names – their nicknames, infinitely more powerful and weighted with meaning than their given names.</p>
<p>The Great One. The Intimidator. The Great Bambino.</p>
<p>Now think of the names of the men who hope to be legends, or who played hard enough to perhaps, one day, be a footnote to legendary days:</p>
<p>The Perfect Storm. The Answer. Little Ball of Hate. King James. Prince Albert.</p>
<p>Now think of the great athletes of our time, and how devoid they are of excellent, aspirational names: Miggy. Manny. A-Rod. K-Rod. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>None of these men will ever be great men (here I am reminded of the absurd song from Gang of Four) so long as their names offer no direction, nothing to become (an intimidator, a bearer of greatness) and begin no prophetic cycle of legend. </p>
<p>Their nicknames, even, lack the sound and the fury – and still signify nothing.</p>
<p>What, then, should we be calling these men? </p>
