<p>Mysterious, floppy-haired, droopy-jeaned, an excellent leaner, Jordan Catalano of <em>My So-Called Life</em> is the archetypal irresistible slacker bad boy of your dreams.  He seems perfect because (besides being beautiful) he is quiet and deep, soulful, full of longing.  He plays guitar, wears vintage/thrift store clothes (or is he poor?!  Sad puppy!) and he can’t read.  It is clearly your duty/destiny to keep his tender secrets, make out with him whilst touching his greasy locks and make sure he graduates high school.  </p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong> his mystery may just be emptiness.  He won’t hold hands with you in the light of day (let alone in front of Tino).  Once the poetic mid-smooch mumblings are gone, what will you have left to talk about?  Girlfriend, Catalanos must roam free in the angsty wilderness.  If you love him, let him go.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Daniel Desario <img data-attachment-id="5781" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/06/08/the-catalano-factor%e2%80%94tv-boys-who-look-good-but-aren%e2%80%99t-good-for-you/attachment/2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2.jpg" data-orig-size="235,179" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2.jpg?w=235" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2.jpg?w=235" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2.jpg?w=640" alt="Daniel Desario" title="2"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-5781" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2.jpg 235w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/2.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px" /></p>
<p>Foxy, easygoing, carefree, Daniel Desario of <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> fame is a freak of hottie proportions.  Lanky and loveable, he shoots sweet smirks in your direction across the cafeteria table he non-chalantly invited you to sit at.  He stays out late, drives a sweet car, skips class and here’s the sexy part&mdash;he always asks you along!  This must mean that he loves you!  Why would he be so nice, so flirty, so easy and unimaginably cool?!  He’s not like your last crush, Jordan, at all!</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  he’s a total high school con man&mdash;a grifter in a leather jacket.  Sure he thinks you’re an okay chick and all (for a brainy square, you’re kinda cute) but he mostly wants you for your homework, your excellent house party digs and whatever fleeting entertainment you can provide.  This kid has acting chops that will get him through life.  As adorable as he is playing D&amp;D with your little brother, Desarios can’t be trusted.  </p>

<p>Okay, so he’s not the most classically beauteous of the bunch, but as far as bad boys go, he’s got the attractive attitude down pat.  Let’s face it, funny is sexy and Dave’s got funny in spades.  And this isn’t your run-of-the-mill humor either, this is mean, satirical, wry, jerky, weird and intellectually inane stuff.  There’s something refreshing about a television figure who doesn’t pander to his guests (take a cue Jay Leno).  If Dave respects you, you know you’ve earned it; if he doesn’t, he will verbally eviscerate you on camera then re-air the footage ad nauseum.  Uber private and hermit-like, he’s got the secretive thing going like the dudes above, he loves his mama and he’s fiercely smart.  What’s not to like?</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  Um, commitment issues like whoa.   It’s all well and good to not be the marrying kind, but don’t cheat on your looong time girlfriend, the mother of your child, with each and every broad who works in the CBS studios.  The snark is attractive, but boys like Dave use that crap to keep people at a distance.  I don’t care if you get the urge, do not hop on his desk and show him your boobies.  He won’t show you much in return.  </p>

<p><img data-attachment-id="5784" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/06/08/the-catalano-factor%e2%80%94tv-boys-who-look-good-but-aren%e2%80%99t-good-for-you/attachment/4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/4.jpg" data-orig-size="389,174" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/4.jpg?w=389" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/4.jpg?w=640" alt="Alex Karev" title="4"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-5784" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/4.jpg 389w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/4.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/4.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></p>
<p>Not McDreamy or McSteamy, Alex Karev’s nickname is “Evil Spawn.”  Sounds hot and unavailable already, am I right, ladies?!  So, this <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em> guy is a total ass.  He’ll walk all over you, steal your surgeries and then laugh in your face about it.  But then, then! You catch him whispering lullabies to a preemie in critical condition and your heart melts like so many hospital cafeteria pats of butter.  He had a rough family life, a mentally ill mother, an abusive father, of course he had to be rough and scratch his way to the top.  Of course, he’s all dark and twisty and sexilicious.  Following Freud to a <em>t</em>, he tends to fall hard for crazy girls.  You’re a crazy girl!  You understand why he acts out, why he is how he is.  It’s a match made in Mercy Grace heaven!</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  He sleeps with everyone and he’s not just a little damaged, he’s got serious problems.  Good guy over all? Yes.  But he fights hard and dirty to protect himself, and you don’t deserve that abuse.  Let him work on himself for a while.  Re-visit after he’s had some therapy.  Maybe when he’s head of pediatrics.  Until then, avoid running into him in closets, sleeping quarters, or empty rooms of any kind.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Don Draper <img data-attachment-id="5786" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/06/08/the-catalano-factor%e2%80%94tv-boys-who-look-good-but-aren%e2%80%99t-good-for-you/attachment/5/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5.jpg" data-orig-size="145,193" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="5" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5.jpg?w=145" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5.jpg?w=145" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/5.jpg?w=640" alt="Don Draper" title="5"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-5786" /></p>
<p>The Big Kahuna.  <em>Mad Men</em>’s Don Draper is the Everest of bad boys.  You know, you climb on because it’s just majestically there.  Wow, I’m dirty.  Anywho, he’s gorgeous, sleek, dressed oh-so-finely.  Oozing confidence, one flick of his cigarette says, “even I would fuck me.”  On top of this already selling attitude, he has the magical Desario effect of feigning rapt interest in you along with a little softness, a quiet dreamy impenetrable depth.  He thinks aloud; he lets you see his creativity burst forth so you think you’ve witnessed a little miracle.  He says All. The. Right. Things.  He’s a hot commodity and you’re buying it.</p>
<p><strong>Why he’s bad:</strong>  come on, anything that lovely can’t be real.  He’s a lie wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in five more lies.  Go ahead and sleep with him if you must, but know that you’re just buying a ticket to the Don Draper experience.  I repeat, DO NOT MARRY.  He is for amusement purposes only.  Men like Don, if that is his real name (it’s not) get around.  If you are not the kind of 60s gal who can self-assuredly buy and use prophylactics, then I suggest you stay home with your Sears and Roebuck massager.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve always loved T.V.  <em>Happy Days</em>, <em>Reading Rainbow</em>, a long line of gritty crime dramas.  I was the only kid (besides my brother) that I knew of who was allowed to watch Johnny Carson before bedtime.  “Just the monologue, then I promise I’ll go to sleep, Daddy.” 

Still, though there’s enough room in my heart for a sick amount of network, cable, HBO and Showtime programming, only a certain handful of those shows can actually shut my little ticker down and make it bleed pure joy and sadness all at once.  <em>My So-Called Life</em> (ABC, 1994-1995, may she rest in peace) is one of those heart-rending shows.

To wear with tights and dresses, of course</p></div>I’ve always loved T.V.  <em>Happy Days</em>, <em>Reading Rainbow</em>, a long line of gritty crime dramas.  I was the only kid (besides my brother) that I knew of who was allowed to watch Johnny Carson before bedtime.  “Just the monologue, then I promise I’ll go to sleep, Daddy.” </p>
<p>Still, though there’s enough room in my heart for a sick amount of network, cable, HBO and Showtime programming, only a certain handful of those shows can actually shut my little ticker down and make it bleed pure joy and sadness all at once.  <em>My So-Called Life</em> (ABC, 1994-1995, may she rest in peace) is one of those heart-rending shows.</p>
<p>Detailing the life and times of Angela Chase, a 15 year old overly-introspective, über-analytical rebel-dreamer, this show was my first TV crush.  A crush aches, throbs, yearns, kills, cleaves&mdash;it <em>crushes</em> you with the weight of how much you want/love something or someone that is just close enough to be painfully out of reach.  The perfect thing Angela (and me and every girl) wants to hear from their crush is a reciprocal expression of this love-is-pain equation: <strong>“You’re so beautiful, it hurts to look at you.”</strong> </p>
<p>Even now when I re-watch <em>My So-Called Life</em> on Hulu, huddled on my grown-up couch or in the darkened hallways of the university where I work, I ache and hunger.  It hurts to look at it.</p>
<p>If there were an angel of puberty, Angela Chase would be mine.  Patron Saint of Adolescence.  Our Lady of Perpetual Angst.  She is my sister, my self reflected back to me, the guardian of my youth.</p>
<p>Angela’s face is a pale moon that can’t control its contortions.  She can’t deny the plumpness of her cheeks when a shy smile bursts from her insides out.  She can’t soften the collapse of her features into an ugly cry when Jordan Catalano so casually stands her up and lets her down.</p>
<p>Her body slumps at odd angles.  Head cocked, feet crossed, she’s ever poised in contemplative awkwardness.   Her bobbed burgundy hair brushes her shoulders (it smells like an orange grove Brian Krakow once passed by as a child).</p>
<p>My face remembers how it always betrayed my desire to appear cool, nonchalant, powerful.  I can still taste the ball of tears welled up in my throat because I thought I was ugly or stupid, lost or alone.  The ridiculously embarrassing things I’ve said still hang in immutable bubbles above my head; haunting, they refuse to corroborate my current portrayals of confidence and control.</p>
<p>I both am Angela and long to be her.  Her boys are my boys and not.</p>

You know the one. Mysterious.  Broken.  Kinda hot. Wearing jeans from the thrift store, hair slightly rumpled and you loved the way it was “soft in the back.”  The kind of guy who could never be interested in you in one hundred years, but he was. . . sort of.  Maybe.  The kind of guy who was absolute perfection, glorious in small doses and completely missing in action for the other 98% of the time. I didn’t meet my Jordan until college.  He wore beat-up maroon retro Adidas sneakers.  Le sigh.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately for me, unlike Angela’s Jordan, mine knows how to read.  So, if he sees this, I’m so like gonna lock myself in my room and die. ) </p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<p>“Brian Krakow.”  Textbook definition?  The other guy.  *Sadface*  The one who was a little strange, a little awkward (just like you, ahem).  That boy who was always there for you, cared for you, made you skull bracelets and awesome mix tapes (like mine did) or helped you with geometry (like Angela’s version).  Poor Brian.  He’d do absolutely <em>anything</em> for you.  You don’t even know what kind of shoes he wears.</p>
<p>This love triangle drives the show.  It’s so basic and simple and real that it makes the show belong to me and every other 90s kid swathed in a bubble of flannel and angst.  It performs that tear, that rift, the essential crushing feeling between you and what you want, a chasm you only truly begin to register and recognize in adolescence.  Canceled after only one season, my favorite show will always leave me yearning and wanting, missing and needing.  Yet that lack is kind of perfect.  It’s the beautiful lack of all those firsts that can only happen one time.  It’s the lack of nostalgia&mdash;Greek for the pain and grief of coming home. </p>
<p>Watching and missing this show hurts in the best way.  That’s (so-called) life.</p>
