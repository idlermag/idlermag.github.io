										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor, writer, producer. Villain, vampire, coach. Neil Jackson has worn many faces. In America, he’s known for his performances in <em>Push</em> (2009), <em>Quantum of Solace</em> (2008), <em>Alexander</em> (2004), <em>Blade: The Series</em> and ABC’s <em>Make It or Break It</em>. His British acting resume is equally rich, including such series as <em>Heartbeat</em>, <em>Ultimate Force</em>, <em>Silent Witness</em>, <em>Dream Team</em> and the new <em>Upstairs Downstairs</em>. An active screenwriter, Jackson is also founder of the film, television and theater company Paper Dragon Productions, for which he wrote and starred in the 2007 film <em>The Passage</em>. Formerly, he was a gold-winning competitive boxer. It’s amazing that such a diverse career could belong to one man, but Neil Jackson is no ordinary man. Today, I have the pleasure of asking the multi-talented Mr. Jackson some questions about his craft, his projects, and what helps him prepare for a role.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><em>Your first American role was in Oliver Stone&#8217;s </em>Alexander<em>, correct? What made you decide to pursue acting in American productions when you already had an impressive resume in England?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="8457" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/01/11/interview-with-neil-jackson/neil-jackson-1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg" data-orig-size="299,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="neil-jackson-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=199" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=299" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="Neil Jackson" title="neil-jackson-1" width="199" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8457" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=199&amp;h=300 199w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150 100w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg 299w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /> I don&#8217;t think that the lure for me was geographical. As an actor I look for the best work, the projects that excite or resonate with me. Also, at the time, I hadn&#8217;t done a film and this was a huge production with massive stars attached and a director that I respected and admired. The fact that it was an American production wasn&#8217;t a factor in the decision making process for me.</p>
<p><em>For a little while, you seemed to be playing a lot of villains. Did you ever feel typecast as a &#8220;bad guy&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>No, I&#8217;ve never felt typecast playing a villain, though I did start to wonder what it was about me that made me seem more antagonist than protagonist. That has since changed, but I still relish the opportunity to play the &#8220;baddie.&#8221; Their parameters are less defined, meaning that the scope for range in a villain is broader. They live and exist outside of the heroes world and this can be reflected in the performance, which is a lot of fun.</p>
<p><em>What kind of physical preparation do you have to do for your more action-heavy roles, like those in </em>Blade: The Series<em>, </em>Quantum of Solace<em> and </em>Push<em>?</em></p>
<p>I train a lot on an every day basis. My belief is that it is easier to stay ready than to get ready, so as long as I maintain a good physical fitness I am always prepared for whatever challenges a role may present. Then, for each individual role, I approach the necessities specific to that character. For <em>Blade</em>, the moment I got the role I started training with a teacher in samurai swords. There was no fight for my character in the scripts as yet, but I knew eventually Blade and Marcus would fight and I wanted to be prepared and to be Blade&#8217;s equal in combat. I worked every day with the sword for three months until it came [time] for the final battle scene. And when it came I was ready.</p>
<p><em>Your current role as Sasha Belov on ABC&#8217;s </em>Make It Or Break It<em> isn&#8217;t an action-heavy one, but is still centered around sport. Was your past as a gold-winning competitive boxer helpful in preparing for this character?</em></p>
<p>I think that having an athlete mentality has been really helpful for me as an actor in every sense. I prepare for roles and auditions in the same (psychological) way that I would for fights when I was boxing. Discipline, focus, commitment, hard work.</p>
<p><em>Do you have a preference between acting in television or film, or does it just depend on the role?</em></p>
<p>It all depends on the role, the project and the other people involved (director, producers, cast).</p>
<p><em>In the nineties, before you began acting professionally, you wrote your own musical. You returned to writing in 2006 and 2007, writing the screenplays for the films </em>The Passage<em> and </em>Star Crossed<em>. Are we going to see more writing from you in the future?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="8459" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/01/11/interview-with-neil-jackson/neil-jackson-3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg" data-orig-size="450,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="neil-jackson-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=450" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="Neil Jackson" title="neil-jackson-3" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8459" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> I have been writing for eleven years now and, though the two films you mention are the first to be produced, I have three projects in development now and very much hope to see them get financing in the next calendar year.</p>
<p><em>Your London production company Paper Dragon Productions opened up American offices in Los Angeles just last year. What is the focus of the company?</em></p>
<p>The focus of the company is to make good films that we are passionate about and to facilitate creative artists to get their voice heard.</p>
<p><em>I noticed that Paper Dragon Productions was also involved in the launch of the new London Repertory Company. Is theater something that&#8217;s still close to your heart?</em></p>
<p>I was trained in theatre and my first jobs as an actor were in theatre. It is very close to my heart.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently acting in the second series of <em>Upstairs Downstairs</em> for the BBC.</p>
<p><em>Any &#8220;dream projects&#8221; that you&#8217;d love to do as an actor or writer, or as both?</em></p>
<p>Every project is a dream project.  Dreams change.</p>
