										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 30th marked my last day working at the bookstore. Now I’m just preparing for baby and trying to work on editing my novel between naps. There are a lot of naps.</p>
<p>My first visit to the bookstore was the day after my last day. I had a huge stack of books to buy and had saved my pennies and sold some books I no longer wanted. Plus I missed everyone already and needed to see their faces. I also missed the stacks of books and all the shelves lined with stories I hadn’t read yet. Bookstores have always been a magical place where I could lose myself for hours just thinking of all the books I wanted to take home. Bookstores smell nice and the staff is smart. I was truly proud to be a part of my store’s 30 year anniversary party this fall. It’s become an impressive thing to have an independent store last that long in the book business.</p>
<p>Now it’s been nine days since my last day, 23 by the time this gets posted, and I feel like I’m floundering a little. I don’t know what the new releases are. I don’t know what new author Amanda is in love with or how far Dylan is in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (<em>Game of Thrones</em>) series. I don’t know the latest crazy customer story from Sue or how many times Allison has been hit on while shelving science fiction. Maybe she doesn’t even shelve that section anymore. I can’t confidently point out the location of the large-print section, it moves about five times a year, never settling into a true home. I haven’t seen Donna’s beautiful fall books display and I have no idea what new humor or fiction books are showcased at the register. I know I could drive there and find out, but I used to just know. I spent hours absorbing books and now that’s over.</p>
<p>A quick look at most of my bookshelves at home can remind me that I have plenty of books here that I haven’t read yet. Much to the chagrin of my ex-coworkers I do not shelve my personal collection in alphabetical order. Some shelves contain only my favorites. One shelf was all science fiction but now it has plays and a couple classics thrown in. Mostly I want the books to look pretty. Yes, they are for reading, but one of the reasons I don’t simply download books onto my iPad is because I like the way they look on a shelf. And stacked on tables. And lined across the mantle. And sometimes left to sit in bags for a week because I don’t have room for the new batch. </p>
<p>It’s still difficult not to buy new ones. I won’t have the daily temptation of beautiful covers or intriguing titles but I’ll also have less money to spend on books. I know I’ll still look through the used books and the sale books every time I visit the bookstore. I need to keep up-to-date on new books coming out. I had to find out that Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biography came out through <em>The Daily Show</em> like a commoner instead of seeing it on a cart in the back room a week ahead of time. I’ll have to follow through on my cousin Elizabeth’s suggestion and start visiting my library too. Although there can be a wait to borrow the most popular titles it is cheaper, so long as I can remember to return the books on time, not something I’m great at.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in which I’m huge and don’t really want to leave the house, I need to remember that I haven’t read at least half of the books in my own home. Maybe that sounds odd to you, but working in a bookstore for three years gives you a lot of opportunities to buy books. All of my personal spending money went to books and coffee for those three years. I have at least a hundred receipts for books filed away. I have galley copies from authors I had never heard of before taking the book home because maybe someday I might want to read it. Free books are hard to pass up. I have my husband’s science books that I made him buy with his own money but that I plan on reading too. And now we have kids books added to the mix. The baby needs his own bookcase and he isn’t even born yet. </p>
<p>Maybe this winter while it’s bitterly cold and I don’t want to leave the house, I’ll start at the top of one bookcase and read every book on that shelf, working my way through the entire collection. Then I’ll know what I want to keep and what I want to sell come spring. When warmer weather arrives I can unload the old at our used book counter, pick out a whole new stack to take home and line up prettily until I have time to read again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A week or so ago I had a customer selling books at the used book counter. She had about a dozen mass market romances and a Jodi Picoult hardcover. Usually I don’t remember these details, but this customer stood out.</p>
<p>After I took her name and other information and gave her the wait time she struck up a conversation with another customer who was browsing books.  They spoke about how nice the used books section was and I glowed a little bit. I was working and didn’t really see any need to take part in their conversation, but I am a huge eavesdropper and they were standing about three feet in front of my workstation.</p>
<p>After the general niceties were shared, the conversation took a quick turn. Both customers were women, I’d say the one selling her books was in her 40s and the woman browsing was approaching 60. I’m not great at ages (or height or weight, I make a terrible witness, please don’t rob me) but that’s my best guess. I don’t quite remember how they got to this point, but they began discussing how neither of them re-read books. That’s why the seller was there, she had read all her romances and her Jodi Picoult and wanted to trade them in for credit to buy new books. Which is all well and good. I continued working, thinking a little bit about exactly how many times I’ve read my favorite book, but keeping quiet.</p>
<p>The browser mentioned that she never re-read books either. Two single-time-only readers! She also never re-watched movies, after all she “knew exactly what would happen.” I had to interject.</p>
<p>“Never? You never re-watch a movie you liked?”</p>
<p>“Oh no! It’s a waste of time. My grandsons re-watch movies all the time. I don’t understand it.”</p>
<p>Then the seller chimed in, “I don’t re-watch movies either,” she shared a conspiratorial look with the other customer. “It must be a generational thing.”</p>
<p>Now I was pretty sure at this point that these women were not of my generation, but they certainly weren’t of each other’s either. I half expected one of them to say they never re-read books because when they lived through the Great Depression they had to keep reading the only book the family owned and they never wanted to do that again. (I’m also not good with historical timelines.)</p>
<p>At this point the woman browsing books moved further into the section and the women selling her books was left with only me to talk to. Granted she could just come back to check on her books at the time I had given her, but she didn’t.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s stupid. It’s stupid to re-read a book.”</p>
<p>I was surprised at her change in tone. Before it was just something that these two women didn’t do. Now it was stupid?</p>
<p>“I like to re-read a good book,” I said. “Sure, you know how it ends, but if the characters and the writing are good, it’s fun to experience it again.”</p>
<p>“No. It’s stupid. I like sequels if I like the characters.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t want to spend time with the story again? Re-reading a book is like comfort food.” That got me a glare.</p>
<p>“It’s stupid. It’s a stupid thing to do.”</p>
<p>At this point I was out. While it’s not directly outlined in the employee handbook, I’m pretty sure “don’t tell customers that they are in fact the one who is stupid” is some sort of company policy.</p>
<p>The woman kept talking for a little bit, but I was out of the conversation. I don’t really have the ability to bite my tongue and say something nice. I just have to shut up. But after the fact with you, dear readers, I have a little more freedom.</p>
<p>Really, lady!? You know when you say something a person does is stupid enough you start to call that person stupid. And never is a strong word. I said I would never read one of the stupid romances you brought in, but I’ve read two so far and they weren’t as bad as I had kind of hoped they would be. Never re-read a book? That’s like never getting pepperoni pizza again because you did it once.</p>
<p>And maybe, just maybe, if you had better taste in books you might want to re-read them. Sure, in most of yours there’s a lot of flirting, a dirty scene and then a marriage. In Dickens you get more the second time around. </p>
<p>In summation, you don’t have to re-read anything. Just don’t call something you obviously don’t understand stupid fourteen times in one conversation. And get some better taste.</p>

I finally accepted Boston as my home. I climbed a mountain. I ate octopus. I fell deeply in love with John Steinbeck. His words soothed me during the hottest of July days like a cool stream in the Michigan wilderness. His discussion of sin in <em>East of Eden</em> even has me pondering a pretentious literary tattoo. </p>
<p>This summer saw the fall of a giant, an institution, that truth be told had been teetering for quite some time. And I’m not talking about Arnold, or Bin Laden, or Justin Beiber’s hair. </p>
<p>I’m talking about the fall of Borders. The emptying of bookshelves is about the saddest thing I can think of. It hurts the very part of my heart that houses all I hold dear, like my mother, and cranberry sauce, and moccasins. </p>
<p>Your fancy book learnin’ ways are being threatened, dear friends. On less chain means countless fewer author readings, less promotion of new voices, fewer books available to browse and buy and read and love in less affluent, out-of-the-way places. </p>
<p>With the closing of Shaman Drum and the Borders flagship store, Ann Arbor has rendered itself nearly useless when it comes to book shopping. Though the best of us know that Schuler Books in East Lansing has always been where it’s at. </p>
<p>This past weekend I took my first pilgrimage to the book lover’s mecca. If you don’t know that I’m talking about Strand in NYC I suggest you do your research immediately before you go on declaring yourself a bibliophile. </p>
<p>Established in 1927 on Fourth Avenue, Strand was at one time a part of New York’s Book Row. Book Row was a series of 48 bookstores started in the 1890’s that ran from Union Square to Astor Place. Or as I like to think of it: heaven. </p>
<p>Strand is famous for a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>18 miles of books (for reals)</li>
<li>used, rare, and out of print editions (beyond your wildest dreams) and</li>
<li>independent ownership.</li>
</ol>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6429" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6429" data-attachment-id="6429" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/04/to-the-mattresses/strand/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/strand.jpg" data-orig-size="472,324" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="strand" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/strand.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/strand.jpg?w=472" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/strand.jpg?w=300&#038;h=205" alt="Strand stacks" title="strand" width="300" height="205" class="size-medium wp-image-6429" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/strand.jpg?w=300&amp;h=205 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/strand.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/strand.jpg 472w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6429" class="wp-caption-text">18 miles. No joke.</p></div> The past few years has borne witness to an interesting phenomenon: the triumph of select indie bookstores. While indies can’t offer huge price cuts, they do offer a quality of service and a customer experience that was never successfully reproduced by chain stores. With good service comes a brand of loyalty that no rewards card can replace. But not all indies have been successful by any means.</p>
<p>Shopping at an independent bookstore when cheaper options like Amazon are available usually indicates that the patrons are affluent. Also, they value education and local businesses and put their money where their support is. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, books are a recreational good, not strictly necessary for survival, though you could argue for hours on all the ways they nourish. Shopping at independent book stores is a certain type of socioeconomic privilege often not acknowledged. Indies do best in upper-middle-class neighborhoods where education is king. Ann Arbor (home to U of M), East Lansing (home to MSU), Grand Rapids (home to Grand Valley State University). Here in Boston, indies are currently flourishing in Brookline (the only city in the world capable of producing Conan O’Brien) and Cambridge (Harvard). It’s no mystery why Strand thrives in a place like New York City. Count all the colleges within city limits and you’ll have your simple solution. </p>
<p>No matter your feelings on corporations are,  it’s a sad day to see a bookstore fold. The simple equation is this: Fewer bookstores=fewer books. </p>
<p>Sometimes life plays out like an anti-<em>You’ve Got Mail</em>. FOX books has fallen. Shop Around the Corner though, well, she’s ready to go the the mattresses. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent a number of years working in a bookstore in the early 00s, starting shortly after the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> in 2000. For a character who has appeared in books, films, toys, stickers, a theme park, and who knows what else, it&#8217;s always amusing for me to remember that at the time there was no merchandise at all. As the bookstore industry even then was moving to include more of what was called &#8220;sidelines&#8221; on the sales floor, this disposed us to look on the Harry Potter books fondly and J. K. Rowling as one of us: A book person. We relished the stories of Jo, a single mother, writing <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> in a coffee shop. We thought of all the money even then that she was turning down by not selling stuffed owls, or plastic broomsticks.</p>

I don&#8217;t remember all the details, because I tried not to pay attention, but I&#8217;m sure there were Harry Potter Happy Meals as well as the coloring books, posters, picture books, and other movie tie-ins that took over my bookstore. It was the end of a particular innocence that we as bookstore people should probably never have lulled ourselves into. Jo was still clearly a wonderful writer, but she wasn&#8217;t just a book person. She wasn&#8217;t one of <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>And you know what? None of that matters. The books, the films, the fan art and fiction, all of it is worth every cheap piece of plastic sold with a Harry Potter logo. Harry Potter is <em>better</em> as something more than a book.</p>
<p>I make this assertion with some confidence, having read all the books (I started late, but I caught up fast), seen all the films (except the last one &#8212; I&#8217;ll get there), and having spent more time buried in Harry Potter lexicons, fan-written stories, and Wikipedia entries than I care to admit.</p>
<p>Which brings me to a rather odd admission: There have been a host of Harry Potter video games &#8212; at least one for every film, and even a <em>Quidditch World Cup</em> game in 2003 &#8212; and <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> is the only one I&#8217;ve ever played. (You can read my final word on that game <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/">here</a>, in case you missed it.) As much as I love Harry Potter, I avoid Harry Potter video games like the plague because movie tie-in video games are almost universally terrible.</p>

Adaptations should strengthen great characters and storylines. The plain fact of getting to encounter a character and story in a new form, not to mention all the little (or big) tweaks and changes necessary to make a story work in a different medium all <em>add</em> something to the greater whole. The book changes the way we see the film, and the film changes the way we read the book. Even running around on a cheap plastic broom changes the way we think about a Quidditch match, at least a little bit.</p>
<p>Video games should be a full-fledged part of this cross-media narrative exchange, and the only reason that they are not is that they are produced quickly and rushed to market, almost always constrained by the aesthetic and narrative determinations of the film they rehash. Even thinking of a game as an adaptation in its own right, rather than a marketing and merchandising tool, would be a huge step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Even better would be a game that tells a story of its own, in the universe suggested by but not limited to that created by a book or a film. There are plenty of good examples of this, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_Game" target="_blank">the 1998 <em>X-Files</em> PC game</a>, to the recent <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Shattered_Dimensions" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Edge_of_Time" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Edge of Time</a></em> games. (And, of course, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum" target="_blank">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>.) The best adaptations tell their own stories, and the Harry Potter theme park in Orlando proves every day that there are large numbers of people who would leap at the opportunity to live in Harry Potter&#8217;s world for a while (or longer than a while).</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to make a suggestion. Who knows? The internet is a big place. Maybe, just maybe, word will get back to Jo herself. We need a new Harry Potter video game. Not one that revisits all the films in one 100+ hour multi-disc game. Not even a Harry Potter MMORPG. (Which would probably sell like gangbusters, and might even be cool, but it&#8217;s a little too obvious a place to start.) No, what I want is a game based solely on the Battle of Hogwarts and the preceding year at the school, maybe from Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley&#8217;s point of view. I want the story that we didn&#8217;t get in the book <em>or</em> the film. I want to get to flesh out two great characters who do really important things even though we don&#8217;t see that much of them while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out camping. I want to direct the defense of the school. I want to cut off Nagini&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>You could probably even sell some controllers shaped like Godric Gryffindor&#8217;s sword. It would be worth it.</p>
