										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The editors of <em>The Idler</em> are a shadowy, self-effacing crew. But to help celebrate the site&#8217;s birthday, they put together a list (in no particular order) of some of their favorite pieces from <em>The Idler</em>&#8216;s most frequent columnists. It&#8217;s been an amazing first year, and they claim to be very much looking forward to the second year, so long as it doesn&#8217;t involve actually doing too much of anything.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong></p>
<p>Of all our wonderful <em>Idler</em> writers, I think Jill’s the one who hit her stride the most quickly and consistently. With her cooking pieces she invited you into her kitchen, equally as excited to share her failures as she was her successes. But for me she really nailed it with her <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/04/18/liquid-indulgence-a-personal-history-of-drinking/">&#8220;Liquid indulgence&#8221;</a> piece, which stepped a little bit outside of that comfortable groove to share the kind of funny, personal story that makes you want to hang out in that kitchen in the first place. <em>&#8211;KM</em> </p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong></p>
<p>This was a tough one for me. Mike’s got a couple of really great pieces about fostering a relationship with his son through music that really stuck with me. But in the end I had to go with <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/06/27/u2-in-east-lansing-before-and-after/">&#8220;U2 in East Lansing (before and after)&#8221;</a> because I think it epitomizes what makes Mike such a great <em>Idler</em> contributor: Pure passion. If you missed this show, Mike’s piece is about as close as you can get to real thing. <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p><strong>Angela Vasquez-Giroux</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to not start each of these paragraphs with the words &#8220;this is my favorite writer,&#8221; but Angela Vasquez-Giroux was exactly the sort of person I had in mind when <em>The Idler</em> got started, and we were lucky to get her. She&#8217;s a passionate baseball fan with a deep and intimate knowledge of the game, and she will never, ever simply give me summary of last night&#8217;s game. She may give me a poem about listening to a game with her grandfather, complain about Fox&#8217;s truly atrocious baseball broadcasts, call Jeter out for being a cheater, or when I&#8217;m lucky, do all of these things at once. My favorite piece of Angela&#8217;s however, has to be <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/14/doing-everything-you-do-in-a-skirt-or-some-thoughts-on-being-a-girl-doing-boy-things/">&#8220;Doing everything you do, in a skirt, or, Some thoughts on being a girl, doing boy things,&#8221;</a> because not only does Angela know more about baseball than you, and love the game more than you do, she&#8217;ll outrun, out throw, and outhit you, all while wearing a skirt. Softball, after all, is just baseball &#8220;with bigger balls.&#8221; Damn right. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>
<p><strong>Ana Holguin</strong></p>
<p>One of <em>The Idler</em>’s strengths lies in offering unique perspectives on common topics. I think we really hit it out of the park when that unique perspective gets an origin story. Ana’s &#8220;PopHeart&#8221; column has covered many topics that often cross paths with one another, but I never expected to read anything like <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/05/25/the-macho-man-vs-the-family-secrets/">&#8220;The Macho Man vs. the family secrets&#8221;</a> which links former WWF superstar Randy “Macho Man” Savage with escapism from childhood trauma. Even less expected was how touching it turned out to be.  <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p><strong>Kate Sloan</strong></p>
<p>Editing <em>The Idler</em> is usually one of the cushiest jobs around (which is good, because the pay sucks). Every once in a while a writer and I will send ideas back and forth, or I&#8217;ll give a gentle nudge with a possible suggestion when someone is coming up on a deadline (or has watched one go by), but normally I just get to sit back and click the &#8220;publish&#8221; button. Kate Sloan&#8217;s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/03/gaying-up-gotham/">&#8220;Gaying up Gotham&#8221;</a> was a rare exception to this, where after talking about a couple of ideas, Kate sent me a short draft of a piece about the homoerotic undertones between Two-Face and the Batman in Frank Miller&#8217;s <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>. I sent a short note to Kate that said something like, &#8220;You CANNOT write about homosexuality in <em>The Dark Knight</em> without writing about the Joker.&#8221; Kate wrote back to say something like &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re probably right,&#8221; and her second draft knocked it out of the park. It&#8217;s still one of the smartest things we&#8217;ve run. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong></p>
<p>I have always found religion to be fascinating, especially in social context. In <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/03/02/non-catholic-catholicism-jesus-christ-superstar/">&#8220;Non-Catholic Catholicism: <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i>,&#8221;</a> Rosemary discusses one of the few (maybe the only?) successful pop culture/ Catholic cross-overs, and why it works so well (admitting that some of its success has a little to do with Jesus and the apostles&#8217; hot factor).  <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Simone</strong></p>
<p>I desperately want to know where Andrew Simone finds the games that he writes about, and the second most important reason I read him is that I haven&#8217;t figured it out yet. The <em>most</em> important reason I read (and share) Andrew&#8217;s writing is that he&#8217;s incredibly in touch with the ways that form and content work together (or don&#8217;t) in video games, particularly independent PC and browser games. One of the best examples of Andrew&#8217;s keen sensibility can be found in his review of the <em>Octodad</em> game, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/16/a-day-in-the-life/">&#8220;A Day in the Life.&#8221;</a> It&#8217;s a unique and clever game, but Andrew really gets to the heart of it by observing that the player&#8217;s clumsy control of the Octodad character is actually the central feature of the game itself. Being an octopus pretending to be a human is <em>hard</em>, and Octodad (and Andrew) get it exactly right. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong></p>
<p>Kevin Mattison has written a number of strong pieces, and he&#8217;s right up there in the group of people who have done the most writing for the site (so it feels almost like a crime to pick just one piece), but the column I keep coming back to is the one where he surprised me. I&#8217;ve known Kevin for a long time, and watched a lot of movies with him, but &#8220;The madness of Klaus Kinski&#8221; felt like a bolt out of the blue. I had never heard of Kinski, much less ever seen any of his work, but using Werner Herzog&#8217;s documentary <em>My Best Fiend Klaus Kinski</em> as a jumping-off point, Kevin quickly but thoroughly introduces the life and career of this troubled but brilliant man. It wasn&#8217;t until I watched the trailer for Kinski&#8217;s <em>Nosferatu the Vampyre</em> that I realized that I&#8217;d been staring at his face on a poster in Kevin&#8217;s basement for years. I get a little bit of something like that from nearly everything that Kevin writes. <em>&#8211;GC</em></p>
<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong></p>
<p>I’ve known my co-editor for quite some time now, and he’s always had a gift for finding significance in the seemingly insignificant. Knowing this, I was excited to read his video game column, as I was sure it would offer some unique insight into a medium often struggling for legitimacy. He hasn’t disappointed. And being the former roommate mentioned in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/28/1410/">&#8220;The horror before words,&#8221;</a> it was impossible for me to not pick it. Plus, it contains the line, “the difference between fear and horror is the difference between being killed and being eaten.” ‘nuff said. <em>&#8211;KM</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>We owe a great deal of gratitude to all our writers. We may complain about the editor pay, but the contributor pay is just as bad. Your creativity, idiosyncrasies, and keystrokes make <em>The Idler</em> what it is, word by word, idea by idea.</p>

I had <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/30/what-was-your-favorite-music-of-2010/">a snippet column where I gave some hints</a> and I have talked about <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/08/white-sky/">three</a> of <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/15/on-my-way/">those</a> <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/22/chemical-dependence/">four</a> releases. But as I approach the fourth mix I do need to let you all in on a little secret. In my teaser list I mentioned a CD that came attatched to a magazine. I’m gonna write about that release but I must admit that I did now know that this disc came with a magazine or vice versa. No, I didn’t buy a magazine to get the music, I downloaded it. Online. For free. There. I said it. Come and get me FBI!</p>
<p>In all seriousness I bumped into the mix commissioned to accompany the July issue of <em>Mixmag</em>, the venerable UK magazine devoted to club culture. The mix was by Fatboy Slim, an old favorite of mine. Much like with the Chemical Brothers (whom I wrote about last week) I had used to absolutely love him but he slowly got less interesting to me. The reliance on vocalists is really what did it.  I guess in my heart I just love the dance music that isn’t too reliant on vocals, I prefer there to be snippets of words of phrases that set and encourage a mood. </p>
<p>The mix is titled <em>The Legend Returns</em>. Clocks in at just under an hour. Fifty one minutes. Goddamn is it great. When I listen to it I think about the people who clam DJs aren’t &#8220;musicians&#8221; due to the fact that DJs don’t make their own music.  I think that this is the biggest misconception about DJs: They don’t make their own music, but depend on the creations of others to make their living. There is some truth to this but the way a proper, talented DJ uses the music of others is what makes their art individual and their own. They are using the songs, the art of others, as their instruments. They use those instruments to make a cohesive whole and in a live setting they alter and vary them to generate a response in the crowd.</p>
<p>I spent many a Friday with a friend of mine who was a club DJ. It isn’t simply playing a few CDs in a row and setting a mood. It is much more intensive. You listen, you read the crowd, you make sure that the music flows together, is the right tempo, is something that you control to get the crowd into the music. It is something that takes true skill.</p>
<p>Now I saw Fatboy Slim in the late 90s, at Clutch Cargo&#8217;s in Pontiac, Michigan. The show was tremendous, watching the crowd was tremendous. The old church turned into a giant throbbing mass of sexual energy and intense vigor. I remember a lot about that night that had nothing to do with the music being played. </p>
<p>Back to the mix. I think I discovered it over the late summer when I stumbled into the <a target="new" href="http://fatboyslim.net/">Fatboy Slim website</a>. There was a new song released by Mr. Slim (“Machine Can Do The Work”)  that I had listened to then downloaded. The song touched on the old spark, great to run to and enjoy overall. Then I found the mix. </p>
<p>I have many Fatboy Slim mixes, some I bought on CD, some I downloaded off Napster 10 years ago. (Really.) This is one of the best I have heard, maybe because all the music is so fresh, things I hadn’t heard prior to listening. Like with other mixes I sought out a few tracks to purchase to enjoy outside of the mix. Then as I surfed back over to the Fatboy Slim website I discovered that he lists charts of the music he plays on the website Beatport AND offers up FREE mixes on his website. I’ve downloaded all three and while some of them are a bit short (around 30 minutes) they just kick ass and make me feel that thrill, that tingle up the leg, that I felt back in the mid-90s when I first got into his music. And in the time when I feel old, like ancient sand, hearing this music livens me up and makes me feel. . . alive? I don’t feel relevant, I don’t feel a connection to anything outside of my day-to-day life. I feel more and more like I wasted so many years, thousands of days and thousands of hours and somehow listening to this music, while it does bring up the feeling of waste in life, does make me smile, make me want to dance and makes me want to keep at things. See, Fatboy Slim is in his mid-to-late 40s. Different circumstances, sure, but turning a certain age is only as damaging as what you do with it. I’m trying to not feel 100 years old. This music makes me feel my age, in a good way, and reminds me through its effortlessness and its fun energy that you really are in control of your own feelings, and you really are as old as you allow yourself to be.</p>

Released June 22, 2010</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember where I first heard their music, but I can remember where I first heard about their music. It was in a year end issue of the <em>NME</em> in 1996. It was actually the year-end issue for 1995 and there was the standard year-end review of the 50 best records. I remember there being a ton of great records that came out in 1995. This probably was the beginning of my ear listening to the sounds coming from across the Atlantic rather than on our shores.  I think <em>Exit Planet Dust</em> was the 22nd &#8220;best&#8221; record of the year. The gap between reading this and actually having the disc is of an unknown length. What I do remember is ordering it for the store as a &#8216;B&#8217; Title and hard-selling the disc. Probably sold two, three copies a week. When I moved to another store I continued to push it, buying all their associated releases, all the while playing and hard-selling the disc. Eventually it entered the &#8216;A&#8217; System; I credit my hard-selling. I called the label, I may have even emailed or called them, and got mainlined into the promo network. The greatest coup was scoring a copy of the awsome dj mix called the <em>Anti-Nazi Mix</em>. It was great. Their next two CDs were greater and greater. Their fourth disc was a grower but my ears were changing. Their fifth disc I think I have, their sixth disc I don&#8217;t. They lost me, as happens with many artists we fall for. Sometimes the band gets boring. Sometimes your tastes change. The Chems got boring, relying on what felt like a myriad of vocalists. where previous discs had the occasional singing these later discs had too much.</p>
<p>I happened upon a new song, on YouTube&mdash;like you do nowadays&mdash;titled <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GqRsmffeVI">&#8220;Escape Velocity.&#8221;</a> It was eleven minutes long. I clicked the link. It was GREAT. I listened to it again and again and again until it was pulled that evening. I found a soft sounding live version and a radio rip. I ran to it, found it again on YouTube, played it again and again. With each play came a fear that the song would kill the rest of CD. It didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By the time I got a promo of the CD I had listened to an online stream of the album on NPR&#8217;s web site. I listened while working and retained very little. When I got the CD and could listen in the car, only then did I play the disc repeatedly and found that it contained many strong tracks. Granted, I kept coming back to &#8220;Escape Velocity,&#8221; but there are songs just as great found on the CD. &#8220;K+R+W&#8221; is my favorite, a real pinnacle of their career in my eyes. It feels like a song but still a dancer song. It shimmers and smiles. I love it. And I love the disc. Would it have been stronger with the two iTunes exclusive tracks (&#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop&#8221; and &#8220;Pourqoui&#8221;)? Probably not. I love both of those songs too, but they just wouldn&#8217;t have fit in my mind.</p>
<p>Listening to the disc and loving it soade me feel both old and new, young and old. I know I can&#8217;t feel both but sometime I do.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/30/what-was-your-favorite-music-of-2010/">Clue</a>: one of the short films accompanying the songs gave this album its cover, that of a woman seemingly underwater)</p>

Released January 18, 2010</p>
<p>I love comedy records. Always have. <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/11/20/thats-not-funny/">Wrote about them a few months ago.</a> I love finding something new, something that makes me laugh out loud, something that just brings joy like a good comedy record does. This is one of those CDs. </p>
<p>I have been familiar with Aziz Ansari’s face for some time and in the weeks leading up to the Comedy Central debut of this special I saw a video clip on Ansari on Jimmy Kimmel talking about seeing a band, Major Lazer, that I liked. The clip was great and on a whim I downloaded the LP from iTunes in advance of a trip to Los Angeles. I spent the entire trip listening to the jokes and laughing, laughing, laughing over and over again.</p>
<p>There are aspects that I find compelling on the disc, the first being the atmosphere of the room. Great comedy records cannot be recorded in large concert halls. They work the best in a small room where you can hear the audience, hear the individual laughs as they ebb and flow across the performance. This record has that, a smallish room where you can differentiate the laughs of the people and tell what jokes really pop the crowd.</p>
<p>The next aspect of this that I find appealing is the common sense of interests. Kayne West, Jay Z, TV on the Radio, the names dropped on the disc are recent, relevant, part of something that people who like music know. I like the sense of intelligence behind the words. There is a concise aspect to this performance that really makes me think of hearing Eddie Izzard for the first time. While the jokes of Ansari don’t flip and dovetail into each other like Izzard’s best work (by the way, Izzard’s CDs are probably the only ones recorded in larger rooms that really are tremendous works of art), each bit feels individual and intelligent and hilarious.</p>
<p>I guess, at the end of the day, what appeals to me is the laughter. I laughed when I heard this for the first time. I laughed listening to the disc while I was writing this piece. I dropped his bit about Kanye West onto my iPod right before Kanye’s latest song. It works, works well. Comedy records should make you laugh regardless of what the comedian is saying or how they are saying it. This record touched on things I am familiar with and did so in a fashion that left me doing nothing but laughing and hoping that the new material we hear from Ansari is just as funny as his debut.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/30/what-was-your-favorite-music-of-2010/">Clue</a>: The cover of the CD shows Mr. Ansari dressed for a night out standing in front of a big brown bear)</p>

Released January 11, 2010.</p>
<p>I’ll admit it. Had I seen this band prior to hearing them I probably wouldn’t have given them a chance. Silly, I know. Even as I began to want the first record by Vampire Weekend I was slightly off put by their discography, background and, yes, their look. Thankfully the music that I heard pulled me in. Theirs was a debut CD as good as any, still sounding fresh two years after its released. Their first, self-titled LP was like a musical sugar drop you placed on your tongue. Letting it slowly dissolve, you appreciated what you had and when it was gone you wanted another. </p>
<p>Flash-forward one year and the band released their second CD, <em>Contra</em>.  I’ve been through this before. Fantastic debut, naff second attempt. Maybe in the time between releases your ears changed; the styles you heard were no longer ones that interested you. Perhaps your initial interest was a fad. Prior to the release of this LP I read a long profile in <em>The New Yorker</em> about the band. I liked the piece but didn’t buy the CD for a few weeks. Then I did. An dang if I didn’t play it over and over and over. </p>
<p>Generally when you obsess on a disc you listen listen listen and the stronger songs rise to the top, like the cream in fresh milk. Some songs you don’t like at first but then they come to you. For me there are only two songs on this disc that didn’t stick with me at once, and they came back to back. Now I really enjoy the songs. </p>
<p>The album is brief but lovely and for me it conjures up feelings of culture, interest and a pursuit of leisure that operates on a higher plane than the usual pursuits. This record, and the previous record, makes me want to send my children to school at Columbia in NYC. This is not simply due to the college’s placement in the first <em>Ghostbusters</em> film, but due to this band. See, these four upper class boys met at Columbia. And when I think of my children I think about them wanting to experience their formative and wonderful college years in a city with so much to offer, where everything, every genre is to be embraced and not rejected. A free atmosphere where the individual is allowed to make their own path through whatever artistic forest they want. </p>
<p>For me this CD contains many little moments that fill into a greater whole: the vibes and churn of &#8220;Horchata,&#8221; the high pitched chorus in &#8220;White Sky,&#8221; the sentiment and guitar of &#8220;Holiday,&#8221; the breathlessness of &#8220;California English,&#8221; the understated piano on &#8220;Taxi Cab,&#8221; the sequencing on &#8220;Run,&#8221; the downward roll of &#8220;Cousins,&#8221; that friggin &#8220;Giving Up The Gun&#8221; video, the cha cha chat sample of &#8220;Diplomat’s Son,&#8221; and the bareness of &#8220;I Think Ur A Contra.&#8221; Ten songs, ten songs that you want to hear again and again. Truly a magnificent disc. </p>
<p>(Now <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/30/what-was-your-favorite-music-of-2010/">my clue from last week</a> refers to the cover model for this release. Seems she signed a release form during her modeling days and has seen her image all over the globe promoting items with her face. This resulted in her not being paid.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Netflix instant viewing has been both a blessing and a curse for an indecisive movie fan like me. Finally the video store has come to your living room and I, for one, am a bit overwhelmed. Sometimes, I’ll lose a whole hour of my life to aimlessly scanning the catalogue finding myself attracted to so many movies of so many genres, that I don’t know what to pick. I’ve seen some interesting things via instant viewing in the last year, some old and some new. Below is a list of the five most interesting flicks I saw via Netflix in 2010. Here’s hoping that 2011 yields some similar finds.</p>
<ul>
<li><img data-attachment-id="2862" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/07/the-netflix-b-list/yakuza_ver3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg" data-orig-size="499,755" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="yakuza_ver3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=198" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=499" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150" alt="Yakuza" title="yakuza_ver3" width="99" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2862" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/yakuza_ver3.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300 198w" sizes="(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px" /> <em>The Yakuza</em> (1975)
<p>Michigan’s own Paul Schrader set a Hollywood record by selling the script for this neo-noir for a cool $325,000, a record at the time. Tough guy Robert Mitchum plays Harry Kilmer, a retired detective who heads to Japan to rescue the daughter of an old friend, who has gotten caught up in the Yakuza aka the Japanese Mafia. This is a tough flick that features some pretty heavy and complex themes but doesn’t skimp on the action. The finale featuring Mitchum storming a dojo full of sword-wielding henchmen with a shotgun in one hand and a revolver in the other is the stuff that pulp fiction is made of.</li>

<p>From the makers of that <em>Watership Down</em> cartoon that creeped you out as a kid, comes another weighty and disturbing animated film about the politics of the animal kingdom.  Rowf and Snitter are two dogs who escape from an animal research facility only to find themselves not only ill-prepared and shell-shocked by the realities of nature but hunted by their former captors as well. This is a film that opens with a dog drowning during some macabre experiment so that sets the tone right there. As depressing as it is, <em>The Plague Dogs</em> is an emotional and fascinating movie. It’s interesting to see animation used to tell a truly adult story (and not in a Ralph Bakshi adult way). The sullen voice work by the likes of John Hurt only adds to the somber tone. Be sure to give your dog a couple of extra hugs after watching this one.</li>

<p>Have you heard of this before? I can’t say I truly <em>recommend</em> this movie, but you have to see it!</p>
<p>John Boorman followed up his <em>Deliverance</em> (1972) success with this bizarre and off-putting sci-fi flick. In the post-apocalyptic future (of course), life is fairly primitive and Zardoz, a large stone head that floats through the air, preaches his own updated gospel, which goes a little something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2865" style="width: 133px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2865" data-attachment-id="2865" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/07/the-netflix-b-list/zardoz-2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg" data-orig-size="496,603" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="zardoz-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=247" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=496" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=123&#038;h=150" alt="Sean Connery" title="zardoz-2" width="123" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2865" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=123&amp;h=150 123w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/zardoz-2.jpg?w=246&amp;h=300 246w" sizes="(max-width: 123px) 100vw, 123px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2865" class="wp-caption-text">You know you want to click and see the full-size image</p></div> The gun is good. The penis is evil. The penis shoots seeds, and makes new life to poison the Earth with a plague of men, as once it was, but the gun shoots death, and purifies the Earth of the filth of brutals. Go forth . . . and kill!</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, Sean Connery runs around the whole film in a red diaper and a ponytail and the film gets more and more incomprehensible as it goes along. And it’s all so damn serious! This one is seriously strange and it’s hard to believe that Connery or Boorman could have done this with a straight face. This is alcohol-required viewing.</li>

Hardy gives a fearless and remarkable performance as the titular character, Britain’s most notorious prisoner. Charlie Bronson has spent 35 years behind bars, at least 30 of which were in solitary confinement. Bronson is such a fascinating character and Hardy plays him with such gusto that you are liable to get as lost in the character as Hardy does. It’s a raw and harsh flick and not for the squeamish but Hardy is a revelation here.</li>

In Ancient Rome, the famed Ninth Legion finds itself decimated after an ambush by enemy forces, leaving only a few survivors trapped deep behind enemy lines.  Think of it as <em>The Warriors</em> in ancient Rome as the ragtag group desperately try to make it home. There are more beheadings, slit throats, and dismemberments than <em>Gladiator</em> and <em>Braveheart</em> combined (if you’re into that sort of thing&mdash;and I know I am!) and the brisk pace and solid production values make this one exciting flick.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s 2011.  Another year bites the dust.  The last thing the world needs is another &#8220;best films of the year&#8221; list, right?  Every film site has one, not to mention the &#8220;official&#8221; lists compiled by SAG, The Hollywood Foreign Press and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (the later of which is <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2009/06/24/2010-oscars-to-have-10-best-picture-nominees/">far too long</a>, but more on that later).  And here I am, too far behind on Hollywood’s current block of must-see films (as usual) to make a best of the year list, and staring at the ranks of my wrap-around-the-block Netflix instant queue, sixty and counting.  Where do I begin?  What’s a fella to do?   It is certainly important to remain current, but my sofa is already under my butt, after all, and my PS3 controller is within reach.</p>
<p>Netflix it is. </p>
<p>At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I don’t know what I’d do without Netflix instant streaming.  As an avid consumer of media, an entertainment glutton, Netflix streaming has become my all-you-can-eat buffet.  Its rapidly growing back catalog has nearly caused me to collapse under the weight of my own excitement and intimidation.  You may recall my post-holiday wish list, wherein I mention my desire to freeze time so that I can catch up on <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/01/the-cinephiles-christmas-list/">EVERY FILM EVER MADE</a> without losing any time?  Well, Netflix can do little about time&mdash;which makes fools of us all&mdash;but they can begin to steadily catalog every film, making them easily accessible from the comfort of my aforementioned sofa.  Netflix is going to make me a film guru. . . and fat and lazy.  That’s okay because people come to gurus, not the other way around.  But I digress.</p>
<p>Since I have spent far more time on Netflix this year than in a theater I have decided to create a very specific “best-of” list in lieu of your standard bit of business.  And so, in no particular order, here is a list of my favorite films viewed in 2010&mdash;but probably made years before&mdash;and viewed for the first time on Netflix instant streaming:</p>
<ul>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Cropsey" src="https://i0.wp.com/cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2010/06/10/1276186975_5524/539w.jpg" alt="" width="323" height="194" /> <strong><em>Cropsey</em> (2009)<br />
Streamed on 11/04/10</strong></p>
<p>Filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio explore the origins of the childhood Boogeyman they dubbed “Cropsey,” and discover direct links to a real life boogeyman named Andre Rand, who may or may not be responsible for multiple child murders on Staten Island. </p>
<p>It has everything you’d want from a compelling documentary and everything you’d expect from a great horror film.  As the two filmmakers delve deeper into Rand’s case, things become more and more surreal.  I won’t spoil the film with any of the details but, suffice it to say, truth is stranger than fiction.  In this case, it’s also scarier.</li>
<li><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Cloudy with a chance of meatballs" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.blogcdn.com/blog.moviefone.com/media/2009/07/cloudycine1.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="163" /> <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em> (2009)<br />
Streamed on 09/25/10</strong></p>
<p>In the world of computer-animated fare Pixar will always reign supreme, but in 2009 Sony Pictures took a tiny step out of Pixar&#8217;s epic shadow with this one.  Sure, it may not be quite as sophisticated, but it’s damned funny, relatively clever and pretty as hell to look at.  Add in some great voice acting from Bill Hader (underrated), Anna Faris and James Caan and you’ve really got something.  Seriously, I’m surprised I liked this as much as I did too!</li>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Terribly Happy" src="https://i1.wp.com/kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2010/04/08/Terribly_Happy_4_t614.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="245" /> <strong><em>Terribly Happy</em> (2008)<br />
Streamed on 7/16/10</strong></p>
<p>In the time-honored tradition of conveying style via hypothetical copulations I shall declare this film to be the product of David Lynch and Coen brothers coital interactions on Paul Thomas Anderson&#8217;s sofa.  Wha?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, this is a fantastically strange, dark little Danish film<a href="#note1">*</a> about a Copenhagen cop banished to a small town after being involved in a bit of shadiness I shall not divulge here.  His attempts to start anew are eventually foiled by unwelcoming townsfolk who like to dump their “problems” into a local bog, a little girl who keeps pushing around a squeaky, empty baby carriage in the middle of the night, and his own psychosis.</li>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="It might get loud" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.forgetthebox.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/it-might-get-loud-jam-460-100-460-70.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="207" /> <strong><em>It Might Get Loud</em> (2008)<br />
Streamed on 10/06/10</strong></p>
<p>Oh man, is this a music nerd&#8217;s dream or what?  Jack White, The Edge and Jimmy Page hangin’, jammin’ and talkin’ axes.  Simple and sweet.</p>
<p>There is a bit of weirdness involving Jack White jamming with a child version of himself, but it’s more than made up for with the film&#8217;s killer intro, in which White constructs a makeshift guitar out of a coke bottle, some wire and a wooden plank.  Now <em>that’s</em> rock and roll.</li>
<li><img class="alignleft" title="Spartan" src="https://i1.wp.com/content7.flixster.com/rtmovie/22/24/22249_gal.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="260" /> <strong><em>Spartan</em> (2004)<br />
Streamed on 3/27/10</strong></p>
<p>There is no getting around it. David Mamet’s dialog is fast, smart, and sharp as a tack.  I enjoy the hell out of it regardless of the quality of the film it’s in (<em>Redbelt</em> is a bit of a sloppy mess). </p>
<p>If pressed I would admit that you simply cannot beat <em>Glengary Glen Ross</em> (1992) for killer Mamet dialog, but <em>Spartan’s</em> got a coolness factor that shouldn’t be denied.  Take, for example, this bit of machismo dialog:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What they gotcha teaching here, young sergeant?”</p>
<p>“Edged weapons, sir.  Knife fighting”</p>
<p>“Don’t you teach ‘em knife fighting.  Teach ‘em to kill.  That way, they meet some sonofabitch who studied knife fighting, they send his soul to hell.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Bam.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s fairly broad agreement that Sony/Quantic Dream’s <em>Heavy Rain</em> was one of the great games of 2010. IGN.com awarded it <a target="new" href="http://bestof.ign.com/2010/ps3/best-ps3-game-of-the-year.html">“Game of the Year” for PS3</a>. It was a finalist for PS3 Game of the Year on Spike TV’s Video Game Awards. (It lost to <em>God of War III</em>, but c’mon, this was Spike TV.) Tom Bissell included it on his list of his <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/09/bissell-top-ten/">10 favorite games of 2010</a>. (I’m allowed a self-plug every now and then.)</p>
<p>Since I’m not sure that I played 10 new games during 2010&mdash;I definitely didn’t play 10 games that came out during 2010&mdash;I have the luxury of not having to decide whether <em>Heavy Rain</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> was a better game. It’s probably safe to say that I expect to play <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> more often in the future. I still have a boatload of trophies to get; I could spend hours playing poker, especially with the downloadable addition that lets me play with real people; I’ve barely touched the <em>Undead Nightmare</em> expansion.</p>
<p>But for all that, <em>Heavy Rain</em> is the game that I want more new games to be like.</p>
<p><em>Heavy Rain</em> is not a perfect game, even in the places where it is strong. As video games go, the story is incredible, engrossing, but not (in absolute terms) revelatory. It&#8217;s a pretty good detective novel and not <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>. It is the first game I&#8217;ve played that takes advantage of the possibilities of narrative quietude. The opening chapters are often described as &#8220;slow&#8221; in reviews&mdash;my own wife used the words &#8220;boring as hell&#8221;&mdash;but they serve to give the player the beginnings of an emotional investment in the main character, Ethan Mars, and his relationships with his family. The sunny tone directly contrasts with the darkness and rain that consume the rest of the game.</p>

<p>Even more than that, the game asks you to care about the mundane, day-to-day life of the main character&mdash;that is to say, his <em>happiness</em> and not just his desires. <em>Heavy Rain</em> asks the player to do very un-game-like tasks: Get dressed. Set the table. Play with your kids. The game defers narrative progress for what feels like a substantial period of time, not just for a tutorial (although the opening chapters are undeniably that), but to ask you to live Ethan&#8217;s life for a little while. The game asks you to trust that the things that you do will matter later, and they do. Not quite in the way promised on the box (&#8220;Your smallest decisions <strong>can change everything</strong>&#8220;&mdash;a promise I&#8217;m not sure the game lives up to), but because when you&#8217;re rushing to find your son before he drowns in slowly rising rainwater, you&#8217;re not just trying to save a collection of pixels. You&#8217;re working to save the boy you played with in your backyard during better times.</p>
<p>And you do some dark things to get there.</p>
<p>Most reviewers have rightly praised <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s &#8220;no game-over&#8221; mechanic, where the game simply continues to progress regardless of &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;wrong&#8221; choices, up to and including those which lead to the deaths of one or more of the four playable characters. Of course, this mechanic isn&#8217;t exactly an innovation. <em>Maniac Mansion</em> used it back in 1987.</p>

Don&#039;t deny it.</p></div> Similarly, while the context-sensitive quick-response actions the player uses to interact with key events are perfectly suited to the game, and somehow make more sense, for example, in a fight scene than the more standardized button-based inputs used by most games. For example, in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the L2 button draws your gun from its holster, and the R2 button pulls the trigger. All the time. In Heavy Rain, the game might ask you to move the right joystick slowly downward to put a plate on a table, or press and hold a specific series of buttons in order to climb on to a ledge, but in either case the inputs only work when the screen asks for them, and they have to be performed in the correct manner&mdash;quickly, gently, all at once&mdash;or the action fails. This is, of course, a more refined version of a quick-response game like the 1983 <em>Dragon&#8217;s Lair</em> (which, incidentally, was re-released this year for the Wii).</p>
<p>In another context, I&#8217;d love to argue about how interactive <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s overarching storyline really is or isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;d happily complain about the one moment where the game betrays its narrative structure&mdash;a character does something that you&#8217;re not aware of, and the game, in effect, lies to you about it. I&#8217;d really enjoy hearing from people what sort of replay value people found from the game, especially in light of the discovery (which kind of surprised me) that <a target="new" href="http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/698809/Quantic-Dreams-David-Cage-Play-Heavy-Rain-Several-Times-Kill-The-Magic-Of-It.html">the game&#8217;s principle designer really thinks that players should only play it once</a>. But here what I really want to say is that <em>Heavy Rain</em> is a game that needs to be imitated, and well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ana Holguin</strong>: In my house, this year&#8217;s Best Catch Phrase/New Word Award goes to &#8220;dubs.&#8221;  Months ago my husband Matt was playing The Settlers of Cataan and our friend Adam announced that he had &#8220;dubs sheep.&#8221;  I was painting in the next room as I am completely uninterested in most games of strategy or storytelling (I only like word games) but my ears perked up when I heard &#8220;dubs.&#8221;  &#8220;Dubs&#8221; was immediately added to my lexicon.  So, now if both of my dachshunds are sitting on me I might report &#8220;I have dubs dogs.&#8221;  2 pencils?  Dubs pencils.  </p>
<p>Dubs cheeseburgers please!  </p>
<p>Dubs shows on the DVR.</p>
<p>Dubs.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: I really love the &#8220;What does this mean??&#8221; meme from the <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI">Double Rainbow</a> video. And as much as I hate to admit it, I&#8217;m sort of tired of hearing that things are &#8220;epic.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: It&#8217;s adorable as an adjective, but I fear over-zealous usage of the word &#8220;epic&#8221; has made it lose some of its epic-ness.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong>: The best/worse/best again catch phrase of the year has to be &#8220;dat&#8217;s bold.&#8221;  As in, &#8220;Did you just tell me to shut up?  Dat&#8217;s bold!&#8221; Or, as overheard after the credits began rolling on the latest Harry Potter film (which is only part one of two, lady, so relax).</p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: “Refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy.” Goddamn right!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: Along with many others, I really fell in love with Mumford &amp; Sons. It turns out there are still bands that make real music, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: Most definitely Gogol Bordello&#8217;s marvelous <em>Trans Continental Hustle</em>. It&#8217;s the 5th studio album by the New York gypsy-punk band, and their sound and manifesto keeps getting richer with each release. Seven of the nine band members are immigrants, hailing from Russia, Israel, Ethiopia, Ecuador and China, with lead singer Eugene Hütz from the Ukraine. The video for the new song <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKoQgODwveE">&#8220;Immigrada&#8221;</a> is a powerful look at the face of immigrants in America. Music critic Robert Christgau has called Gogol Bordello &#8220;the world&#8217;s most visionary band,&#8221; a title they&#8217;ve well-earned. </p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: I can’t be giving away the house here, especially as I was planning on writing about this topic throughout January!</p>
<p>I will offer a few hints for you. . . try to guess what I mean. </p>
<p>Hints:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CD model sued the band</li>
<li>She appears to be underwater</li>
<li>There is a bear on the cover</li>
<li>The CD came with a magazine</li>
</ol>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Mattison</strong>: I didn’t make any great effort to stay musically informed until the end of the year when I purchased Arcade Fire’s <em>The Suburbs</em>, Kanye West’s  <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>, Sufjan Steven’s <em>The Age of Adz</em> and Spoon’s <em>Transference</em> all at once.  All were solid purchases (sans maybe <em>Transference</em>, which I found to be pretty underwhelming).  If I were to pick a favorite, though, I’d have to go with The Roots’ <em>How I Got Over</em>.  It’s top-notch hip hop from start to finish, with the band returning to its more up tempo, jazzy. . . roots.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong>: I used to be one of those people who thought that albums were really, really important. Then I had kids, and now I’m lucky to keep up with songs. This year, my favorites were spacey and atmospheric, with an edge of noise poking through, particularly <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5RzpPrOd-4">“Helicopter”</a> by Deerhunter, <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu7jAl9Sxgg">“Birds”</a> by Margot &amp; the Nuclear So and So’s, and <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh4etIJx7Oc">“Nothing but Our Love”</a> by Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.</p>
