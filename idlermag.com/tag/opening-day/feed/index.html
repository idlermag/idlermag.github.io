										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sure, it&#8217;s still barely above freezing in Michigan. And, yes, were I still in high school (and not just the same height I was in high school) we&#8217;d be taking grounders off the basketball court because no one practices outside in this bullshit weather.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s sunny. Clete Thomas has been sent back to the minors. My coach says things like, &#8220;In a few weeks, when your games start. . . .&#8221; My bridesman, Kyle, has registered both our co-ed teams.</p>
<p>And I, friends, just. Can&#8217;t. Wait. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the dirt of the infield. For the way it sort of turns to dust and clings to your skin after the game, and if you&#8217;re lazy like me (or just in love with the scent, also like me) you&#8217;ll fall asleep in your uniform and wake up with the faintest film of infield-dirt-silkydust-driedsweat to rinse off before heading to work.</p>
<p>You might even enjoy smelling it as it hits the water and transforms into the scent of &#8220;willthisbearaindelay?&#8221;</p>
<p>Miguel Cabrera almost hit for the cycle. I&#8217;ve finally learned to backhand screamers down the line. </p>
<p>A man has, miraculously, convinced me to choke up (and perhaps use a lighter bat). Apparently it&#8217;s not the best plan to use a 34-inch bat when you&#8217;re, um, 62 inches tall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve even started having baseball dreams, a likely consequence of thinking through my swing as I nod off or imagining I&#8217;m a closer like Brian Wilson. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost here. The Tigers open on the road Thursday. We open the first week of May.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you just try to keep me in my desk chair all afternoon when, mentally, I&#8217;m outside fielding grounders and listening the game on the radio.</p>
