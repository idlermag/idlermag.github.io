										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>*Spoiler alert: The following review of <em>The Sixes</em> by Kate White doesn’t tell you who did it, but it tells you who didn’t*</strong></p>
<p><em>Jurassic Park</em> hit theaters for the first time when I was nine years old. My mother had thought about asking our live-in nanny, Lori, to come with us but in the end decided to make the new dinosaur movie a mother-daughter adventure. About a week later Lori came back from the theater after having seen the movie by herself.</p>
<p>“Oh my God! It was so scary!” She announced. “Those dinosaurs! Oh my God!”</p>
<p>My mom and I suppressed smiles. I mean, sure, the dinosaurs were scary. And just because I was nine and she was a grown woman didn’t mean she couldn’t have gotten more scared than I had gotten.</p>
<p>“When they came into the kitchen I was so scared! I shouted out for those poor kids to hide!”</p>
<p>What? I still remember the kitchen scene. Three velociraptors were hunting the young kids and it was dark and terrifying. But shouting? Aloud? In a movie theater?</p>
<p>“I just screamed at them that the dinosaurs were coming. A man from the theater came and asked me to please be quiet, but I couldn’t! I just had to warn them!”</p>
<p>Did I mention she was a grown ass woman? She went on to tell us that she quieted down for a while but then another scary scene came on and she shouted for the characters on the screen to watch out again and had to be quieted by the theater staff again or she needed to leave. My mother and I thanked our lucky stars that we didn’t take her with us. She didn’t last as my nanny much longer after that.</p>
<p>This exchange came to mind after I finished Kate White’s <em>The Sixes</em>. Usually I don’t try to figure out whodunit while reading mysteries but this time I thought I’d give it a go. At one point the main character, Phoebe, starts a romantic relationship with a professor, Duncan Shaw, at the university where she currently teaches. Duncan reveals over dinner that his late wife, dying of cancer, drowned in the bathtub after she fell asleep reading there. The main mystery of the novel surrounded multiple drownings in the river that ran through campus. So of course I’m here, shouting in my head at Phoebe, that DUNCAN DID IT! Watch out lady, he’s a murderer!</p>
<p>I figured that he was impatient for his wife to die, he wanted her money, and was worried that her cancer would go into remission. See, Duncan and his wife were about to separate before she got sick. He was gallant and stayed with her, even moving back to her childhood home, while she lived out her last years. He told Phoebe that people who are severely sick often don’t have the same startle reflex that healthy people have. Normally the inability to breathe would wake someone and prevent their drowning in a bathtub. But his dear dead wife was so ill that her body failed to respond. He had even warned her of the danger of reading in the tub but she ignored him.</p>
<p>LIAR! I shouted! Watch out, Phoebe! He’s asking so many questions about the case because he wants to make sure you aren’t onto him! He killed his wife for her money, she was taking too long to die and then he developed a taste for it. He’s the one who has been drugging young college students and shoving them in the river, their healthy bodies useless, unable to startle them awake enough to swim to shore.</p>
<p>I pictured him watching from the darkened shore. Clearing the slackers and dullards from this small college campus. Someone needed to warn Phoebe. I tried, but like Lori shouting in the theater, it was useless, these characters’ lives were preordained.</p>
<p>Also I was wrong.  </p>
<p>I don’t like being wrong. It’s embarrassing. Not as embarrassing as muttering to a character in a book that they need to use better judgment and stop sleeping with the killer, but close. Duncan didn’t do it. Someone else was shoving students in the river. Phoebe found out eventually, got into trouble, was hospitalized, but came out on top. Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>All the bad guys were taken care of. But I didn’t care. Duncan didn’t do it. My imagination had taken over while I was reading the book. In my opinion, it did a better job than the author’s. Duncan would have made a creepy, dark killer. His motives only a little comprehensible. His manner unassuming, sexy, persuasive. If he were the killer the book would have been better. </p>
<p>That’s why I don’t try to figure out how books end. I don’t keep track of clues and piece together the hints and evidence. If I’m right, why read the book? It had better be superbly written to keep me going once I know the bad guy. And if I’m wrong, I feel tricked. Kate White was pointing all the fingers in the world at Duncan. Looking back, it was too obvious. I should have known better. I might have even guessed the real killer if I hadn’t been too busy shouting about the wrong guy. </p>
<p>It made me mad at White for fooling me. She could have written the book without making Duncan look so guilty. It would have been better, in my opinion if either Duncan had done it or if he had a smaller role in the whole thing. Who likes feeling stupid? I understand not wanting to reveal the bad guy too soon, as an author you want readers to finish the book and then go buy your other books as well. But there is a fine line to walk and White overstepped. Maybe I was easier to fool because I was new to playing detective. But I still didn’t like how the ending unfolded. My bad guy was the better bad guy.</p>
<p>So I was wrong, tricked, and disappointed. Not a great way to end a book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading Gillian Flynn’s <i>Gone Girl </i>I have had occasion to be irritated with my husband. Each time I think, <i>yes, I’m mad, but am I mad enough to frame him for my murder?</i> Lucky for both of us the answer keeps coming up a strong no.</p>
<p><i>Gone Girl </i>is one of those books that stays with you. You think about the characters a lot. About how true to life their actions are. How close they are to an everyday couple and how far they stretch that commonness until suddenly they are no longer recognizable as the couple next door. I had difficulty going to sleep after reading <i>Gone Girl</i>. It was hard to put down, yes, but it also led to unsettling dreams.</p>
<p>The bare bones plot is this: Amy and Nick have had a difficult few years in their marriage. On their five-year anniversary Amy goes missing and husband Nick is the number one suspect. No real surprise there, we’ve all seen enough <em>Law and Order</em> episodes to know that the husband usually did it. The book is written from Nick’s point of view, with every other chapter being an excerpt from Amy’s diary.  And trust me, this is not a diary Nick wants the police to find. You learn that Amy has faked her disappearance to punish Nick for their unhappiness. (Don’t worry, that doesn’t spoil much.)</p>
<p>In the beginning I was on the fence about Nick. He seemed nice enough but I didn’t really like him. I was reasonably sure that he did not kill his wife, he seemed too bewildered by her disappearance to have committed a crime, but I felt more pity for him than affection. Not a great set of emotions for a reader to have about a main character, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Amy was a different story all together. I never liked her. She seemed like she was trying too hard to be what Nick wanted in the beginning, trying to convince herself that she wanted those things too. Her views on their courtship and marriage tell a sadder story than Nick’s. Things had been bad long before either one of them noticed. The more I learned about Amy the less I liked her. For Nick there were points where I really cared for him, rooted for him, and saw some humanity in him. For Amy? Well, for every page I read I felt a little more desire to see her dead body wash ashore from the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Gillian Flynn does amazing things in <i>Gone Girl</i>. I don’t want to give away too much of the plot, since she keeps you guessing the entire time. I am not the type of person to try to piece together whodunit but I think that the number of twists would surprise even those readers who like to solve the case.</p>
<p>What I was pleasantly surprised about was how much I liked the book without liking the main characters. The more I learned about Nick the less I liked him, but I still needed to know what happened next. That was unusual for me. In most cases if I don’t connect with a character I give up. Who cares if they find the wife of this jerky guy? Flynn’s writing style and plot development were what I enjoyed. And in the end it worked out pretty well that I didn’t like Amy or Nick. They were self-centered and a little psychotic, I’ll let you judge how psychotic, and they don’t end up very happy in the end.</p>
<p>The alternating narrators do more than help move the plot along. It provides some insight into how a marriage falls apart. Seeing Nick and Amy’s differing opinions on so many events really makes you wonder how they were ever happy, <i>if</i> they were ever happy. Nick truly knows nothing about his wife. At first you think that if only he had paid attention, listened better then they wouldn’t be in this failing marriage. But Amy wasn’t as forthcoming as she pretended to be. And then there’s that whole crazy person thing that you really need to watch out for when you get married. It really sets the whole tone for a relationship.</p>
<p>Every morning I would regale my husband with what I had read the night before. He would give me horrified looks as I told him how Nick had officially been arrested, how the crime scene was suspicious, that Amy was a conniving bitch. The whole plot starts from such a normal place and then events spiral out of control. And then when I finished the book and filled him in on the final details he asked the question I’m sure Gillian Flynn wants all husbands who read <i>Gone Girl</i> to ask: “Honey, you would never do that to me, right?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the opening pages of Josephine Tey&#8217;s classic mystery novel <em>Brat Farrar</em> (1950), a young man decides to commit a crime. The crime is impersonation and the motive is money, of course.</p>
<p>The young man, the eponymous Brat (a derivation of “Bart”), looks almost exactly like Patrick Ashby, who had disappeared, believed a suicide, eight years before. Patrick was the older of twins, and would have been just about to turn 21 and inherit the family estate, Latchetts, a successful horse-breeding operation. An Ashby family friend conceives of the plan. He convinces Brat to learn the details and secrets of Patrick&#8217;s life at Latchetts, “become” Patrick, and split the inheritance with his backstage prompter. Brat, drawn by a love, not of money, exactly, but of horses, and a surprisingly deep desire to just see Latchetts, appears as the long-lost heir and “returns” with reasonable fanfare to the family home.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not exactly right. The opening pages of <em>Brat Farrar</em> don&#8217;t focus on Brat. They take place at Latchetts, with Patrick&#8217;s aunt Bea, who had taken care of Patrick&#8217;s twin, Simon, and two younger children, Ruth and Jane, since their parents&#8217; death in an plane crash. It is the anniversary of that day eight years ago when Patrick had disappeared and they had found a letter from him on the cliff overlooking the ocean. Bea has never understood it, and she fears that Patrick, the serious little boy, is fading from everyone&#8217;s memories. That&#8217;s because this story is not just an intricately plotted mystery, but a family story, the story of the prodigal returned, and a meditation on what can be inherited.</p>
<p>For the characters at Latchetts, Brat&#8217;s resemblance to what Patrick would have become is so uncanny that they cannot doubt that he is Patrick. Brat is accepted by everyone &#8212; except for Patrick&#8217;s twin Simon, whose inheritance he is stealing. Why doesn&#8217;t Simon expose Brat? And how long can Brat keep up the masquerade? Under the calm rhythms of country life is a deep pit of hate and violence. Horses are a key metaphor. Brat is drawn to Latchetts because of their horses, and he wants nothing more than to spend his life working with them, but he knows the danger: he walks with a halt because he was thrown from a horse in the American West.</p>
<p>A novel set among horse breeders cannot help but have heredity as a motif. That&#8217;s one thing that puzzles Brat and Brat&#8217;s Svengali. Why does Brat look and act so much like an Ashby? His love of horses, is it from some unknown Ashby blood? Why is Brat so drawn to Latchetts? None of the characters or even Tey have any doubt that heredity doesn&#8217;t lie, that families no less than horses breed true. This is not something we tend to believe today, but it&#8217;s the logic of fairy tales. <em>Brat Farrar</em> is a fairy tale about an orphan finding his real family masquerading as a Golden Age British mystery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hilary Tamar, a professor of legal history at Oxford, is devoted to the sacred cause of Scholarship, not to mention Truth.  But Hilary (gender unspecified) regularly ditches that high calling to instead investigate and solve crimes in Sarah Caudwell’s four mystery novels about British barristers.  I read them all recently and enjoyed the heck out of their arch, erudite, epistolary style.</p>
<p>The novels revolve around Hilary and hir friends, three young barristers at 63 New Square, and a fourth character in a tax practice next door.  Hilary is always just dropping in at Chambers to find someone to buy wine and dinner &#8212; always just in time to hear about a complicated tax or inheritance case that inevitably ends in mysterious deaths. “I am a historian,” says Hilary, “my profession largely consists in speaking ill of the dead.”  The friends &#8212; Cantrip, Ragweed, Selena and Julia &#8212; all have personalities and backstories, but they&#8217;re vaguely sketched and tend to contribute to the stories mostly clever, allusive dialogue and bottles of wine.  Hilary is also an enigma as to age, gender, and any interests besides being well-fed, insulting Cantabrigians, and ditching as often as possible an ongoing research project on the concept of <em>causa</em> in medieval common law.  Hilary is a don, full stop.</p>
<p>The four novels, all named after classical references and with cover art by Edward Gorey, each take place in a different locale, evocatively sketched by Caudwell. In <em>Thus Was Adonis Murdered</em> (1981), Julia takes a vacation in Venice but a young man from her tour group is found dead &#8212; with Julia&#8217;s copy of the Finance Act beside the corpse. <em>The Shortest Way to Hades</em> (1984) involves a complicated Probate case and takes place on Corfu.</p>
<p><em>The Sirens Sang of Murder</em> (1989) is my favorite. In the other novels, the characters are forver writing each other letters (theoretically to supplement their short phone conversations) but in this one Chambers has been equipped with a telex. Cantrip is attending a meeting of a trust in the Channel Islands when mysterious happenings ensue &#8212; I suspect this is the only epistolary novel ever told through telexes.</p>
<p>The last novel, <em>The Sibyl in her Grave</em>, published after Caudwell&#8217;s death in 2000, is an English village mystery. But the characters seem rather uncomfortable to be so far in the future, and one wishes she had just set the novel back in the 80s. </p>
<p>Caudwell, the pen name for Sarah Cockburn, seems to have been a character herself, a pipe smoking crossword puzzle enthusiast who worked as a tax lawyer before quitting to be a full-time novelist. The novels demonstrate a fond exasperation for English law as well as for the usual tropes of mystery novels. In <em>The Sirens Sang of Murder</em>, an engraved pen is found in a suspicious place, and Julia objects to its obviousness as a clue. “I do not doubt,” Hilary replies, “that in a crime novel having any pretensions to modernity, the pen would be quite inadmissible. As a mere historian, however, there is nothing I can do about it. Nature, as we know, does imitate Art, but I fear that she too often falls short of the highest standards.” I admit that I never thought that novels about tax law could be so entertaining.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>SPOILER ALERT: In this review of <em>Faithful Place</em>, I&#8217;m going to talk about how the book ends. I usually shy away from that when I talk about books. It’s my hope that people will actually want to read the books I write about, and often knowing the ending can keep people from picking up the book. If you are that sort of a person, suffice it to say that <em>Faithful Place</em> is a compelling murder mystery about lost love and the dark places that only family can take you. You should go read it. Otherwise, you have been warned.</strong></p>
<p>Tana French’s <em>Faithful Place</em>, the third book in the loosely related <em>Dublin Murder Squad</em> series, is a literary mystery. I haven’t read the first two books &#8212; this one sort of fell in my lap &#8212; but it didn’t matter. The main character, Frank Mackey, is introduced in book two, <em>The Likeness</em>, where he has a minor role. Or so the coworker who recommended Tana French tells me. </p>
<p>The first thing we learn about Frank is that he’s a divorced undercover agent and he tries very hard to be a good dad. The second thing you learn is that his high school sweetheart, Rosie, who he thought stood him up decades ago, was actually murdered. It goes downhill for Frank from there.</p>
<p>He travels back home to Faithful Place, which he’s avoided since he thought Rosie left without him. Frank has been heartbroken for twenty-two years and it shows in all of his personal relationships. His ex-wife saw it from the start and as the reader sees both how vividly he remembers every detail of Rosie and that he’s never really loved anyone else since.</p>
<p>I kind of read the book in dread. Once some workers find Rosie’s suitcase in an abandoned house, Frank knows she never left. And if she never left with her suitcase and the ferry tickets and no one ever saw her around the neighborhood again, she has to be dead. I had to wait with Frank, sitting on a stoop across from the house, for the police to find the body. I felt every minute of it, but the writing was beautiful. It’s not the kind of book you stop reading <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/02/14/the-stuff-of-dreams/">unless you have a very good reason</a>.</p>
<p>As Frank works around the murder squad detectives, I almost felt like I was a step ahead of him. I didn’t necessarily know what each person he interviewed would say, but I saw where it would lead. I wanted him to stop. I wanted him to love Rosie just a little less, to think more about the good in life and less about events that no one could change. Through his searching you see his love for Rosie and his painful associations with his family. He’s kept in touch with his younger sister Jackie for years, but no one else even knows he has a daughter. His brother Kevin, four years his junior, always worshiped Frank. Even though everyone else in Faithful Place hates that he’s a cop, Kevin is still in awe of his big brother.</p>
<p>Shay and Carmel, the two oldest siblings, have lived a very different life than the younger three. With a mostly unemployed, always alcoholic father and a mother willing to blame the kids for the drinking, no one had a happy childhood. As you read along you see how hard Shay tried to protect his siblings from the abuse. He was the one who got hit, the one who quit school to bring in money, the one who stayed home so Carmel could get married and so someone would be around to watch the young ones.</p>
<p>Tana lets you feel Shay’s frustration at the discovery that nineteen-year-old Frank was running off to London with Rosie. Shay was finally supposed to be free. It was Frank’s turn to protect Kevin and Jackie like Shay had protected him. Finally the eldest was going to be able to have a life and it was slipping through his fingers. </p>
<p>You see, Shay never meant to kill Rosie. He thought he could convince her to make Frank stay. But his anger got the best of him. And while there’s never an excuse for murder, I felt for Shay in the end the same way I felt for Frank in the beginning. Tana takes such good care of her characters that the “bad guy” tugs at your heartstrings just as much as the “good guy.” She’s smart enough to know that in a fucked up family situation, no one comes out smelling like roses. The smell of Faithful Place never left Frank and now he’s stuck with far too much knowledge of what happened the night Rosie never showed.</p>
<p>There’s more that I won’t tell you. (Yes, there&#8217;s more! Go read it.) I wished the father had done it instead of the brother. He was the one flat character and I could have easily pinned everything on him. Even Frank’s mother had some sympathetic qualities, but his father was black-hearted all the way through. Tana gives him a backstory trying to explain some of the anger and bitterness but it fell short for me. He lost the girl he loved and settled for his wife. As far as the sympathy angle goes, it works more in the mother’s favor.</p>
<p>In the end the book was powerfully written if not a little too heart-breaking. I recommend it to anyone who likes their mystery books to have a little soul. My coworker promises that her other books aren’t as dark. Although what could match a brother killing his sibling’s girlfriend and hiding the body for twenty-two years? I think this is a set of books that I’ll need light-hearted fluff to read in between so I don’t get too disappointed with humanity. I’ll still love every word.</p>
