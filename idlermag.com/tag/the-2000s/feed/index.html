					<description><![CDATA[Maybe it’s the Robert Fick jersey popping up at a road game, or a talking head mentioning the time Shane Halter played all nine positions in one game. Sometimes it’s my brother reminding me of the guy I dated that one summer who looked like Rich Becker, or how the name Chad Kreuter seemed to us as children both vaguely pornographic and slightly B-movie horror madman-esque.

However they’re called up, the specters of the players we grew up with (and had perhaps even entirely forgotten about until they were invoked, like disembodied voices at a séance) still linger near the dirt of the on-deck circle, exist, somehow, side by side with Miguel Cabrera even though maybe they’re now living in Florida or running a limo company or imprisoned in South America.

So when Binge (B + Inge = Binge, and describes, for this fan, his feast-or-famine approach to offense) poked one through the infield, turning his all-time hits ticker from 999 to 1000, it was only fitting that the leading edge of Bobby Higginson’s right forearm could be seen as his transparent self marked a cautious lead at third, his whole mouth stuffed with Big League chew and, of course, that fabulous goatee meticulously trimmed.

<p>And why wouldn’t Higgy be there? He’d played with Inge since the day Brandon made it up from the minors in 2001. They slogged through terrible seasons together, including the back-to-back 106- and 119-loss seasons. Higginson, who exited the game quietly in 2005, playing just 10 games and retiring in the offseason, was the last Tiger to get 1000 hits with the team.</p>
<p>Maybe it was something like unfinished business that kept the five-years-ago Higgy haunting the base paths.</p>
<p>When Higginson hung up his cleats, he did so without ever having a winning season under his belt, let alone having the success of the following season, when the Tigers tore through their opponents like some kind of nuclear disaster and entered the World Series as the best Cinderella story since the Boston Red Sox a few years prior. </p>
<p>I don’t know why, but he seems to be hanging around the edges of major league baseball lately. </p>
<p>Higgy is a Philadelphia native, and when the Phillies’ Roy Halladay tossed a perfect game this season, sharp fans were quick to note that Halladay took a no-hitter into the 9th on September 27, 1998, when the intended third out, Higginson, broke it up with a home run.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the way Higginson sort of disappeared slowly, like Marty McFly’s hand. Maybe it’s the silence, the lack of a formal announcement preserved in the annals of the internet, the full page ad in Detroit papers, thanking the fans, which we all remember him placing but seems to occupy a disintegrated sheaf of newsprint I cannot find record of now.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s got something to do with the fact that he hasn’t said a word about the Tigers since he retired, and he certainly hasn’t been brought back to the ballpark except by fans like me, who swear they see him swaggering out of the dugout on his way to left field.</p>
<p>It’s the same as the backyard game, playing short teams and calling for ghost runners. Even though you’d just been there, standing on third, and now you were knocking the bat against the soles of your shoes, you could still see your forty-seconds-ago self out of the corner of your eye, getting a lead. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The decade's five best, most influential comedies are all on Netflix's "Watch Instantly" online streaming service. What are the odds?

In this short series, I'm going to watch each of them&#8212;notice I'm using the future tense, even though I've totally gone back and watched all of these&#8212;and pick them off and break them down one by one. How have they held up? What do we learn about them (and about us) by rewatching them? I'll also pull in some additional commentary&#8212;some from earlier in the decade, some later&#8212;that helps offer some perspective on (re)watching these series. And I'll definitely be letting you know what I think, offering my take on how we got here.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Gavin and Kev asked me to write something about pop culture, I knew exactly what I wanted my column to be about: old TV. Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, BitTorrent, iTunes, Amazon, DVDs, old cassette tapes I recorded as a kid &#8212; I eat it all up.</p>
<p>The stars have aligned. The last decade&#8217;s five best, most influential comedies are all on Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Watch Instantly&#8221; online streaming service.</p>
<p>I know. You&#8217;re guessing. For the record, here are the five I&#8217;m thinking of, in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Futurama</em></li>
<li><em>The Office</em> (UK)</li>
<li><em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em></li>
<li><em>Arrested Development</em></li>
<li><em>30 Rock</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, yes: a complete list of the decade&#8217;s best comedies would have to include (definitely) <em>The Daily Show</em> and (probably) <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>. But <em>The Daily Show</em> is available on <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/">Comedy Central&#8217;s own competing site</a>, and HBO holds on to their original series like they&#8217;re money. Because they are.</p>
<p>This is the best Netflix could do. Once you add in <em>South Park</em>,<em> King of the Hill</em>, the US/Steve Carell version of <em>The Office</em>, and terrific runs of older classics like <em>SNL</em>, <em>Monty Python</em>, and <em>Soap</em>, plus cult hits like <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> and the <em>Kids in the Hall</em> pilot, you&#8217;re talking a serious stash of the funny.</p>
<p>Out of this shortlist, besides the just-now-airing new episodes of <em>Futurama</em>, <em>30 Rock</em> is the only show that doesn&#8217;t have the entire series available online. (Once Season 5 starts airing, I bet we&#8217;ll see Season 4 in the queue too.) And even though it&#8217;s probably the most universally well-regarded sitcom on TV now &#8212; it&#8217;s definitely my favorite &#8212; in terms of influence and originality, <em>30 Rock</em> is fifth out of five. I love the show, I could quote and rewatch it endlessly, but you could make a good case that all it&#8217;s really done is mix and match elements of the other four. Liz Lemon is equal parts Michael Bluth and Turanga Leela, with a dash of Homer Simpson. We get to watch her spin her wheels in her workplace, which is filled with dweebs, losers, cartoons, and ethnic stereotypes. Sounding familiar?</p>

Loser.</p></div>
<p>Odds are, if you&#8217;re a fan at all, you probably remember most of these episodes of <em>30 Rock</em> pretty well. Or you&#8217;re trying/hoping to catch up. Even if you don&#8217;t watch the show, you know a lot about it; your friends watch it, you see commercials, it&#8217;s still in the atmosphere. But with any of the other four comedies, it&#8217;s likely that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>You saw them and enjoyed them, but don&#8217;t remember any of the episodes well beyond a few big moments;</li>
<li>You heard about them and maybe wanted to watch, or watch more often, but wound up missing them altogether;</li>
<li>They&#8217;re your favorite comedy ever, you&#8217;ve memorized your favorite episodes, and you&#8217;re delighted that someone is finally asking you to talk about them rather than begging you to stop; OR</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t like any of them. In which case, I don&#8217;t like you. Get the hell out of here and go watch Season 3 of <em>Heroes</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this short series, I&#8217;m going to watch* and write about each of them, picking them off and breaking them down one by one.</p>
<p>*Notice I&#8217;m using the future tense for &#8220;watch&#8221;, even though I&#8217;ve totally gone back and watched all of these and am already on my second run through <em>Arrested Development</em>.</p>
<p>How have these shows held up? What do we learn about them (and about us) by rewatching them?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also pull in some additional commentary—some from earlier in the decade, contemporary with these show&#8217;s airdates, and some from later—that can give us some perspective while (re)watching these series.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll definitely be letting you know what I think, offering my take on how we got here.</p>
<p>But in this first post, just to set the stage, and so everyone knows the baseline we&#8217;re starting from, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to you in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;ve never seen / are a total geek for one of them, out yourselves.</li>
<li>What do you remember or not remember, like or dislike in these shows?</li>
<li>Where would <em>you</em> rank them?</li>
<li>Also—where would the 2004 version of yourself rank them?</li>
</ul>
<p>As we&#8217;ve changed, the world&#8217;s changed, and comedy&#8217;s changed, this turns out to be a more meaningful question that you might think.</p>
