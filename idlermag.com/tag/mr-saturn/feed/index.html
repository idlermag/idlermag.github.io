										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>EarthBound</em> is not lacking in the quirky characters department in the least. This is a good thing, as it is one of the game&#8217;s strong points. There are plenty of <em>What the French Toast?</em> moments in <em>EarthBound</em>.</p>
<p>Case in point, <a title="EarthBound wiki" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Saturn">Mr. Saturn</a>.</p>
<p>That is to say, <em>all</em> of the Mr. Saturns. Yes, there is more than one. In fact, there is a whole village. The beings known as the Mr. Saturns inhabit a village on the other side of Threed, that town full of zombies. They are short, bulbous pink-things with large noses, beady eyes and a single piece of hair decorated with a ribbon.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Oh, and the Mr. Saturns all have their own font for speech and talk all wacky (adding words such as &#8220;boing&#8221; and &#8220;zoom&#8221;). But, these attributes are all endearing, even if they are very strange.</p>
<p>Adding to the strangeness of the visit to Saturn Valley is the next stop: taking on <a title="EarthBound Wiki" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Belch">Master Belch</a> &#8212; a living pile of vomit. Yes, <em>vomit</em>. With a face and capable of speech. He uses burp attacks against the party, perhaps marking the first time I ever heard a burp sound effect in a video game (which was pretty high-tech in the mid-1990s).</p>
<p>Better still, Master Belch commands smaller piles of living puke in his Fly Honey factory (where a few Mr. Saturns are enslaved and need rescuing). They also use burps and stench attacks against the party.</p>
<p>I ran into a bit of a snag while fighting Master Belch &#8212; Ness became <a title="Yes, this is a thing in the game." href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Homesick">Homesick</a>, which renders him nearly useless in a battle. Not what you want to happen in a boss fight. It was especially challenging, since Ness carried the Fly Honey I needed to distract Master Belch during the battle. After a few tries, I was able to use the item, but I cut it close &#8212; and had I died, I would have had to start the factory all over again (<em>EarthBound</em>&#8216;s lack of a save system similar to the likes of <em>Final Fantasy</em> causes a lot of frustration).</p>
<p>After besting the pile of puke, I returned to the Saturn village, where I was treated to some kind of mind-altering, psychedelic coffee. This game gets stranger by the moment, and that is why I love it.</p>
