										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comic books aren’t great with beginnings and endings, to be honest. As a serialized medium, very few stories have their complete start and finish in a single volume and often rely on a whole host of other stories to make complete sense. When I was a kid, though, nobody I knew really cared if it all made complete sense. The experience of reading a comic was immersive and fantastic and yes, made you want to get more of the same, but not necessarily because anything was missing in the book you just finished. No, I wanted more because every comic built another unique experience on top of what I had just gotten, sort of like a messy stack of bricks. Gaps existed, mortar would gush out around the edges, but I was building my sense of imagination, not some fortress of continuity. If it toppled, no one would get hurt. I could just reuse and rearrange the bricks in a new formation.</p>
<p>The single-issue story definitely helped this process along when I was growing up. There aren’t too many of those today, as readers have gotten older and simultaneously more demanding that every comic be a compelling starting point for new readers, but also continue to reflect everything that has come before it. The done-in-one story (or is it one-and-done? The debate rages.) is largely looked upon as filler, or an interlude, or at worst, a waste &#8212; easily skipped over as the main serial will pick-up its next six to eleven part story next month. I love a great serial, don’t get me wrong. The cliffhangers. The continuing subplots. The ability to look back from the end to see the clues laid months ago at the beginning. These are all awesome aspects of storytelling you can’t get in a single 20 pages &#8212; to the same degree anyway. But as a kid, nothing made me more happy than having a single book I could read again and again and again, and enjoy a little bit differently each time, without having to track down part 3 of 4, or worry about how Superman managed to be here AND in <em>Justice League of America</em> the same month. He just was. </p>
<p>See how easy that is?</p>
<p>I have a few of these books littered throughout my collection. They often are the single issues I see on a rack or in a drawer at a comic shop and just can’t help myself from buying again. Yes, I know I have two copies already &#8212; the ripped up original from when I was 9 and the one adult-me bought to replace it in my “formal collection” &#8212; but this one is near mint, people. And how often am I going to be able to relive that flicker of joy that I got from buying it the first time. If even an infinitesimal spark remains, it’s worth experiencing. I just can’t explain the compulsion any other way. So came across my path <em>Detective Comics</em> #526 the other day.</p>
<p>An extra-sized comic (cover-price $1.50!) from May 1983, this issue was billed largely on the cover as Batman’s 500th appearance in <em>Detective Comics</em>, as the Dark Knight made his intellectual debut in the title’s 27th issue way back in 1939. Not quite a round year anniversary, this story stood out at the time, however, due to its gold ink cover accent and square bound size, not to mention featuring the headshots of pretty much every major Batman villain to date swirling around Batman and his crime-fighting colleagues. Good enough for me. And the cover, pretty cleverly designed from my now-art director’s standpoint as well, lived up to its promise. Upon opening, the reader was treated immediately to a congregation of every major criminal the Bat-family had put away in these 500 issues, and a foreboding title, “All My Enemies Against Me!” Seeing these purveyors of purloinment lined up across a theatre stage was a young reader’s dream, as I could finally have one place to count off and name all the baddies that previously remained scattered throughout my memory and piles of books. </p>

<p>And immediately there was controversy! Talia al Ghul was in love with Batman and wouldn’t go along with the Joker’s plans, no matter how many times she’d tricked the Dark Knight in the past. And Catwoman too had recently moved over to the side of the angels, quickly scooting out on her invite to mistakenly fued with Talia later on. Two ladies vying for Batman’s affections! Even the young homosexual in me was a little bit impressed. Or maybe jealous. And frankly confused. If I were Batman, the choice would clearly be the one wearing the outfit and motif that most closely resembled my own. Catwoman was a no-brainer, Bruce. Let’s be honest.</p>

<p>Batgirl’s arrival on the scene to shake-up a constantly brooding Dick Grayson &#8212; we were long past the golly-gee portion of Robin’s adventures &#8212; was another high-point for me, as the dominoed daredoll was treated with some rare respect in the Batbooks here by prolific writer Gerry Conway. Previously written as having been easily thrown off the trail of the boys’ secret identities, Babs here all but rolled her eyes at Dick’s surprise. She is, after all, a detective. And as the two of them cycled off to track down the parents of young circus trapeze artist Jason Todd (there’s a plot clue in there for the savvy Bat-fan), you could feel that both Robin and Batgirl were not only equals to each other, but growing closer to living up to the example set forth by their mentor himself, the Batman. It was a unique time for all of these characters, long before the family expanded and sons and daughters took turns seeing who could frown the hardest. You feel as if they’re a true family, but one just about to go their separate ways, leaving a significant hole to fill in Batman’s home and methodology.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11210" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/05/30/one-and-done/oneanddone3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,416" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="OneandDone3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=416" alt="Jason Todd" width="640" height="416" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11210" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=98 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/oneanddone3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=195 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> </p>
<p>Enter young (red-haired) Jason Todd, who discovers the entrance to the Batcave, finds a spare costume in a dusty old trunk, and stows away inside the Batmobile as Batman, Talia and Catwoman speed away to track down Killer Croc. In the course of events, Jason hears Croc is responsible for the deaths of his parents earlier in the issue, and newly orphaned, flies into action alongside the original orphaned warrior himself. By the end of this issue (Phew! A lot happened here!), you can see Bruce and Jason walking the grounds of Wayne Manor, a new partner in the making just as his previous one is about ready to spread his wings and leave the nest. </p>
<p>Exactly thirty years later, I can recall every panel, every word of this comic like Watchtower bell-ringers know the Bible. I know this book to such a degree that it even begs the question why I needed to buy another (or any) copy. It’s all right up here in my head, and probably will be until the day I die. And it doesn’t much matter that it was Batman’s 500th appearance, or the first time we got to see Jason Todd in costume. It was so many things and none of them. Maybe it was just the time of my life I read it. Or maybe I was just more open to the experience it promised me than I would be today, amid a flush of other books and comics and papers begging for my attention. In any event, I feel blessed to have the memory of such a unique experience and that it remains today as an important one to me.</p>
<p>I have no doubt my time writing for <em>The Idler</em> will remain much like that as well. Before starting my column here, I was a frequent tweeter, sure, but hadn’t been offered the very generous opportunity to share my words with such a distinguished audience, alongside such a brilliant group of authors. It’s an experience that has opened my eyes to things I never thought about, forced me to be prolific, motivated me to expand my skills, and led me to meet and partner with some absolutely amazing people. So, thanks, everyone, for the memories, and may they live on here in perpetuity for us all to revisit and reclaim just a little bit of that spark every time we do.</p>
<p>And for those who want to read more from me, I will be easily found at <a href="http://www.comicosity.com/" target="_blank">Comicosity.com</a>, taking with me the mantra I have since ingrained in my writing (and living) this past year and some months: <em>refusing to apologize for the things we enjoy</em>. May it always be so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently at a party in which I met a gentleman who tried to convince me that the third <em>Matrix</em> film is the finest of the trilogy. Needless to say, I was aghast and spent the next several minutes arguing against this delusional notion until finally my wife wisely and diplomatically separated me from this poor misguided individual. The conversation got me thinking about how almost everyone I know likes at least two or three widely reviled popular culture creations. There’s the friend who thinks that Guns N’ Roses’s <em>Chinese Democracy</em> was a masterpiece which was well worth the wait. The girl I know that loved <em>Battleship Earth</em> or the guy who doesn’t know why NBC didn’t produce a second season of <em>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</em> (actually, that last person would be me.)</p>
<p>It is surprising that we often feel very strongly about the need to defend and justify our beliefs about these underappreciated cultural works. In doing so we are not only defending the things in question but also our own tastes and in some way our validity as social and cultural commentators. It matters to many of us that our friends and colleagues respect our opinions and understand why we believe what we do. Which is why this column is about my appreciation of <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin, The Boy Wonder</em>. The often-delayed Frank Miller and Jim Lee ten issue series is almost universally despised by both critics and comic book readers alike but I have a strange affinity for the story. Reviewers generally praise Lee’s artwork but despise Miller’s storytelling. I, on the other hand, appreciate both creators’ work, and find that the two mesh together to create something unique and exciting, the likes of which I have never seen. The narrative showcases a nearly psychopathic Batman who seems to be teetering on the brink of sanity as he drags a twelve year old Dick Grayson into his war against crime. There is nothing likable about this Dark Knight, he’s extremely violent, overly profane, masochistic, and bordering on sadistic. He is not a good guy and may not be a hero. He is a deeply troubled man who tortures criminals, kidnaps little boys, seems to be devoid of empathy, and is only concerned about himself. He is a highly unsavory character who displays many of humanity’s worst traits and is a role model for no one. </p>

<p>The logical question to ask at this point is; if this Batman is truly so unpleasant why do I like the story so much? In truth it is because this version of the Dark Knight has little to no redeeming qualities or social value. To my mind this Batman is the logical extension of many of the Caped Crusader’s traits taken to the highest degree. Batman has often been portrayed as disturbed, violent, arrogant, and pompous. These characteristics were soft-pedaled or muted by other more desirable qualities in past stories. This book enhances the Dark Knight’s core self and displays how unbecoming such a hero truly would be. I read it as a commentary on society in a post-September 11th world (the first issue was published in 2005.) The narrative asks the reader to consider what price is he/she willing to pay for security and what amount of freedom is he/she willing to sacrifice in the process. I find the effort to be bold and rather forward thinking. It follows the tradition of Miller’s own <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em> and Alan Moore&#8217;s <em>Watchmen</em> in presenting the negative aspects of superheroes but it does it at an intensity never before seen in a story featuring one of the comic industry’s best known characters. I can understand why some readers are repulsed by the effort but I believe that such feelings are the point of the story. We should be repulsed, the idea that a mentally unstable billionaire dresses as a bat and violently fights crime would bother many of us if these events happened in the real world. I understand that Batman is fantasy and that escapist literature provides an avenue to flee reality for awhile but isn’t Miller’s notion of a maximized Batman something worth considering?</p>
<p>The other reason that I like <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> so much is in many ways the opposite of my above way of thinking. This Batman story takes place in the same universe as Miller’s most notable Batman stories: <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</em>, <em>Batman: Year One</em>, and <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</em>. When combined these stories create a dense narrative that presents the Dark Knight at the beginning of his career and at the end. This progression is fascinating and allows the reader to see how the Batman from <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> was created and how he changed. It provides insight into numerous plot points and story details that were before unexplored. Miller has created a sinister universe in which not only Batman has become a super-enhanced version of himself but so too have other heroes like Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow. Like Batman, these characters’ core qualities are maintained but are taken to their furthest logical extent. <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> rewards readers that follow along closely and connect the dots from previous stories. The narrative also contains numerous Easter eggs from throughout DC Comics history and encourages the reader to consider Batman’s mythos and how the character has progressed since 1939 when he began as a hardcore vigilante.</p>

<p>So, that’s my overall spiel. I doubt I’ve convinced many of you because I imagine a large number of readers find the story to be too distasteful to stick with and also because I didn’t give any concrete examples from the book. The problem is that I don’t think I have room to fit any good illustrations into this column. To remedy this I am going to use future columns to review individual issues of <em>All-Star Batman &amp; Robin</em> and give tangible examples of why I think the narrative is so good. Imagine me as the guy at the party who is trying his best to convince you to rethink something you have written off as inferior. Feel free to argue with me, I’d like the input and relish the challenge. Hopefully the hors d&#8217;oeuvres are good, the beer is plentiful, and I don’t have spinach in my teeth.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent my summer watching superhero movies. We went through all of the X-Men movies, saw <em>The Avengers</em> at least five times which led to rewatching the Iron Man movies as well, and after watching all three of Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies my husband encouraged me to watch the 1992 <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>. </p>
<p>When I was a kid I read comic books. I demanded my father read to me from a novel sized copy of <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> every night. I remember reading and rereading the comic book where Superman dies. That huge rock monster dies too, but I was distraught, how could Superman be dead? I think I read a little Batman here and there, never read any Spider-Man or X-Men though. </p>
<p>Once I moved on to novels I never really looked back. Comic books were something I had done with my father and after he passed away I didn’t have anyone bringing new comic books into my life. I think I viewed them as a phase that was in my past. Stories with pictures went out the window once I moved past chapter books. I’m not saying comic books are childish, so don’t get up in arms, no one is being insulted here. I still love superheroes and I wish I didn’t need to confirm details with my husband about the movies we watched this summer. </p>
<p>His favorite superhero is Batman. The hero with no powers &#8212; just loads of money and a deep dark pain that he seeks to heal by helping Gotham, and hurting some bad guys on the way &#8212; speaks to a lot of people. He has become my favorite too. The only details I know about Batman are from the movies. I know that I like the new, darker reboot than the George Clooney movies but not much else. I asked my husband what comic books I should start with if I wanted to read the Batman series and he looked like a kid on Christmas. I haven’t had time to start yet, but I look forward to reading the original Batman stories.</p>
<p>Entering the world of comic books can be intimidating these days. Stories are everywhere about how “real geeks” are hazing the newcomers, especially women, who they believe lack the geek cred to belong to their club. Graphic novels have serious followings and while they are becoming more mainstream I still feel lost in that section of the bookstore. The fans aren’t always welcoming to people who don’t know what they’re doing. I want to start reading these stories and appreciating the fantastic artwork, but I’m not sure where to begin. My husband knows about traditional superhero comics but he is equally uneducated about the newer books.</p>
<p>I have <em>Maus I</em> and <em>II</em> and <em>The Complete Persepolis</em>, both are biographical graphic novels about dark periods in our history. <em>Maus</em> is the story of the author’s parents’ life in concentration camps during World War II. Art Spiegelman uses animals as the different races in the story. <em>Persepolis</em> is the story of Marjane Satrapi’s childhood in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. Neither are light reading. </p>
<p>I want to start out with something less intense, preferably fiction. But I need recommendations. Do I start with Batman, where I’m comfortable? Or the graphic novel version of <em>Game of Thrones</em> so I know the storyline already? I feel like I’ll be distracted by the pictures on the next page and knowing the story might help keep me from jumping ahead in the plot. Do I try Neil Gaiman’s <em>Sandman</em> series? I know I like the author already. Or should I start a new genre with a new author? I need help. Tell me where you started or wish you had started when reading comic books or graphic novels. I’m not really interested in manga, but maybe I will be after dipping a toe into this new world. I won’t rule out anything at this point.</p>
<p>Any advice is welcome, help a girl gain some geek cred! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One year into DC&#8217;s reboot of their primary continuity, known as the New 52, <em>Idler</em> comics writer Matt Santori-Griffith and co-editor Gavin Craig are taking stock of some of the high points. This week, at Gavin&#8217;s insistence, they&#8217;re starting things off by talking about <em>Batman</em> and <em>Batman and Robin</em>. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Jumping right in, have you noticed that both books start with Bruce being really sure of himself and his plan of attack (be it investigation into murder or raising a son) and both end the year with him not just realizing his own fallibility, but acknowledging the greater need for the family around him?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I think that making Bruce a bit more vulnerable, a bit more human, has been a really great move since the reboot. Even before the New 52, putting Dick Grayson in the cowl had already given us a Batman who struggled with his limitations, but it&#8217;s a big move to carry that over to Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It&#8217;s certainly part of the larger mission at DC this past year to humanize, not just youthen, its heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> It&#8217;s tempting to treat Batman as a section of the DC universe where not much has changed, but Scott Snyder in particular has shifted a lot of the assumptions that Batman operated under &#8212; even Dick&#8217;s history with the circus wasn&#8217;t what he thought it was.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> But what&#8217;s interesting about that is it&#8217;s not that the readers are getting a retrofitted history. We AND the characters are finding out new facts about the past that NEITHER of us knew before. Batman is as much in the dark as we are. Sure, the timeline is compressed, and minor details have been streamlined (*cough* Red Robin *cough*), but most of the assumptions we have had to date seem to bear out.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> And I think DC has done that pretty well. Compared to the various Crises, which were about streamlining or &#8220;fixing&#8221; continuity, I think the relaunch approach of preserving the core of what works, and shaking up the details has been really successful for storytelling. And the pacing has been magnificent. I remember &#8220;spoiling&#8221; the fact that Snyder was bringing Owlman into continuity in issue #10 of <em>Batman</em>, but that doesn&#8217;t even begin to sum up what Snyder did. It&#8217;s not just about re-introducing a somewhat obscure character, he really re-told Bruce&#8217;s family story (and Alfred&#8217;s) in a way that left everyone a bit shaken. Including me!</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I actually think what Snyder did to Alfred&#8217;s history was even more shocking than what he did to Bruce&#8217;s. In both books, Alfred is incredibly important, but that final story in <em>Batman</em> #11, where we get the truth about Jarvis Pennyworth&#8217;s demise, is so potent and makes Alfred much less of a caricature that he can sometimes become with less careful writers.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yeah, and to bring it back to your point about family, Alfred&#8217;s role as grandfather (of sorts) seems to be really important in both <em>Batman</em> and <em>Batman and Robin</em>. At times he seems to understand Damian Wayne a great deal better than Bruce does. I love the bit where he leaves two trackers on Damian so that Damian will think that he caught Alfred&#8217;s bit of sleight-of-hand.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That was brilliant. Bruce speaks of learning from 6 (not 4) mentors. I wonder if one of them is meant to be Alfred. But honestly, it makes sense that Alfred would understand Damian. He is his father&#8217;s son, and Alfred has already dealt with one hurt, scared 10 year-old Wayne son. Alfred has already done with Bruce exactly what Bruce needs to do with Damian, if Bruce can bring himself to realize it.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>  Coming back to the Court of Owls, the general presumption Bruce makes of his own infallibility isn&#8217;t just a character play (although it&#8217;s certainly interesting enough to be simply that). It also signals exactly how great a departure the New 52 is going to be for Batman moving forward. I feel like it&#8217;s easily been since the early 80s, maybe even the 70s, that we&#8217;ve had a Batman not just willing to admit he&#8217;s wrong, but most of the time, actually wrong. Even at his worst moments, say <em>Tower of Babel</em>, where he betrays all his friends, there&#8217;s still a moral high ground behind his mistake that makes it understandable. Here, though, he&#8217;s just plain wrong. It&#8217;s delightful, really.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I agree that it&#8217;s a great move, and long overdue. A Batman who wins every fight, who already knows everything is fundamentally uninteresting. There&#8217;s really just no way to tell stories about him. A Batman who finds himself having to look at his place in his city in an entirely new way, fighting an enemy who&#8217;d always been under his nose? That&#8217;s fascinating stuff. I love that Bruce actually has to return to the same house where he was trapped as a child to find the Court of Owls. It wasn&#8217;t that he was looking in the wrong place, it&#8217;s that he wasn&#8217;t ready to find them, and they weren&#8217;t ready to be found.</p>
<p>And I also think that Damian Wayne finally carving out his own place in the Bat-family has been really well done. Before the New 52, I wasn&#8217;t a big Damian fan. He just seemed like a bit of wish-fulfillment on Grant Morrison&#8217;s part, a cranky, violent Robin who allowed Morrison to flash-forward to his own take on who Batman should be. I think Tomasi in <em>Batman and Robin</em> has really given Damian room to both be the damaged angry person he is, but also found the insecure, vulnerable child that was always intended to be there, but that a lot of writers didn&#8217;t do a good job of conveying.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I think we saw flashes of that in Morrison&#8217;s <em>Batman and Robin</em>, but it never would have come out in the big brother/little brother dynamic that was Dick and Damian. Damian finally being confronted with having a relationship with his father, and vice versa, is a very distinctive premise upon which to set a book. It&#8217;s truly not Robin&#8217;s book any more than it is Batman&#8217;s. The &#8220;and&#8221; is really the star.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;ve said this before, but one of the things I most appreciate about Damian&#8217;s characterization is that he&#8217;s a ten year old kid who acts like a ten year old kid. Sure, he&#8217;s been trained by the best assassins in the world and has genes that could make Alexander look unambitious, but at his root, he doesn&#8217;t act the way an adult would. I find that very unusual for teen (or tween as the case may be) heroes. I can barely think of any that don&#8217;t just seem like mini-adults.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Indeed! I know you and I don&#8217;t always agree on Tim Drake, and he&#8217;s always been a wildly different character than Damian, in ways both good and bad. I think we&#8217;re starting to get some really interesting tracing of the differences between the various Robins, and Bruce&#8217;s different successes and failures with each.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Absolutely. Tim Drake, for example, is also the one who had a father and wanted a second one, when Damian never even got a chance at one until now. I can see how to a ten-year-old, that might seem greedy. And that&#8217;s what I think so many people who deride Damian are missing. He&#8217;s not a jerk for no reason. He&#8217;s a fucked up little kid with a crazy mother, a grandfather who wanted to steal his body, and a missing dad who dies the minute they meet. Duh.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The art on both titles has also just been outstanding. I really love the way that <em>Batman and Robin</em> gives its artwork space to do a lot of the storytelling. You have some really great or even iconic moments that are just images. I&#8217;m thinking of Damian killing the bat in #2.</p>

<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Gleason&#8217;s art in <em>Batman and Robin</em> definitely has a more open feel to it than Capullo&#8217;s in <em>Batman</em>, although the latter certainly reflects the tightly wound existence that Bruce lives out.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <em>Batman</em> is SO text-heavy. It almost always works (I think #11 pushes it), but Snyder&#8217;s doing a lot of heavy lifting with the narration and dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> The monologue in <em>Batman</em> is strong. I don&#8217;t mind it so much because the art is crisp and every line just so well chosen. And honestly, I like a book that takes me more than 3 minutes to read. I spend a ton of money every month on these things. Breezing through a stack in 30 minutes is somewhat of a rip-off.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> So, what about Harper Row? Where does she fit in? And what about <em>Batman</em> #12?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> <em>Batman</em> #12 is just extraordinary. Art, story, everything.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> Here&#8217;s where my head was the day <em>Batman</em> #12 was released: I&#8217;m not sure I can even explain why I&#8217;ve been so especially sensitive to the news lately. It may have started with the midnight shooting at <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. Maybe it&#8217;s just the election cycle, but I&#8217;ve found myself getting tension headaches every time I read another hyper-conservative twist on either gay marriage or civil liberties or the lack of acknowledgement of the role race plays in media reportage. . . whatever. The final straw was the spokesperson for the American Family Association advocating that its members kidnap children from gay parented families in an act of liberty that would mirror the &#8220;Underground Railroad.&#8221; I was so angry and hurt I truly don&#8217;t know how I drove home from work without getting in an accident.</p>
<p>And then I read <em>Batman</em> #12.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, reading a comic where Batman kicks the ass of a bunch of gay bashers. It was moving. Telling the story in DC&#8217;s absolute top-selling book? Made me a little teary-eyed. That it wasn&#8217;t a media event (intended or not) that could be accused of cashing in? Got a little more emotional. But the part that finally made me actually shed tears was the portrayal of a sister so devoted to her brother, and so determined to stand proud for him, that she&#8217;d shave the word FAG in the back of her own head. And then she wanted to help Batman too. If she&#8217;s not a fricking hero already with one single issue, I don&#8217;t know who is.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I know you&#8217;ve done <a href="http://www.comicosity.com/crisis-of-epic-proportion-the-case-of-alan-scott/" target="_blank">some writing about Alan Scott</a> in <em>Earth 2</em> (and you constantly make me feel bad for not reading that title. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out what I can give up to increase my comics budget), and there&#8217;s something about having both a headline-grabbing, totally visible mainstream gay character AND having a story like Harper and Cullen Row in <em>Batman</em> #12. <em>USA Today</em> isn&#8217;t going to cover it, but it&#8217;s every bit as visible, and it&#8217;s about the fact that DC does both, not one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That&#8217;s a really good point about their commitment to this area. DC gets a lot of shit for a lot of stuff, and I acknowledge that 30 years of reading them every week has made me into somewhat of an apologist when things go south for them in the PR department. But I can see how hard they&#8217;re trying, especially to reflect gay and lesbian issues in their comics. And it feels like it&#8217;s being handled very differently. I don&#8217;t know if it just seems more organic, but Cullen&#8217;s introduction seems far more natural than Terry Berg&#8217;s in <em>Green Lantern</em> all those years ago. I particularly enjoyed Cullen&#8217;s almost fanboy fawning over Tim Drake (and not even Red Robin in this case). It was cute, and how could that have been in a book 5 years ago?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Yes! I became Cullen&#8217;s biggest fan when he started talking about Tim. FINALLY someone understands. I think there&#8217;s a real role for Harper Row to fill, especially if part of Snyder&#8217;s take is that Batman is more estranged from his city than he realizes. She&#8217;s literally on (and under) the ground. And the active Bat-family NEEDS some estrogen. Barbara Gordon and Kate Kane are doing great things, but the Batcave itself is starting to smell a bit like dude.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That&#8217;s an excellent point. I love the idea too that not every hero has to wear a costume in Gotham. And yes, that&#8217;s part of the reason, though, that I am surprised about her overwhelmingly positive fan reaction. I mostly expected the response to be, &#8220;But she&#8217;s not Cass or Stephanie.&#8221; Why do you think she resonated despite that?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Harper didn&#8217;t really make an impression on me until #12 (she really just has a brief cameo or two previously), but I&#8217;m not sure that Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown&#8217;s fan base necessarily overlaps with the general Bat fan base. That is, there are some vocal people who miss Cass and Steph, but there are a whole lot of Bat fans who don&#8217;t. And looking back, even in her cameo, Harper is self-possessed in a way that Steph in particular never was. Steph is a fuck-up who was just starting to find herself in Bryan Q. Miller&#8217;s <em>Batgirl</em> series. Harper has a sort of self-deprecation, but she also used a car battery and jumper cables as a defibrillator. You have to admit, that&#8217;s kind of cool. I love Cass and Steph, but Cass is stunted, and Steph, at her worst, is a loser. Harper is neither, which makes her something of a rarity as a possible female member of the Bat family.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> That. Is an excellent way to put that &#8212; self-possessed. She doesn&#8217;t seem to have much self-doubt or self-consciousness, which makes her very attractive to me as a character. Now here&#8217;s a curious question: why do I find Harper so compelling, but other teen characters who act older than their natural age I find unrealistic? Is it because she&#8217;s female?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Well, exactly how old is Harper? She&#8217;s in high school but works for the city electric department</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> She seemed about 16-17 to me.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> She falls a bit into that mini-adult category, but an awesome story covers many flaws.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> I find it fascinating that Snyder seems as interested in reincorporating past elements long left behind in the Batman legend as Morrison is.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> It&#8217;s a great move. So much was just left in the dustbin after the mid-1980s.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> And maybe that&#8217;s a good thought to end on. Does the New 52 enable this type of retro-history more than a continuity that seemingly tries to rationalize or retro-remove anything that doesn&#8217;t fit perfectly?</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> The DC universe is a rather uniquely cobbled-together thing, and <a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2011/7029" target="_blank">probably not particularly suited to a totally smooth, consistent history</a> (if such a thing is even possible for mass serial storytelling). I think it&#8217;s not an accident that we&#8217;re not seeing much effort within the new continuity to smooth all the edges. Rather than worrying about continuity in and of itself, it&#8217;s really useful to just free your writers every now and then, and I think that&#8217;s the big thing the New 52 has done.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> It&#8217;s certainly paid off for Batman. While historical details may not have changed that much, the tenor of the books in this family has. We&#8217;re not seeing a god-like Batman anymore. Bruce is very much human, even in his most arrogant moments, and that has never been executed as well to date as Snyder and Tomasi are.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Bruce needed some reinvigorating, and even before the New 52, I think that&#8217;s what Morrison in particular tried to do. But Snyder and Tomasi have really pulled the best of what was good, and brought in some great new ideas of their own. I&#8217;m a big Batman fanatic regardless, but he&#8217;s worth reading now as a character with desires and failings. He&#8217;s someone you can tell stories about and not just around. Bruce, after all, is a bit of a jerk, and when you can acknowledge that, then things can really get cooking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a little kid, probably about six or seven years old, I had this recurring nightmare: A tall thin man would float outside my second floor bedroom window. He was always dressed in a black business suit, and had a gaunt profile with thinning white hair. I could never quite make out his features through the slats of the window blinds. Bright golden sunlight would stream into my room from behind him, rendering me completely immobile as he watched. And he would just laugh and laugh and laugh.</p>
<p>Even typing those words today give me chills like you wouldn’t believe.</p>
<p>There’s something so utterly creepy about the simplest imagery that just roots into a little kid’s mind and soul. Never once in my dreams did this bogey man try to grab me or even pass through my window. He had no bloody hand, clown mask or giant scythe with which to threaten me. There was a stare and laughter. His <em>presence</em> was enough to startle me awake, and that sort of palpable atmosphere of fear is difficult to translate into words, much less pictures.</p>
<p>Difficult, but clearly not impossible. Horror comics are nothing new, stretching back in popularity to post-World War II America. Genuine terrors seen abroad made way for tales to titillate young readers, with gruesome fates being meted out every month. Where a bulk of comics (or movies, or books, or video games) since may have fallen short is in overemphasizing the literal. We’ve all read stories where the monstrous form of a child’s nightmare takes physical shape, splashing blood and brain matter across the page as if it were errant paint on a canvas. Gore may rile the senses, but the subtlety of a bogey man that looks like everyone else, who passes through life unnoticed except to his victims, generates a far more permanent effect. When only YOU can see or feel the horror that is coming to get you &#8212; and the panic starts to wiggle almost unnoticeably beneath the skin of your arms and belly &#8212; that’s when true fear starts to set in.</p>
<p>No one knows this better than Scott Snyder. Co-writing with Scott Tuft, Snyder delivers <em>Severed</em>, a prime example of just how terrifying the bogey man can be &#8212; especially if he looks just like every one else. Published in 2011 by Image Comics, this seven issue series flashes back on the story of 12 year-old Jack, who has run away from home in 1916 to find his long-lost father. Eager to find a sense of his own identity out on the road, Jack quickly falls in with a traveling companion named Sam, as well as an older mentor figure who just happened to eat the last boy he retrieved from an Illinois orphanage. Adopting the name Alan Fisher from the man he just killed for it, Snyder and Tuft’s bogeyman casually comes upon the pair in the park as Jack plays his violin for coins. He looks every bit like a man two kids without a roof over their heads could trust. So when &#8220;Alan&#8221; offers the pair food and a few beers back at his place, Jack agrees without hesitation.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10451" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/30/bogey-men/severed1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg" data-orig-size="640,485" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Severed1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=485" alt="Severed" title="Severed1" width="640" height="485" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10451" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=227 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Having just left the secure comfort of his adopted home, Jack is not prepared for the horrors that have been awaiting him out in the cold. That said, Alan is at his most terrifying when his hand is comforting and his appearance remains thoroughly banal. Attila Futaki’s illustrative style draws a brilliant balance between the everyday and uncanny as he moves the camera’s eye from panel to panel. Much of the true horror of Alan’s threat is ever unseen, only alluded to in a plate of chicken bones, or reserved for large single page reveals. Moment to moment, Futaki maintains the characters’ bearings with calm line and subdued environments &#8212; as if to render a certain artificial calmness about their interactions.</p>
<p>As a result, we witness Alan’s demeanor to be so compellingly trustworthy to Jack that even bringing out an enormous bear-trap to the dining room table seems no more suspicious than any other party game. And to some degree, we momentarily trust as well. Certainly Jack is desperate for a father figure, so it’s understandable that he would simultaneously be drawn to a man who could fill that role and assist him in locating his actual father. But the further along this road Jack travels, the more we’re left hanging on the edge of our seats in anticipation for an inevitable, terrifying reveal. We know the teeth have been removed, but what lies beyond them is where the truly frightful awaits.</p>
<p>Similarly, Snyder also introduces an exceptionally chilling bogey man in the form of James Gordon Jr. in the collected tale <em>Batman: The Black Mirror</em>. Completing original publication from DC Comics’ monthly Detective Comics in 2011 as well, <em>Black Mirror</em> centers on the return of the long lost son of perennial Batman associate Commissioner Gordon. Far from a happy reunion, James Jr. is met with hesitation and dread, for his reemergence from the shadows outside Gotham City means investigations of the past are reopened &#8212; suspicions of his true culpability behind a childhood disappearance still weigh heavily on his family.</p>

<p>Even more than in the obscured bogey man of <em>Severed</em>, Snyder develops an antagonist in James Jr. that leaves the reader guessing at every turn. We are no more sure than the Commissioner of his son’s guilt as the story evolves. Having been considered odd from the youngest age &#8212; seemingly devoid of emotion even as an infant &#8212; James Jr. appears to epitomize the profile for Batman’s more traditional, psychologically challenging foes. Yet his calm demeanor and easily explained activities make for a much more ambiguous villain. James Jr. is Gotham’s usual psychopathic terror turned inside out, an internalized horror well contained in contrast with the usual externalized embodiment of chaos and misery. Likewise, James Jr. is also an inversion of the standard bogey man mythology in that he is originally a child who is feared by adults, not the other way around. When a friend of Barbara Gordon (the Commissioner’s more famous and heroic progeny) goes missing after calling young James Jr. “creepy,” Barbara’s suspicions immediately go towards her brother, but their father remains torn even fifteen years later. This is the power of the bogey man, not only to terrorize, but to convince the world at the very same time he doesn’t actually exist.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10453" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/30/bogey-men/james2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james2.jpeg" data-orig-size="640,395" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="James2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james2.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james2.jpeg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james2.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=395" alt="James and Barbara" title="James2" width="640" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10453" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james2.jpeg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james2.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=93 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/james2.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=185 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Sharing artistic duties in this volume with the remarkable talent Jock, Francesco Francavilla illustrates most of the story Snyder lays out for James Jr., from his arrival on video at the Gotham aviary to his ultimate confrontation with his much less conflicted sister. At times Francavilla depicts James Jr. as a hovering monster, whose opaque red glasses imply deeply disturbing thoughts ready to manifest themselves with the flick of a wrist. For most of the narrative, however, the artist maintains the same terrible sense of banality we see in <em>Severed</em>, but in flattened day-glo tones that scream danger without having to depict it literally. So little of Gotham is ever seen in daylight, but even at night, James Jr. remains more thoroughly darkened than would otherwise &#8212; his own shadow even extending over the faces of his more illuminated family members as they interact or discuss his condition.</p>
<p>Scott Snyder and his collaborators have managed to craft on paper that indescribable unease we often can only experience in dreams, or if terribly unlucky, in real life. It’s been over 30 years since I dreamed of that floating man outside my bedroom window. While I may still shiver recalling the vision, I’m pretty confident those nightmares won’t be returning to involuntarily taunt my adult brain. Whether there will soon be another bogey man lined up to replace him? Of that, I am now less sure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>That is, I&#8217;m not quite done, but I&#8217;m <em>done</em>.</p>
<p>I own several of the Traveler&#8217;s Tales LEGO video games. I&#8217;ve played the first two <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games on my GameCube. I unlocked all of the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Jedi on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. I played <em>LEGO Batman</em> on my Playstation 2. I unlocked all the characters, collected all of the mini-kits, earned True Hero or True Villain on every level, and unlocked all of the bonuses. And now that I&#8217;ve played <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> on my Playstation 3, I think I can safely ignore <em>LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars</em>, and <em>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean</em>. </p>
<p>In fact, I don&#8217;t think I need to play a LEGO video game ever again.</p>

Annoying in the book. Annoying in the game.</p></div> According to <em>LEGO Harry Potter</em>&#8216;s completion stats, I&#8217;m 98.7% done. I&#8217;ve earned True Wizard on every level, collected all 20 of red bonus bricks, all 24 of the house crest pieces, unlocked 166 of the 167 characters, rescued 49 of the 50 students in peril, and collected 198 of the 200 gold bricks. Even for all this, I&#8217;m closer to done than it sounds. And further away. You earn a gold block for rescuing students, so I actually have just one student and one more gold brick to find. Finding all 200 gold bricks unlocks a bonus level, where I&#8217;d find the final character, Lord Voldemort. So I have just three tasks left to complete. Except that I can&#8217;t find that last student in peril, or that last gold brick. I&#8217;ve even consulted the cheat guides, but there are just too many students in peril, and too many gold bricks. I&#8217;m not sure which one of each is the one I&#8217;m missing, so I don&#8217;t know what to go looking for. I&#8217;ve tried to systematically make my way through Hogwarts, but clearly I&#8217;m missing something. And there&#8217;s a substantial amount of time involved in walking again through Hogwarts, with its many twists and turns, in anything resembling a thorough fashion.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not fun.</p>
<p>In another game, that might be less of a criticism. In another game, the rewards would be set up differently. I might need to spend more time grinding to bring my characters up to a level where they&#8217;re strong enough to explore a new area without getting killed, but the payoff would be new weapons and armor, new side quests and new storylines. I might have to keep practicing until I could jump and grab and balance just right, but the reward would be access to a new level with new challenges.</p>
<p>In the LEGO games, the only reward is the sense of completion. Lord Voldemort may be the final character, but within the LEGO games, all the members of a particular character class are pretty much identical, except for the aesthetics. There&#8217;s nothing that Lord Voldemort can do that any other dark wizard can&#8217;t do, except to earn me a couple of trophies. (Which again, give you nothing but bragging rights and a sense of completion.)</p>

Or those white pants?</p></div>
<p>Even worse, when you do finally complete the game, there&#8217;s literally nothing else to do. Once you have 100% and all the trophies, there&#8217;s no reason to come back and keep playing. You really may as well just sell the game.</p>
<p>And at least for me, there&#8217;s something wrong with that. I <em>want</em> to have a reason to keep my old games on the shelf. It appeals to the collector in me. But as obsessive as I am, I still can&#8217;t justify holding on to a game where there&#8217;s actually less reason to play through a level once you&#8217;ve done it the first time. It&#8217;s still fun to ride around the Old West as John (or Jack) Marston. It&#8217;s still fun to solve the puzzles in <em>Portal</em> and <em>Portal 2</em>, and to stumble on a line of dialogue from GLaDOS or Wheatley that you missed the first time through. Once you&#8217;ve found all the hidden items in the LEGO games, however, they&#8217;re gone, so while most of the levels are designed to require at least two playthroughs to find all the bonus items, there&#8217;s no incentive to keep coming back. There&#8217;s actually less to each level than there was the first time through.</p>
<p>It may be part of the problem that I&#8217;m a <em>Harry Potter</em> fan, and the somewhat humorously mimed version of the storyline in the games actually impedes enjoyment of the game. It may be that the <em>Star Wars</em> movies were ripe for some light parody, and there are enough campy takes on the <em>Batman</em> rogues&#8217; gallery that the silly, over-the-top feel of the LEGO version seemed like a good fit. But the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe, as it develops, becomes much, much darker. Without that sense of genuine menace, there&#8217;s little reason to watch as several hundred pages of character and plot are crammed into a few minutes of animated charades.</p>
<p>More than anything else, my gameplay has become pathological. I&#8217;m searching and searching for those last few items just because I&#8217;m so close to that magical but totally arbitrary 100%. I&#8217;m frustrated, and I&#8217;m just wasting time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not having any fun.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t need to do that.</p>
<p>Unless they make another <em>Batman</em> game. . .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things to come out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;and there were a number of great things that came out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;was the character of Renee Montoya. As a uniformed patrolwoman, Montoya starts off as the smart, straight-laced junior foil to the self-serving, corner-cutting, Batman-hating Detective Harvey Bullock. They&#8217;re both good cops in the end, but while Bullock will lie to cover his own ass and resents Batman for making him look ineffective, Montoya is honest, honorable, and knows that Batman is the same. When the series got a redesign, Montoya got a promotion to detective, and was partnered with Bullock. The comics, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t have much use for Montoya as a uniform, so DC made her a detective and partnered her with Bullock in her very first appearance. She&#8217;s put to great use in the extended &#8220;No Man&#8217;s Land&#8221; storyline, but really comes into her own when the Gotham City Police Department is given its chance to shine in the short-lived but absolutely wonderful <em>Gotham Central</em>.</p>
<p><em>Gotham Central</em> ran from 2003 to 2006, and Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka traded off storylines for the entirety of that run. While <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s fan base was (and is) avid, it was never large, which is something of a crime. The writing and art in <em>Gotham Central</em> are pitch-perfect. The characters are put-upon, overworked, and worst of all in a city like Gotham, honest. Brubaker and Rucka did a difficult thing in an extraordinary way by telling stories that seem exactly the right size in a normally hyper-colored, overexcited universe. (Check out the Teen Titans cameo in the &#8220;Dead Robin&#8221; storyline. It&#8217;s perfectly done.) If you&#8217;re the sort of person who claims to love Batman stories because of the human dimension&mdash;where Batman is just a man pushed to do incredible things at the edge of human (and not superhuman) ability&mdash;then <em>Gotham Central</em> will either give you what you never realized you had always been looking for, or it will call you out as a liar. The Batman is the superhuman presence in these pages, always a force for good, but not always on the cops&#8217; side, as they are well aware.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4433" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4433" data-attachment-id="4433" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/16/the-badges-behind-the-bat/ma0511-2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg" data-orig-size="1140,941" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ma0511" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=300&#038;h=247" alt="Batman in action" title="ma0511" width="300" height="247" class="size-medium wp-image-4433" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=300&amp;h=247 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=598&amp;h=494 598w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511.jpg?w=150&amp;h=124 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4433" class="wp-caption-text">Batman in action</p></div> In the pages of <em>Gotham Central</em>, Batman is almost a wraith, only occasionally present, and even then wrapped in constant darkness. You almost never see him in action, and even when you do, you don&#8217;t really see him so much as see the effect of what he just did.</p>
<p>On a side note, the series really do a good job of portraying that darkness as something the Batman himself <em>does</em>. There&#8217;s a scene in a later issue where a detective accidentally shoots Batman, and when he&#8217;s laying unconscious on the floor, he&#8217;s just a man in a belt and a cape. As you can see, he gets better.</p>
<p>Death is a troublesome thing in mainstream comic books, and <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s treatment of death is one of the best measures of the title&#8217;s success. As much as comic books would like to tell you that they&#8217;ve grown up, mortality is usually dealt with in a manner that is at best adolescent: Major characters survive against incredible odds while minor characters and extras, in the worst hands, are used as cannon fodder&mdash;a way to titilate the reader and pretend to raise the dramatic stakes by splashing the page with day-glo red. The Batman comics are not immune from this, and a particularly awful recent example can be found in the 3-issue <em>Batman/Darkest Night</em> tie-in miniseries. Darkest Night was a DC-wide crossover event where, um, you know Green Lantern? It turns out there are &#8220;lanterns&#8221; for every color in the spectrum. Just go with it. In Darkest Night you find out there are Black Lanterns, too. Who raise the dead to kill people. And stuff. Anyway, it&#8217;s a very un-Batman, cosmic story, but they did a Batman tie-in anyway. It starts with dead Batman villains raised as Black Lanterns who attack the police department and kill a bunch of cops. Jim and Barbara Gordon get away, because they&#8217;re the only people who really matter, but dozens of nameless uniforms are slaughtered. In all honesty, it&#8217;s offensive. Not because it&#8217;s excessive violence, but because it&#8217;s stupid violence. Every uniformed officer in those pages may as well be wearing a red uniform on an old episode of <em>Star Trek</em>. They exist only to be killed, and in my mind, that&#8217;s lazy, sadistic writing. It makes me feel worse about humanity for reading it, and not in a <a target="new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels#Part_IV:_A_Voyage_to_the_Country_of_the_Houyhnhnms">Gulliver&#8217;s Travels/Houyhnhnm</a> kind of way, but in an I&#8217;m-not-sure-why-I-bother-to-read-comics-anyway kind of way.</p>

That&#039;s right. Page four.</p></div> There are several significant deaths in <em>Gotham Central</em>, and Commisioner Atkins (you read that right) is criticized at one point for having a far higher fatality rate in the Major Crimes Unit than Gordon did. (Gordon, at the time, was retired. He&#8217;s since returned to the job.) Every fatality in <em>Gotham Central</em>, however, matters. They affect the entire unit, and they&#8217;re painful to read because in every case they happen to a character who is made to feel like a person, and not just a plot point. Detective Charlie Fields is murdered by Mr. Freeze on the fourth page of the first issue&mdash;and he&#8217;s killed hard, by the way. Freeze knocks apart Fields&#8217; frozen body in front of his partner&mdash;meaning that Fields isn&#8217;t given much time to become a character on his own, but his death haunts not just the next few issues, but the rest of the series.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4436" style="width: 305px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4436" data-attachment-id="4436" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/16/the-badges-behind-the-bat/ma0511-1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg" data-orig-size="495,503" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ma0511-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=295" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=495" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=295&#038;h=300" alt="Montoya and Allen" title="ma0511-1" width="295" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-4436" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=295&amp;h=300 295w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg?w=148&amp;h=150 148w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/ma0511-1.jpg 495w" sizes="(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4436" class="wp-caption-text">Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen</p></div> The heart of the series, at least for me, is Renee Montoya, her relationship with her partner, Crispus Allen, and the way it all falls apart. By the time <em>Gotham Central</em> takes place, Renee Montoya has survived No Man&#8217;s Land, in which Gotham City was abandoned to anarchy after an earthquake destroyed most of the city, but she&#8217;s a character on the edge, watching good people get hurt and die around her, and ostracized by the department and her family when she&#8217;s outed by a lesbian. (By Two-Face, who still has a thing for her after No Man&#8217;s Land. Just go read it.) Everything comes to a head when Allen is murdered by a corrupt cop, Jim Corrigan, who gets away with it. Montoya, who has been less and less in control of her anger over the course of the series, bursts into Corrigan&#8217;s apartment in a drunken rage, beats his girlfriend (who is also a cop) unconscious, and puts a gun to Corrigan&#8217;s head. In itself, it&#8217;s a rather clichéd officer-on-the-edge revenge scene, but the muted artwork and the relationship between Montoya, Allen, and the reader that Brubaker and Rucka have built over the course of the previous thirty-some issues really raise the scene a level above your average mainstream comic book.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Gotham Central</em> wasn&#8217;t perfect, and wasn&#8217;t a great fit for the DC universe, as a rather awkward Infinite Crisis tie-in issue demonstrates. Overworked detectives make for great noir/procedural stories, but not as much for cosmic/mystical/end-of-the-world stuff. (Interestingly, or painfully, both Montoya and Allen have taken big superhero turns since the end of <em>Gotham Central</em>. Montoya worked on her martial arts and meditation skills to become The Question, and Allen became the new superviolent mystical incarnation of The Spectre. Rucka still writes Montoya admirably as The Question, but Allen was such a great cop character, it&#8217;s a bit sad to see him miscast and largely ignored as The Spectre.) It is however, a great demonstration (along with work like <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/16/watching-the-detectives/">Sam and Twitch</a>), that the police noir-procedural is an amazingly underutilized genre in the comic book world. We need more of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always loved Batman. Always. Once of the greatest thrills I have encountered as a parent has been my son’s love of Batman. It sure seems easier now to be a fan at a young age, what with all the cartoons on the tube or the toys at the fast food joints. For this last Halloween my son went as Batman. Not only did he dress as Batman, but his costume was sewn by my mom, who made my own Batman costume 28 years ago. In the midst of my Bat-fandom of the late 80s was the first Batman film since the 60s, Tim Burton’s simply-titled <em>Batman</em>. Bat-merch was everywhere in 1989. I bought my first pair of Chuck Taylor shoes that summer, with the Batman logo all over the shoes. They were dope and they were stolen out of my car that summer. Apart from the shoes the other notable thing to me was the music from the movie. I vividly remember tuning in to 92.1 The Ape around six in the morning and hearing Prince’s new song from the film, &#8220;Batdance.&#8221; Loved it. I remember going to Wherehouse Records and buying the cassette single and listening to it until the soundtrack was released. I bought the soundtrack by Prince AND the score by Danny Eflman. I listened to them all the time.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgq3UaATX_U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Somehow listening to this music made sense as the one initial thing I remember about Batman was the theme song from the original, Adam West film in the 1960s. You can’t miss it and you can’t forget it. Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na BATMAN! There is a version of that theme on YouTube where <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vHGnKZgmlk">a pug says Batman</a>. My son loves it and this appears to be what YouTube was created for. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmxwHr57C1Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Enough interruptions, let&#8217;s get back to the Batman theme. When Jack was beginning to get into Batman I played him the song in the first version I could think of, the version by The Who. Released in 1966 on the <em>Ready Steady Who</em> EP, the version by The Who isn’t too different from the TV version. It might be a bit more amped up, a bit more thrashy, a bit more ‘Oo. One could argue that their version becomes the standard as the next time I remember hearing a comparable version comes from The Jam, who covered it on their debut LP <em>In The City</em> in 1977. As the Jam were dedicated Mods their version was really just the Who version in newer clothes. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXmPEsuipUw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I see the song as one of those garage rock totems, the type of song that is easy to learn and easy to play and perfect. It is up there with &#8220;Road Runner&#8221; and &#8220;Stepping Stone&#8221; as one of the formative, first songs your band would learn to play. And there is nothing wrong with that in my mind, better to have something that is easy to perfect. The world would be boring if everyone could cover Emerson Lake and Palmer songs. </p>
<p>Now what I’m gonna write about here has something to do with Batman but not in the way you think. In 1966 there was a record associated with the original Batman TV series, a record entitled <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> and credited to The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale. The record is total 60s dancey pop, real cheap soul music created to make the kids dance. But there is something different about this LP, something that takes it, well, that takes it to Mars. That difference is one Herman Poole Blount otherwise known as Sun Ra. Sun Ra! Playing Hammond B-3. And what a difference he makes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-mDUzqPLRU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>While completely Bat-themed with song titles referring to specific characters in the series or events that would set the show’s mood they have nothing to do with Batman. There is not one bit of music that you would remember from the old TV show. Nothing on the record relates to the series except for the theme song. The versions I mentioned before by The Who and The Jam rocked. This version swings. Hard.  The first sound you hear is a drone on the organ, then the drums and then the horns. And the swing just gets you, hits you right where you dance.  A gaggle of soulful sisters sing the lyrics and that organ shines, punching through the songs and adding so much. Coupled with the punchy horn section and you have the classic. This is the song to watch go-go dancers dance to, a song for groovy cats and kittens to swing and shimmy to. I can’t get enough of it. </p>
<p>The Batman theme is much like the Spider-Man theme, a brief moment of song that will continue to become a relic due to the superceding versions of product that are released in the name of the character. There is no soundtrack to Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. The music in <em>The Dark Knight</em> is atonal and high pitched, nothing with a traditional melody. I doubt it will be any different during the third installment of the film. If anything, Batman is now a character that allows for no levity. The films, the video games (best comic video game I’ve ever played is <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>), everything related to Batman has an undertone of decay. I love it, don’t get me wrong, but one does find oneself missing the camp every now and again. </p>
<p>When I listen to this record, I really miss the lightness that was originally bundled within the Batman franchise. Before Michael Keaton, Joel Schumacher, before Bat-nipples, before Christian Bale, and before Val Kilmer there was a show that embraced the happy go luckiness of the times and produced something that fit within that present day. Can our times really have gotten so much darker? And if the mood changed would the music?</p>
<p>Who knows? I’m happy to have had Batman in my life for all these years, I get a kick out of my son being into the character and I eagerly await the next installment in the Arkham video game series. Whenever I get into a Bat-mood I will whip on this CD and just let the joy take over and feel like a kid again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Batman first appeared in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/02/they-knew-it-was-batman-week/" target="_blank"><em>Detective Comics</em> #27 in 1939</a>.  Since then he has been called The Bat-Man, the Caped Crusader, the World’s Greatest Detective and the Dark Knight, amongst other names. He is a character that has been lent to as many interpretations as nicknames (more, actually) over the years and has graced the silver screen no less than eight times, not including the upcoming <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> (2012), but certainly including the only animated theatrical release, <em>Mask of the Phantasm</em> (1993). In those eight films, Batman has fallen under the direction of Leslie H. Martinson, Tim Burton, Eric Radonski and Bruce Timm, Joel Schumacher, and Christopher Nolan, each adding their own interpretations to the Batman mythos, and with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman: The Movie" src="https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B63R5GNGL.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="285" />Leslie H. Martinson, for example, brought us <em><strong>Batman: the Movie</strong></em> (1966) (BAM!) a camp-schlock extravaganza (POW!) starring Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin (KERFUFFLE?). The film, which grew out of the 60’s TV series, concerns Batman’s primary rogues gallery (the Joker, the Riddler, the Penguin and Catwoman) joining forces in a fiendish plot to. . . dehydrate people. Yes, fiendish. It contains some truly brilliant moments, including Batman fending off a shark attack with his handy bat-shark-repellent and a delightful little game of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUGCQXLq9wk" target="_blank">free association</a> culminating in Batman, Robin, and the Commissioner miraculously (and hilariously) uncovering just who is behind this fiendish (soooo fiendish) plot to give everyone cotton mouth. The only thing more fun than watching this nonsense is listening to the DVD commentary provided by the dynamic duo of delusion, West and Ward themselves! (KAPLOOEY!)</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Batman '89" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.batman-movies.com/images/batman-movies/batman-movie-poster-5.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="277" />Tim Burton stepped up to the plate with his own darker version of the Batman in 1989’s lazily titled <em><strong>Batman</strong></em>, with an unlikely Michael Keaton pulling on the cowl in the title role. Keaton, while a bit older and more quirky than the Bruce Wayne we&#8217;ve come to expect, manages to fit pretty nicely into Burton’s more stylized, film noir Gotham City. And although Burton has done away with much of the campiness of the 60’s series, <em>Batman</em>&#8216;s often over-the-top dialog and repeated use of Dutch camera angles definitely hints at a certain fondness for the bat-camp of the past. Jack Nicholson’s Joker is certainly more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjiIHfKwi0Q" target="_blank">Cesar Romero</a> than Heath Ledger (More to come on that).</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman Returns" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.globalwebcasters.com/images/divx/batman-returns.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="272" />As is often the case when a director is allowed to do more than one entry into a series, Burton’s second dance with the devil in the pale moonlight was a bit too much of a good thing. <em><strong>Batman Returns</strong></em>, released in 1992, featured some even sillier dialog, a lamer villain (the Penguin, eh? Oh, and he controls real penguins? AND he’s played by Danny Devito?!), a slightly cooler villain (Christopher Walken, simultaneously adding and subtracting from the film with his weirdness), a purrrfectly over-the-top Catwoman (I don’t care what anyone says, I don’t like this character and Michelle Pfieffer did little to change that) and even Dutchier Dutch camera angles! Keaton is given little to do but wade through the weird.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Mask of the Phantasm" src="https://i2.wp.com/images.wikia.com/dcanimated/images/2/24/Batman_Mask_of_the_Phantasm.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="275" />In 1993 directors Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm brought an animated Batman to the silver screen for the first time with <em><strong>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</strong></em>. Drawing from the phenomenal animated series, <em>Mask</em> was a fine entry into the filmography, but was largely ignored by moviegoers outside of the series’ fans. Mark Hamill (Yes, THAT Mark Hamill) always seems to be having a great time as the voice of the Joker and I’ve long held the opinion that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3zJxF-0N3Y">Kevin Conroy’s Batman voice</a> should totally be overdubbed into Christian Bale’s lozenge craving throat.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman Forever" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.exotica.org.uk/mediawiki/files/thumb/d/da/Batman_Forever_(dvd_cover).jpg/300px-Batman_Forever_(dvd_cover).jpg" alt="" width="180" height="242" />Speaking of too much of a good thing, that’s exactly how Joel Schumacher started his bat-reign with 1995’s <em><strong>Batman Forever</strong></em>. Taking the baby-step backwards that would lead to the giant leap (see below), <em>Forever</em> built upon Burton’s silliness while disregarding most of the noir element that helped make the silliness more palatable. The shadows were replaced with brightly colored gel lighting and the villains became larger than life. It’s not a terrible film, but it’s certainly not a good one either. Val Kilmer is, in my opinion, the most bland and forgettable of all the Batmen, and we are finally (and regrettably) introduced to Robin, played with unfortunate zeal by Chris O’Donnell.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Batman and Robin" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman26robin.jpg?w=175&#038;h=268" alt="" width="175" height="268" />Schumacher followed it up by throwing a rock into the bat signal with <em><strong>Batman and Robin</strong></em> (1997), a ridiculous spectacle that would play quite nicely as a sequel to Martinson’s ’66 film. Remember when I mentioned Val Kilmer being the most bland and forgettable Batman? George Clooney should be so lucky. He’s officially the worst Batman of the bunch, although, to his credit he is quite aware of that fact as he has publicly blamed himself for &#8220;single-handedly destroying the franchise.&#8221; Bless his heart. Because I think Clooney&#8217;s too classy to, I&#8217;ll plop some blame for his unfortunate portrayal into Schumacher&#8217;s lap as well. Couple that with another dose of Robin’s inanity, the introduction of Batgirl, Uma Thurman’s ham sandwich performance as Poison Ivy and Schwartzenegger’s nightmare puns as Mr. Freeze (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRH-Ywpz1_I" target="_blank">Everybody chill</a>!) and you’ve got Batman on Broadway with the Andrew Lloyd Weber tunes traded for a few bat-nipples.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman Begins" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.gamexchanger.co.uk/images/B000B73GYE/main.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="300" />Then, in 2005, Christopher Nolan brought us <em><strong>Batman Begins</strong></em>. Dark, realistic and intelligent, the film takes Batman to places not yet explored outside of the comic book sphere. It is the first of the films to really take any time with Bruce Wayne, here portrayed by Christian Bale as a determined, haunted man. The loss of his parents and, in particular, his father has led him to confront his fears and eventually embody them. And even though the handling of the villains is superb in <em>Begins</em> (Cillian Murphy&#8217;s Scarecrow is killer), they really take a backseat to Bruce&#8217;s story. I believe that it is in <em>Batman Begins</em> that Bruce becomes more comfortable in the cowl than outside of it. His mansion, his cars, his fancy suits are the real disguise. This is Batman&#8217;s inception (See what I did there?).</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Dark Knight" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.wildsound-filmmaking-feedback-events.com/images/the_dark_knight_dvd.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="263" />If the villains took a backseat in Nolan&#8217;s first bat-flick, then they take the driver&#8217;s seat (and probably stole it) in <em><strong>The Dark Knight</strong></em> (2008). It&#8217;s safe to say that crazy attracts crazy, and Bruce begins to see some of the ramifications for his particular brand of street justice when the Joker decides to use Gotham as his personal psych project. I will not spend time praising Heath Ledger&#8217;s Joker performance (Okay, maybe a little: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wQXSd1Jbqc" target="_blank">It&#8217;s phenomenal</a>!), it&#8217;s been praised to death. What I will praise is the Nolan brothers&#8217; screenplay, which focuses more on the big picture this time around. Batman/Bruce is forced to confront himself in the face of a villain whose motivations are far less black-and-white than his own. And even as he turns to Harvey Dent to be the &#8220;white knight&#8221; he cannot, his hopes are crushed by tragedy, Dent becoming another victim of the system, anarchy&#8217;s cold indifference and the Batman himself. It may not be the perfect Batman film (<em>Begins</em> is actually a lot closer to my ideal Batman, despite being a lesser overall film), but it&#8217;s a near perfect crime saga.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Riddle me this: Who is your favorite Batman? For me it’s a toss up between the super cheesy Bat-dork of TV and the uber gritty reeeeally-needs-a-therapist types.  For Batman Week my husband and in-house Batman expert, Matthew Dyer, helped me out with. . . dun, dun, dun. . . A Taxonomy of Batmen.</p>
<p>Use the following as your handy dandy Dark Knight guide and help us flesh out or create new categories.  It’s a wild wiki world after all.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Typically has a sidekick to explain things to (Robin, or <em>The Brave and the Bold</em> guest star)</li>
<li>Full of bizarrely specific gadgets (usually named Bat-somethings)</li>
<li>Can deduce the strangest of mysteries from only a few small clues</li>
<li>The only Bat that smiles</li>
<li>Can be heinously cheesy&mdash;fun when it works (West) and awful when it doesn’t (Clooney)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hard-Boiled Bat</strong>&mdash;Early 1940s comic Batman</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the myth, there was simply the Batman</li>
<li>Fought gangsters and criminals, carries a gun (and wasn’t afraid to use it)</li>
<li>Psychological state is less nuanced</li>
<li>Take away the weird outfit and he’s basically a tough 40s vigilante cop/detective</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deus Ex Batmachina</strong>&mdash;Star of DC Universe Animated movies; plutocrat and owner of the Justice League of America space station.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always ready to swoop in with a literal <em>deus ex machina</em>: some bat-device that keeps the story moving</li>
<li>Faceless and cold</li>
<li>Never appears as Bruce Wayne&mdash;mask and man meld</li>
<li>Is really just there to explain billions of dollars of sciencey stuff</li>
<li>Often a paranoid loner, but always a key member of the group</li>
<li>Has sci-fi gadgets and power armor to keep up with cosmic heroes like Superman and Green Lantern</li>
<li>Were it <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> he’d be Brad Pitt&mdash;cool, calm, hierarchically in the top 3</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Cranky old man with an edge</li>
<li>More of his shadowy psychology is unpacked, detailed and expanded through these storylines</li>
<li>End of Batman’s life has him losing perspective on his own beginnings and his reasons for being Batman in the first place</li>
<li>Luckily, he usually has a protege around to remind him of his purpose and power</li>
<li>Like a worn out wrestler, he’s still a hulking force but slower, craggy, broken and world-weary</li>
</ul>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3520" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/04/encyclopedia-batannica/batman3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman3.png" data-orig-size="486,293" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="batman3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman3.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman3.png?w=486" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman3.png?w=300&#038;h=180" alt="training" title="batman3" width="300" height="180" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3520" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman3.png?w=300&amp;h=180 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman3.png?w=150&amp;h=90 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman3.png 486w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <strong>Bat in Training</strong>&mdash;<em>Batman: Year One</em>; <em>The Batman</em> animated show; Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Dark Knight</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Batman before he has all his moves down</li>
<li>Struggling to deal with his role as a vigilante</li>
<li>Hungry, he aims to educate himself on how to be a fighter, a hero, a person</li>
<li>You might see a Rocky-esque training montage and learn about the ridiculously long line of lionhearted justice seekers in the Wayne family tree (relatives who created a stop on the Underground Railroad?! Nolan, I’m looking at you)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balanced Batman, the Dark Knight</strong>&mdash;<em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>; Tim Burton’s <em>Batman</em>; the best parts of the comics authored by countless writer/artist combos</p>
<ul>
<li>The modern archetype of the Dark Knight. An amalgamation of all of the above</li>
<li>Detective with psychological issues of his own</li>
<li>Realistic(ish) gadgets</li>
<li>A man with a complicated life, not completely hopeless, not cracking punny in clownish lycra</li>
<li>Good old regular Batstuff&mdash;the Batmobile; the Batcave with its trophies of past adventures; Alfred, Robin, and Jim Gordon</li>
</ul>
<p>So Bat-readers, what did we miss? Is there an archetypical Batman story that you know and love that doesn’t fall into one of the above categories? Don’t agree with the archetypes we’ve laid out? Where do all the ladies of Gotham and beyond fit into the Bat Saga? Let’s argue about it in the comments, in true comic book nerd fashion.</p>
