Someone that is different from the rest of the landscape, thrown into the spotlight, who dominates and then fades. Sometimes they aren’t a disappearing act. Sometimes there is something in the music that allows for a staying power, or at least the ability to listen and relisten to. I suppose I don’t know how I feel about Lady Gaga. I have heard a few of her songs and they are all pretty catchy, the electro pop elements with a voice that is stronger than it is weak, which is saying something within the medium of the music. </p>
<p>I know a few people who are big Gaga fans and what surprises me is that they are totally dissimilar people. Something about that disparity made me a bit more interested in Gaga. I send to work in the sense that there are interesting sounds in the world regardless of cache, when I heard them talking about Gaga I couldn’t help but want to give her a try. </p>
<p>Maybe I don’t mind a few of her songs as I have been rather isolated from the ‘outrageous’ fashion statements and other things gaga has put out into the world.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrO4YZeyl0I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>What turned me onto this path is the song &#8220;Bad Romance.&#8221; See I heard it, saw the video a few times then found it on YouTube. I don’t want to say that I got hooked but I really thought it was a catchy, catchy track. There is a combination in the song; it feels like two parts of a greater song, what with the slightly Romanian sounding verses and the soaring choruses. </p>
<p>But the song for me is tied to the video in a way that renders the song lame when I’m not watching the video. I like the song but to hear the song while watching the video really cements the song as an earworm that you can’t shake. But I have not been able to do anything while listening to the song. Can’t run to it, can’t drive the car to it. </p>

I don’t know if I agree with that. It seems of late that she moved away from the Klaus Nomi/Debbie Harry LP covers phase of her fashion and into a phase where she is showing (and shaking) her ass. &#8220;Bad Romance&#8221; feels like a performance piece more than a video. &#8220;Telephone&#8221; feels like a film more than a video. Maybe that is the core of who she is, a New York City musical performance artist. A tiny version of Jayne County or a jigglier version of Laurie Anderson with a growing dose of Madonna’s approach to sexuality.  I don’t really mean to compare her to these artists, but when I try to think about her in a greater context I feel that she is a performance artist, one who uses the medium of the moment to further her career and keep herself in the public eye. </p>
<p>&#8220;Telephone&#8221; is another instance where Beyonce is completely upstaged by Gaga. Beyonce is easily overshadowed and while her attempts to step into Gaga&#8217;s world are brave they do expose her as a bit of a stale pony compared with something that feels new and daring.  That said I think &#8220;Telephone&#8221; is a HELLUVA cut</p>
<p>Will her music stand the test of time? Will she fade away? Will the second full-length album capitalize on momentum or will it cease, like so much does, in the interim of when you are recording.</p>

As someone who enjoys kitsch, camp, pop culture and excess, Gaga’s arrival on the world stage was exciting, titillating and dangerous.  Why dangerous?  Well, I liked her immediately, but I pretended to myself that this wasn’t the case.  She’s too pop.  Too silly.  Too out there.  Too much.  What would people think of me if I l bought her album?  Wouldn’t they judge me for falling for her supposed emptiness, buying into her spectacle?  Don’t I know better as an informed consumer?</p>
<p>Enjoying Gaga and her music gets me the same reaction as when I share my love of professional wrestling (WWF 80s style specifically).  The response is either a perplexed, “really?!” laced in a chortle of disgust, or a joyful squee of shared tastes.  Even though many partake in a similar level of excitement for Gaga, I can’t shake the sense that there’s something wrong about my love, something transgressive.  And for some reason it really hurts my feelings when people hate on my Lady.</p>
<p>Now, I am of sound mind (in this instance) and I understand that people are multifaceted complex beings capable of liking different music and still getting along.  I have enough Sesame Street literacy to comprehend this fact.  Yet, when people drag Gaga down, hate her for being a copy of a copy of a copy, or they scoff at her irony as though they’re examining the “fabric” of the emperor’s new clothes, I feel judged.  She refers to her hoards of fans as her “little monsters,” but I don’t think this sobriquet is meant to label us as abject <em>for liking her</em>. </p>
<p>The origin of the name goes along with the subject matter of many of her songs.  She interprets certain encounters with gender, sex and relationships as monstrous and shocks us all with her performance of ugliness.  In G’s world, everyone is capable of monstrosity whether it be through devouring someone’s heart (“he ate my heart…he’s a monster in my bed”) or losing oneself in the toothy maw of Hollywood fame.  Gaga’s strange demeanor, abhorrently over-the-top clothing and wacky persona won over (or ate) the hearts of many who stand out as odd and constantly struggle to fit in.  She deemed her fans her monsters as a way of accepting the outcast position and shifting the spotlight of pop onto the shadowy figures of culture.  Usually, strange kids stick within their underground groups and construct counter cultural phenomena, but this concept of a popular movement of outcastedness presents a different approach that piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Clearly, such a concept can be problematic.  Isn’t pop generated by co-opting the originality of often under-represented groups who’ve been discriminated against?  Yes.  Doesn’t the idea of the “weirdo” get processed, packaged and sold back to the desirous consumer when they already owned their weirdness for free?  Uh-huh.  And isn’t her brand of ugliness a little hard to swallow seeing as she’s thin, muscular, blond, rich and if not classically beautiful then strikingly gorgeous?  Yeppers.  </p>
<p>And I saw all this first hand.</p>
<p>I tucked my shame aside, put on my giddy glee and went to see Gagita in Auburn Hills.  I fashioned a giant glitter spider headband, rocked some hot booties and doused my face in bold shades of metallic makeup.  The show was a neon broken down mess of stimulating awesomeness.  Her vocals clear, powerful, unaided by autotune, were actually better in person.  Her energy was unfathomable and her performance was dazzling.</p>
<p>Still, I couldn’t help but be bothered by those nagging questions I mentioned before.  At one point in the show she said something along the lines of it didn’t matter who we were, where we came from, who we loved or how much money we had, we were capable of anything and we were all together in monstrosity that night.  Well, seeing as my friend Andrea and I were angry enough to tear someone’s wig off because we thought our seats were too far away from the stage (seats that cost $100!), I felt pretty awkward about the idea of classless equality.  If we were in the cheap seats then the less fortunate monsters were definitely not in the building.  On top of this, I saw more than a few gaggles of unnaturally mature little girls teetering about on their expensive stacked heels.  These girls appeared affluent (judging by mom’s status bag) and looked like they walked off the set of “Mean Girls.”  In the arena, Gaga was cheered for propelling a big F.U. to just this type of girl from her high school past.  In my mind I doubted that the shared experience of being a little monster would be enough to end the nastiness between the mean girls and the weird ones.  If anything, l could imagine the pretty girls’ fancier experience of the Gaga show just once again proved that they were better than everyone else. Now, I don’t know that those girls were actually mean or rich or that they didn’t genuinely feel ugly on the inside, but they just left me wondering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I also saw some amazingly positive shows within the show.  A legion of LGBT fans were out in full force, more than a few crying and adoring every moment of the night.  I saw mothers and daughters dressed in matching home-made costumes dancing together on a Saturday.  I sat in front of an entire family replete with young boys totally enjoying the experience together.  And I had a really great time.  It was fun, like pop is supposed to be and the atmosphere was friendly, lively and communal.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though I know there are some irksome issues surrounding Lady Gaga and the big business that engulfs her, I still love her.  Her boldness is both capable of lighting up lives and turning a lot of people off, but that’s what happens when you put yourself out there.  </p>
<p>I think I get personally upset when folks bemoan her because beyond all the PR BS, I actually do feel like a stranger and I loathe not being able to please everyone.  Things would be much easier if I could just pretend to be what everybody wanted, but I’ve done that before and it made me feel like I didn’t exist.  At age 29, 5 years older that Gaga, if I can see her as a role model who helps me to be bold, be loud and upset someone every day, then I guess I’m saying I’m willing to take her&mdash;ugly truths and all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many witness to the Lady Gaga phenomenon, I saw the burgeoning celebrity popping up here and there in her eye-catching, show-stopping ensembles, and I had no idea what her music sounded like. I pictured a possibly screeching and borderline unlistenable (in the best possible way, of course) new incantation of opera-slayer Diamanda Galas: a modern, mini-Galas, using her voice and some complex backup noise to alienate and enrapture listeners all at once.</p>
<p>I was in for a surprise.</p>

Williams, Lydia Lunch, KatieJane Garside, Amanda Palmer. Center, Lady Gaga </p></div> Lady Gaga may not be the first to apply an avant-garde, performance-art sensibility to pop music (i.e. Grace Jones), but she is the first to do it with music and theatrics that seem, at the outset, so shockingly dissimilar. Evidence of her amazing success proves it a shrewd move&mdash;like John Waters said genially of his barely-predecessor, Andy Warhol, “[He] <em>finally</em> had the idea to put homosexuality and drugs <em>together</em> for the first time.” Often the public doesn’t know what it hungers for until it’s smack-dab in the middle of eating it up. </p>
<p>This marriage of mainstream music and high-art pageantry is the very thing that confused me about Gaga the moment I finally tuned in to one of her music videos. Aging hipster that I am, and coming from a post-90s, post-Riot Grrl setting, I was used to music and style that were as consistent with each other as the pot and the kettle. Bikini Kill sounded like they looked. L7 sounded like they looked. Courtney Love&mdash;as the front woman for Hole&amp;mdah;sounded like she looked (at least then). And PJ Harvey evolved fluidly between looks, all of them so very ‘her’. But Gaga sounded like Top 40 and dressed wackier than Nina Hagen. This. . . did not follow.</p>

At that time you rarely saw people with facial jewelry who weren&#8217;t pretty committed to one of any number of left-of-center lifestyles attributed to those who moved into and out of the piercing world. &#8220;But the Spice Girls are British,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;Maybe piercings are more common over there?&#8221; By the time Christina Aguilera got a labret, it was all over (nothing against Aguilera, of course).</p>
<p>With the added advent of the Hot Topic mall stores where you could suddenly purchase garb previously only available in big-city sex shops, the music industry began to notice that people liked the punk, post-punk, alternative and bad-girl styles without having to be saddled with the pesky experimental music that went with it. A girl who’s crazy-bad and hawt’, but sings something I can dance to, dude. Jeez.</p>
<p>Some sort of musical entity or truth I found in the consistency&mdash;or predictability&mdash;of style-matching-music was suddenly becoming outdated. And gone, too, was the entitlement or ownership that went with it. The idea that through experimenting with or abandoning feminine artifice, being shunned for wearing too little makeup or called names for wearing too much, being honest and raw and most of all, making insane music, female musicians somehow earned the right to look this way: the red badge of misfit courage. And that’s not meant to be snobbish or elitist, it’s just. . . if all the regular girls dress like the outcasts, what’s left for the outcasts?</p>
<p>I tried to consider the angle that a decline in stereotyping of any kind was technically and obviously a good thing, even if it was stereotype I sort-of liked. But I was seeing the dichotomy that spawned so many of the female musicians I admired becoming obsolete too. Wendy O. Williams&mdash;who was so sexy, so angry and so dangerous she could go onstage topless and destroy a car and men were frightened instead of titillated. Or Lydia Lunch, whose fierce sensuality challenged mores and sexual classism whether she was singing her own volatile work or acting in the renegade films she co-wrote with Richard Kern. Or Amanda Palmer, a contemporary of Gaga and a musician I’m such a huge fan of it’s a joke, who refused to Photoshop her belly in<a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i62UF7uROGU"> the music video &#8220;Leeds United&#8221;</a> when her record label told her she was too fat, saying they wouldn’t back her album with any more promotion or financing if she didn’t either cut or alter the shots in the video of her stomach, to make it look thinner. </p>

America loves women who lay themselves bare as damaged goods and unapologetically invite others round to watch them burn. KatieJane Garside did it, as the front-woman of the band Daisy Chainsaw in the 90s, Queen Adreena in the early 2000s and Ruby Throat today. I’m a longtime Garside fan, and have watched her act out the libertine unraveling of many different identities throughout her career, with great vulnerability and distress. But also with outrage, weaving weakened pleas  with unhinged screaming. Lady Gaga’s music is not without antagonism, plotting and caginess, but she doesn’t use raw anger in the way that so many <em>Angry Women</em> preceding her did (inspiring <a target="new" href="http://www.researchpubs.com/books/angrprod.php by Re/Search Publications">the 90s book of the same name</a>). And that is a clever business move, because raw anger is too off-putting for most consumers and limits your audience, no matter what. Whereas crazy-acting women can seem hot-to-trot as long as the craziness manifests itself in passivity and self-destruction, and not in aggression or acting out in a way that&#8217;s threatening.</p>
<p>I try to explain these things, and worry I begin to sound like a crotchety Pete Seeger, horrified by Bob Dylan’s infamous electric set at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. And as Seeger and others ranted that Dylan was a traitor to ‘pure’ folk music, Peter Yarrow (of Peter, Paul &amp; Mary) allegedly yelled, “This is what the young people want! We have to go with the change!”</p>

Nothing could’ve endeared me to Lady Gaga more than the Glee episode devoted to her music, or the reactions of her young fans, for whom she is ground-breaking, iconic and freeing. They have never seen anything like her before, and she inspires them to imagine bigger versions of themselves. And I&#8217;m reminded of myself sitting in my bedroom, listening, motionless, to The Cramps&#8217; <em>Songs the Lord Taught Us</em> while staring at the cd insert, unable to believe the riveting new sounds I was hearing and overjoyed that I had discovered music so unusual and alive. And I&#8217;m sure generations before me could have rolled their eyes and said, &#8220;Oh honey, Link Wray and The Trashmen did that first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Gaga works hard, and I respect her drive. The main thing she makes me feel, is old. And I&#8217;m totally ok with that. Music is how young people work away at carving out both their similarities and their differences to their parents, their peers and to the world around them. If everyone liked the same thing, talking to others about the arts would be insufferable. And if the values of one music genre or music itself stayed static from to one decade to the next, it would stagnate. I want young people to be creative and headstrong and try new things and firmly believe&mdash;just as I did&mdash;that they are the first people in the whole world to feel all the things that have inspired songwriting for over a hundred years. I want them to feel they can claim an artistic realm that that should always, and hopefully will always, inspire great passion, movement and ideas, not feel apathetic about it because it&#8217;s been marked and hoarded by the generation before them. Everyone deserves a turn to feel as though the music they love can change the world, because it all does; at least a little. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I learned that <em>The Idler</em> was going to devote a week to The Lady herself (Gaga, that is), I thought The F Word might have to opt out, due to obvious subject matter constraints. As I thought more about it, though, I started thinking about the reasons I named this column what I did. </p>
<p>While I think Americans like talking about food almost as much as they like eating it, I think that food can also become a bad word, especially for women. Indulgence is a sin, one always committed with excuses (A bad day at work. A bad boyfriend. I’ve been doing a juice cleanse for a month). Food can be a bad thing. Do you notice how you don’t want to be one who orders dessert first? “I’ll get one if you get one.” “We’ll be fatasses together.” It’s shameful to be the one who wants it. Unless, of course, you have someone else to balance your want for the dessert with feelings of regret afterward. I’d say it’s almost in fashion to think that you are fat. Or to say that you <em>think</em> you’re fat. No one wants to hear a woman say that she thinks she looks beautiful and thin today. Any compliments should be countered with something negative.</p>
<p>Woman 1: “Ugh, I ate so much at dinner today. I must have gained twelve pounds.”<br />
Woman 2: “Shut up. You’re so skinny.”<br />
Woman 1: “Well, my stomach is pretty flat, but I’ve pretty much resigned myself to big thighs.”<br />
Woman 2: “No way. I am so much fatter than you.”<br />
Woman 1: “Are you kidding? You have <em>hips</em>. I look like an eleven-year-old boy. And you have the best smile. My teeth are so hideous.”<br />
[Note: This is an actual conversation I’ve had. More than once. I’m no less guilty.]</p>
<p>On an on, a contest of who can out-ugly whom. Instead of focusing on what we like about ourselves, we’re looking for the flaws.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve noticed an upsetting trend where I don’t feel like I can say anything when I feel happy about the progress I have made. I’ve never been very overweight, but I definitely gained the freshman 15, and have worked about four years to get to a point where I have incorporated exercise and (mostly) healthy eating into a part of my daily routine. I make sure I balance cardio with weight training and with relaxation, like yoga. I went clothes shopping a month ago and fit into a size two pants for the first time. The only person I felt comfortable sharing my excitement with were my mom and my friend Anna, who has made a similar effort to be healthy and now can run half marathons in her sleep. And still beat everyone.</p>
<p>As I was typing that paragraph, I can feel a sense of ire from invisible readers. I felt afraid typing it. Even worse, I have a problem now where many of my pants don’t fit, so I worry about looking unprofessional at work, but don’t have the money to replace all of my pants. I realize this is very much a first-world problem. And, it’s barely even a “problem.” But I know that I can’t voice thoughts like this without someone saying “SHUT UP. YOU ARE SO SKINNY. YOU GO TO THE GYM ALL THE TIME. I HAD TO BUY A SIZE BIGGER PANTS YESTERDAY.” It’s not like I haven’t been there too. It’s not like I feel great about myself at all times. However, I’m really tired of the culture of self-hate. I’m tired of having to lie and say I’m so fat when I know I’m not. What’s wrong with our conceptions of food and our bodies if we don’t feel comfortable telling the truth about them?</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1539" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/11/01/i-want-your-ugly/lady-gaga-out-magazine/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/lady-gaga-out-magazine.jpg" data-orig-size="400,331" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Lady-Gaga-out-magazine" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/lady-gaga-out-magazine.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/lady-gaga-out-magazine.jpg?w=400" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/lady-gaga-out-magazine.jpg?w=300&#038;h=248" alt="Lady Gaga" title="Lady-Gaga-out-magazine" width="300" height="248" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1539" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/lady-gaga-out-magazine.jpg?w=300&amp;h=248 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/lady-gaga-out-magazine.jpg?w=150&amp;h=124 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/lady-gaga-out-magazine.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> That’s why I admire Lady Gaga. I’d agree that her body is far from the average woman’s body, but she’s not afraid to be as much of a freak as she wants. She feels free to appear in public in ridiculous hats or showing enough skin to incur some really unfortunate sunburns. She doesn’t give a shit about what you think. It’s not a shock that I saw lots of Gagas out for Halloween—what an opportunity for women to be as much of a freak as they want, and go to out without covering up, pulling down, checking and rechecking the mirror for telltale fat rolls. </p>
<p>On Halloween, I went to see <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> at midnight, where people were dressed as half boys, half girls, in lingerie, as Aeon Flux, men dressed as women, women dressed as men, women dressed as men dressed like women, and lots of skin all around. While it was definitely not something you’d want grandma to see, it was so refreshing to see a large crowd of people enjoying being themselves, comfortable in their bodies. </p>
<p>Obviously, there are health concerns to being overweight that should not be ignored. But, for the love of Gaga, can we please try to look for things that we like about our bodies, rather than picking on everything that we hate? As Gaga would say, “I want your love.” Or, alternatively, “Rah rah ah ah ah, ro ma, ro ma ma, ga ga ooh la la.”</p>
