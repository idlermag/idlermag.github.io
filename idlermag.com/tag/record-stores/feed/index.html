					<description><![CDATA[When I travel or go anywhere new, really, I always make it my main goal to find a record store. Remember those? I’m sure that anyone living in New York or Los Angeles knows what I’m talking about. Other places perhaps not so much, as they are fading away, replaced by a computer application or a megastore with the cheapest prices and cheapest selection. I was lucky then to find Requests Music in Wailuku, Hawaii, which is, they claim, the only “record store” on the island of Maui.

It was a Monday and the family and I drove back across the island to get some food and a few other things. But first on my mind was getting to Requests. We came up on it; I parked the car and strolled up to discover it was CLOSED for President’s Day! I actually hit them up on Twitter (<a target="new" href="http://www.twitter.com/@RequestsHI">@RequestsHI</a>) and returned the next day. I’m glad I did.

Remember those? I’m sure that anyone living in New York or Los Angeles knows what I’m talking about. Other places perhaps not so much, as they are fading away, replaced by a computer application or a megastore with the cheapest prices and cheapest selection. I was lucky then to find Requests Music in Wailuku, Hawaii, which is, they claim, the only “record store” on the island of Maui.</p>
<p>It was a Monday and the family and I drove back across the island to get some food and a few other things. But first on my mind was getting to Requests. We came up on it; I parked the car and strolled up to discover it was CLOSED for President’s Day! I actually hit them up on Twitter (<a target="new" href="http://www.twitter.com/@RequestsHI">@RequestsHI</a>) and returned the next day. I’m glad I did.</p>
<p>There were CDs lining the walls, boxes on top of boxes of used discs. In the center of the store there were racks of CDs, tons of Hip Hop, tons of Reggae and tons of Hawaiian music. There were LPs everywhere and the place just smelled like vinyl, that warm, musty smell of age that you get when you crack open a box in the garage. Two big speakers were playing some cosmic jazz and then some heavy old R&amp;B. The stairs to the basement offered a chance to sift through the unfiled stacks of LPs underground. I stayed away from the basement, as you can’t be carrying a suitcase full of LPs while traveling.</p>
<p>The store has been in the same location for twenty years, no small feat for any retail location, let alone a record store in the year 2010. I hope it stays there another 20. Once you strolled in the big double doors you’re surrounded by music of all sorts, you feel at ease and at home and ready for everything you could possibly find. My wife can always tell when I leave a good record store because my response is consistent. “The store looks good.” Doesn’t really sound like much but I don’t say it often. I say that because I have been in too many stores that don’t look good. You know instantly when a store is empty and unloved.  My beloved JAM music, the last time I shopped it before it closed, didn’t look good. There was stuff there I bought but on the whole you just know when a store is good and when a store is ill.</p>
<p>What makes a store is the appearance and the selection, the feeling of getting lost, and the conversations. I talked and talked with the guy behind the counter, he was helpful and friendly and just very easy to deal with. This is where iTunes fails. I can read 1700 album reviews and see how many people LOVED the music, but how helpful is that? By talking with an actual person you get their energy, their thoughts and you can tell by their body language that something has touched him in a deep and profound way. Working behind the counter, you build a relationship with your customers. You come to respect their preferences and if you are lucky they are influenced by your tastes and recommendations. I spent hours talking up rap music and the debate surrounding it with a few cats in 1995. They’d come in, two black dudes, and we would shoot the shit about it. The store was empty, sadly, and we could do that. When the first Best Buy opened in Okemos in late 1995 I wandered in and saw one of the two guys working there. He saw me, ran up and gave me a big hug and welcomed me to his musical playground. I didn’t even know his name, I don’t think he knew mine, but in our conversations we found common ground. I never saw him again but I felt like I had done something right in that moment. At the bookstore where I worked I only had five consistent customers but I still remember their names and I miss the interactions I had with them when they would shop my section.</p>
<p>What made Requests so great to me was more than just the selection or the smell; it was the sum of the whole. The combination of everything that being a record store is and was for so long. It was instantly comfortable, instantly fun, and instantly addictive. I don’t believe in Heaven, but goddamn it was close.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There is such a thing as a flow of discovery. I once read a review of Ry Cooder's <em>Chicken Skin Music</em>, a review that plucked the record out of the henhouse of obscurity and dusted it off for me to rediscover.  As with all Cooder discs he had interesting guests, this time including the Tex-Mex musician Flaco Jiminez and the Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar legend Gabby Pahinui. I enjoyed the LP very much, and it spurred me into one of my slightly predictable retail plunges. I bought <em>Chicken Skin Music</em>. Then I bought his first and second releases, <em>Ry Cooder</em> and <em>Into the Valley</em>. Then I bought <em>Paradise &#38; Lunch</em>, which is an all-time great in desperate need of a reissue. When I stopped sucking up the Cooder I re-listened to <em>Chicken Skin Music</em>. This time Gabby Pahinui really caught my ear, so I did some research and discovered that Cooder played on Pahinui’s LP <em>The Gabby Pahinui Hawaiian Band Volume 1</em>. I bought it and fell in love with it. This opened the floodgates and I began absorbing Hawaiian music like it was air. I also pumped up the Hawaiian music section in the store where I worked. I must have had the largest Hawiian section west of Maui.

I once read a review of Ry Cooder&#8217;s <em>Chicken Skin Music</em>, a review that plucked the record out of the henhouse of obscurity and dusted it off for me to rediscover.  As with all Cooder discs he had interesting guests, this time including the Tex-Mex musician Flaco Jiminez and the Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar legend Gabby Pahinui.

I must have had the largest Hawiian section west of Maui.</p>
<p>The flow that my river of discovery took was totally natural, it worked around every obstacle, and most importantly, it was totally up to me to find new things and trust that what I heard once would continue to appeal to me with greater exposure. I have always likened my desire for new music to the life of a shark: If I stop moving it dies, so I always move, and I always want more and more and more. Maybe I just have an addictive personality, but what really appeals to me is the intensely personal process of discovery that comes from digging just under the surface of an LP.</p>
<p>Is it possible, in the age of the Internet, to continue to discover these facts, these sounds on our own? On my shelf at home, I have a two-volume set of facts and information on global music. Two books. With the Internet I can type in an artist’s name and get pages and pages of information. Is this the same thing? Is the end result any different given the sources we use in our hunt for discovery? I think that it is, but it could be just me. </p>

Imagine the revelation that must have come from hearing the new sounds in the air in Los Angeles in the 50s and early 60s. Imagine how that would have combined with his talent to create a hunger for more and more new sounds. How could he not explore? And how could a listener not want to explore as well? Through Cooder’s music one gets the feeling of following a musical Johnny Appleseed, who gives us new sounds to pick up and plant in our ears in the hope that something new will grow. By sharing Cooder’s process of curiosity and discovery we are changed forever. The process involves work but the reward feels greater for it.</p>
<p>This is where the death of the modern record store enters the picture. You can sit at a computer and type and watch the screen flick and flitter. But does it resonate? Do new sounds stick with you in today’s blink-and-you-miss-it-culture? Or is there something about someone working behind a counter that encourages discovery by allowing you to experience someone else’s enthusiasm? Is there something about that exchange that makes discovery more palpable, more personal, more real?</p>
<p>Maybe that is what Cooder was doing all those years ago&mdash;sharing his discoveries so that we could make them our own. Maybe he’s still doing it now. But who’s still listening and who’s still seeking? How do we find these people if there’s no place to go?</p>
