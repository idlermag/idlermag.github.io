										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe the first time I tasted prosecco was on the Paris to Milan Artesia night train. It’s called the Stendhal service and that’s a perfect name for a journey between these two cities. Stendhal was the pen name of Marie-Henri Beyle, a French writer well known for his unrequited love for  Mathilde, Countess Dembowska, whom he met while living in Milan.</p>
<p>Stendhal’s book, <em>On Love</em> is the reaction to this experience. It’s an attempt to dissect romantic love in a logical, level-headed way. As a Frenchman suffering from failed Italian-style desire, he made a worthy attempt. </p>
<blockquote><p>To make this course of action clear to my French readers, I must explain that in Italy, a country very far away from us, people are still driven to despair by love.</p></blockquote>
<p>We left Paris Bercy station in the early evening, scheduled to arrive in Milano Centrale station the next morning. I was feeling in a champagne state, but the dining car waiter suggested in French we should try an Italian sparkling wine instead, to put our hearts and minds in the mood of our destination.</p>
<p>Prosecco is dry, lemony, and bubbly. It’s created from predominately Prosecco grapes in the northern Veneto region of Italy in the foothills of the Alps on the opposite side of Italy from where we were going. We missed most of the scenery through the Alps since we traveled at night, but it was April. It was quite chilly and we saw snow on the ground whenever we slowed down.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Milan it was pouring rain. Our hotel, the most luxurious I’ve ever stayed in, was only a few blocks away.  After unsuccessfully trying to flag a taxi for more than a half-hour, we started to walk, umbrellas in one hand, one black, tourist-style, small, wheelie suitcase each in the other.</p>
<p>We arrived, dripping wet like two drowned rats, at the grand entrance of Hotel Principe di Savoia at 6:30 am. The bellman were not quite sure whether to laugh or cry at the sight of us. Rain puddles sloshed beneath us at the reception desk. I’m not sure if it was my hotel Platinum status or our pathetic state that forced the fastest check-in I’ve ever experienced, especially for an Italian hotel so early on a Saturday morning. </p>
<p>They showed us to a wondrous room. My traveling companion called it the Gianni Versace suite because of the gilt, multiple mirrors, and heavy velvet brocade of the bedding and draperies. </p>
<p>After a hot shower, a nap, and a late room service breakfast, we ventured out. The sun was shining.  Our first stop was the “quadrilatero della moda&#8221; where the luxury brands of Italian fashion live: via Manzoni, via Montenapoleone, via della Spiga and via Sant&#8217;Andrea. A lovely lunch included more prosecco.</p>
<p>When I came back to the U.S. the brand of prosecco I saw most often in the liquor stores was <a href="http://www.mionettousa.com/prosecco-il.php" target="_blank">Mionetto “IL” Prosecco D.o.c. di Treviso</a>. It’s a black bottle with a distinctive golden swirl. I drink Prosecco almost every time I eat Italian, at least as an aperitif. Some of the better restaurants surprisingly don’t serve it, since it’s not well known.  </p>
<p>It should be.</p>
<p>Although there are other very fine versions available, this Mionetto is not expensive, typically about $12.99 here in Chicago. If you’re a wine snob you might think that’s because the bottle is sealed with a generic 21-teeth crown cork bottle cap rather than a traditional foil covered cork inside the wire housing called the &#8220;cage&#8221;. The champagne ceremony of flipping up the wire ring of the cage, turning it exactly six half-turns counter-clockwise, freeing the cage from the neck of the bottle and then loudly popping a cork is lost. </p>
<p>But what you gain in fun bubbles is worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, I went out to a sort-of-upscale Irish sports bar in the Lower Haight to watch the Michigan State football game with some other alumni. Besides the fact that there would be other green-and-white-clad people there, the bar’s attraction was their bottomless mimosas. For $8, you could have as many of those little darlings as you wanted. Because the game started at 12:30 Pacific time, I figured it was much more appropriate to get tipsy from some champagne and orange juice than from a couple of long islands. I planned to be the classiest drunk Michigan State fan in San Francisco.</p>
<p>When we got to the bar and found the tables of green and white, I caught a glimpse of the mimosas. What I liked was the large pitcher on the table. What alarmed me were the tiny champagne glasses. Girls in lots of makeup with perfectly tousled hair wearing football jerseys sipped from the delicate-stemmed glasses like they were at a fucking Sunday afternoon tea party with their grandmothers. Despite how much I love champagne, I decided this would not do. It would not do at all.</p>
<p>Instead, I ordered a Blue Moon. For the longest time, I thought beer was disgusting and that it smelled like vomit. I couldn’t understand why anyone drank it. I only drank it when I played drinking games in college and even then, I drank it like a shot &#8212; to get it over with as quickly as possible. I’ve since learned to tolerate some beers, but it’s not really the beer that I like &#8212; it’s the message it sends. In this case, I was trying to meet new people, thus I wanted to look approachable and not as weird as I actually am. Drinking a Blue Moon while watching the Spartans says <em>hey, I’m not just drinking beer to get crunk. I like a </em>good<em> beer. Otherwise I’d be having a PBR. I’m not uptight, but I’m not pretentious either. You can talk to me about this game and I’ll probably know what you’re talking about. Let’s be friends.</em></p>
<p>The girl sitting across from me came back from the bar with a tall glass of something clearish and bubbly with a lime, and I asked her what she was drinking. “Ginger ale,” she said, and I thought WHAT A SQUARE. Even as someone who originally wanted to be a nondrinker, I used her drink to make a complete judgment on her personality. (Even though she went to school at Michigan State, she thought Canada Dry ginger ale was better than Vernors ginger ale, when Vernors is the OBVIOUSLY SUPERIOR CHOICE, so it may partly have been that that skewed my judgment).</p>
<p>When I ask someone “What are you drinking?” I’m not asking because I really care. (Do you ever ask someone what they had for dinner and really want to know the answer? Unless you have children, I’m guessing the answer is no.) I’m asking because I’m going to go ahead and base your personality on your answer. Here are some common drinks and what I think about you when you drink them at a bar (or what I think about myself when I drink them):</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong>: You’re the designated driver. Or you’re trying to sober up. You’re responsible, probably more so than I am. Will you bring me a water later, when I’m too drunk to realize I need one?</p>
<p><strong>Rum and coke</strong>: You just turned 21 and don’t know what else to order.</p>
<p><strong>Long island</strong>: You are outgoing and entertaining. You’d probably be that way even if you weren’t drinking four different types of alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Gin and tonic</strong>: You’re a classy motherfucker, because I don’t think these taste very good. Since you like something that isn’t very tasty, then you’re a unique little snowflake.</p>
<p><strong>PBR</strong>: The obvious judgment is that you’re a hipster, but really it’s probably that you are a college student or an unsuccessful young professional, or very nearly unemployed, or a writer, and this was the cheapest thing on the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Whiskey straight</strong>: You probably read poetry for fun and buy music only on vinyl. You probably actually have a working record player. You might have father issues and are perpetually sad. I’m too intimidated and immature to speak to you.</p>
<p><strong>Tequila straight</strong>: You are an efficient drinker. I’d like you to manage my investment portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Wine</strong>: You are European. Or, if you&#8217;re American, you would rather be anywhere but here. You’re hoping this wine gives you a headache so you can feign distress and go home to your bed. Unless you’re at a wine bar, in which case, carry on. And order me a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Shots</strong>: It’s your birthday. Or you are a bachelorette.</p>
<p><strong>Pitcher of beer</strong>: You are in a fraternity, or you really like to use the word “bro.” You like to laugh and spill things. You have a loud voice but you don’t mind because it makes people look at you. I’ll mock you until I go home, secretly upset that your tab was so much smaller than mine.</p>
<p><strong>Soda</strong>: You are pregnant.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you have judged me for having that mimosa? What drinks would you add?</p>
<p><em>Note: Context is important. Drinking wine with dinner is much different than drinking wine at a bar, just like drinking a Bud Light at a tailgate is different than ordering it on tap. No offense was intended. If you were offended, I apologize, but you should probably go have a drink.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell for tequila long before I ever traveled to Mexico. From what I remember &#8212; although tequila memories are always a bit blurry &#8212; I’ve never actually fallen because of tequila. That honor goes to the Mexican dark beer, <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/75/667" target="_blank">Negra Modelo</a>. Cerveza oscura  &#8212; dark beer &#8212; was my drink of choice on the weekends in <a href="http://www.stuinmobiliaria.com/ixtapa-zihuatanejo-costa-grande-guerrero/" target="_blank">Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo</a> after I started living and working in Mexico.  </p>
<p>A story for another day. . .</p>
<p>When I was in high school and college my liquor was whiskey. It wasn’t until I graduated and started working that I tasted tequila. My best friend on my first job, as an internal auditor at the first “too big to fail bank” <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/04/18/mckenna-speaks-at-american-accounting-assn-public-interest-conference/" target="_blank">Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago</a>, was the oldest of five children of Mexican immigrants. Maria invited me to all the family’s gatherings. </p>
<p>Tequila was an important part of parties at their house, and the men &#8212; and Maria’s mother, sisters, and aunts – drank tequila shots to celebrate the new year, a birthday, a baptism, or just about any happy occasion and all the sad ones. Maria’s father, Rodolfo, taught me a rule of thumb for drinking tequila – one is never enough and three is too many.</p>
<p>When I started working in Mexico following that rule kept me safe.</p>
<p>I went to Mexico – and Argentina and Brazil – in 1997 as the project leader for J.P. Morgan’s Year 2000 (Y2K) project in Latin America. At that time, I was working for KPMG Consulting. Later I would go to work for J.P. Morgan directly in Latin America so I could stay on the project and in the region. I returned to the states at the end of 2001 after returning to BearingPoint, the successor firm of KPMG Consulting, once the Y2K project was completed.</p>
<p>During the early years of the project, 1997-1998, I worked primarily in Mexico. It was closer to New York, where the JP Morgan global team was based, and I preferred Mexico to Brazil or Argentina. Not that I didn’t like the other two countries. They have their charms, but Mexico was where I felt most comfortable.</p>
<p>I was the boss. As a woman, a foreign woman, you might think I had a hard time. Not at all. I could read and write Spanish fairly well when I arrived and worked hard to learn how to understand spoken Spanish and to speak as an educated professional during my time there. </p>
<p>My team, all men, were a big help in achieving that goal. The best way to learn a language, after loving with it, is to socialize using it.</p>
<p>The majority of the team came from the local KPMG offices and the rest from the local J.P. Morgan offices. There were a few women working with me in Argentina and Brazil, but in Mexico City it was all men. Management assigned primarily the younger professionals to help me with the tedious testing and documentation tasks needed to successfully complete the projects in each country before the start of the new millennium.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, KPMG is KPMG all over the world. We worked hard and played harder. The Mexican professionals treated me like a queen. We celebrated a project milestone or just the end of a long week together and I never had to eat alone if I didn’t want to. I never felt alone or unsafe in Mexico City. </p>
<p>One of the restaurants we liked to go was Mezzanotte, in Polanco on Avenida Presidente Masaryk. It was great because they had excellent Italian food and then, later in the evening, it turned into a nightclub. If you stayed through dinner you could keep your table and we danced the nights away in between them.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to taking tequila “la bandera,&#8221; Mexican flag style at Mezzanotte. The waiter serves three shot glasses. One has tequila blanco, another has lime juice for the green of the flag and the third contains sangrita, a spicy tomato juice chaser for red. I don’t know if it’s traditional but the guys always made me shout “Viva Mexico!” when we drank “la Bandera.”  </p>
<p>In short time I realized I really liked the taste of tequila. That can be a dangerous and expensive bow to the local culture, since I was never served less than a reposado, or aged 100% agave tequila. More often they ordered an añejo, the finest. I acquired a preference for <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a>, which is wasted if not taken straight. But a lady, and the boss, should not routinely drink her staff of young men under the table via tequila shots. It’s both tacky and a career-limiting move.  </p>
<p>Another restaurant, La Valentina in Polanco , was where the team introduced me to <a href="http://www.cocktailtimes.com/original/don_paloma.shtml" target="_blank">the Paloma</a>. Take a tall glass, some ice, a generous helping of tequila and Squirt. The carbonation in the lemon-lime flavored Mexican version of Squirt &#8212; much more pungent than Squirt available in the United States &#8212; serves as an inebriation antidote. You can have the flavor of tequila, and much more of it than doing straight shots, and remain upright for much longer. This approach, too, has its limits but I thankfully never reached them in any unpleasant way.</p>
<p>Another place the guys took me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Garibaldi" target="_blank">Plaza Garibaldi</a>, the <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2007/12/31/musings-on-the-eve-of-the-new-year/" target="_blank">center of mariachi</a> in Mexico City. The best cantina &#8212; and one a woman is allowed to enter &#8212; is <a href="http://www.planeteyetraveler.com/2010/06/24/cantina-crawl-salon-tenampa/" target="_blank">Salón Tenampa</a>. The only thing you drink there is tequila and only by the shot. All the better to get drunk enough to sing along. I’m still a big fan of mariachi. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mofzQYHbOw" target="_blank">“Volver, volver, volver a tus brazos otra vez. . .”</a> </p>
<p>I didn’t go home to Chicago much during this period. The Christmas holiday is the one time I always went back to cold, snowy Chicago. After a while the city seemed so much less warm than Mexico. I always picked up a bottle of very good tequila &#8212; something different each time but always an añejo &#8212; for Christmas at Maria’s and shots with her father. Each year I also bought Cuervo’s annual Reserva de la Familia special edition tequila in a wooden box hand-painted by a Mexican artist. My favorite one is <a href="http://www.cuervo.com/products/box.aspx?artist=grabados-de-artemio" target="_blank">the first, 1997</a>, by Artemio Rodriguez because it’s a typical Mexican drawing, white on blue.</p>
<p>There’s a bottle of <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a> in my cabinet now. There’s also a bottle of Cuervo for margaritas and one of those long, tall, blue bottles containing <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/reposados/corralejo-tequila-reposado.html" target="_blank">Corralejo Reposado</a>.</p>
<p>I have my tequila but I do miss <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/02/02/special-for-forbes-a-business-travel-story-about-mexico/" target="_blank">Mexico</a> mucho.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am mainly a beer drinker, but I like to say I am an “equal opportunity drinker,” so I will try anything once. </p>
<p>When I was prepping for my recent journey to the Keweenaw Peninsula (some 550 miles away from me in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula), I reached out a friend who attended college in the area.</p>
<p>He gave me a detailed list of destinations, attractions, and bars. It was more than enough to go on for my short visit. Then, a few days before I was to set out on my trip, he sent me another email. It contained a simple message:</p>
<p>“Go to Shute&#8217;s in Calumet and have a drink called a Moscow Mule.”</p>

Delicious.”</p>
<p>It sounded good to me. I’m a fan of ginger beer on its own, and bringing vodka to the party would only add to the fun.</p>
<p>Fast forward several days, and I was in Calumet with my girlfriend Steph, and we found Shute’s resting on a corner. It was an old, thin building—but long. It was built in the 1800s during the hay day of copper mining.</p>
<p>We walked in and were amazed by the interior. The bar maintained its Victorian feel and look: dark wood, murals, a glass awning over the bar. A young bartender asked for our order, and I quickly replied “Two Moscow Mules.” He seemed both pleased and surprised by the request, because we stood out like tourists. </p>
<p>I watched him make the drinks, and moments later, they were before us, in copper mugs as my friend promised. The first sip was glorious and refreshing&#8211;it was a hot, sunny day outside. The ginger and lime masked any flavor of the vodka, letting me know this drink could prove dangerous and sneak up on me. </p>
<p>We chatted with the bartender, as we were especially interested in the copper mugs. “I usually ask for a driver’s license to hold when I make those.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked between sips.</p>
<p>“We had a couple of them walk away this winter. And they are $25 a piece.” This price was later confirmed when Steph and I visited a nearby gift shop. </p>
<p>The bartender went on to share more about the drink: it is actually a double shot of vodka, which happened to be Five O’Clock, and he did a slow count while pouring. He had to use Vernor’s ginger ale, as real ginger beer was too expensive, and they were already undercharging at $4 a pop (Travel Tip: you can drink for cheap in the Keweenaw).</p>
<p>While we finished our drinks, the bartender shared some of the history of the bar, the town, and of the early days of mining. History was all around us in Calumet.</p>
<p>It was my first Moscow Mule, and it was worth the drive from Lansing. It will be a drink, and a moment, I will always remember.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My birthday weekend started out so tame. A turkey dinner and a cake with candles with my family, and lots of cooking-related gifts, including <a href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com/kitchen-and-food/blenders/cuisinart-smartstick-hand-blender/s458317">this</a>. Went home full, loved. The next day, my cube at work was filled with gifts, flowers, a balloon, and cupcakes. I was feeling all warm and fuzzy. One of my friends suggested going out for drinks. Why not? For the first time in many years, it wasn’t raining or snowing on my birthday, and the rooftop patio of the nearby Mexican place was open. Oh, happy day.</p>
<p>I got there early, and started off with a margarita. Harmless. Mostly. As my friends started to arrive, we switched over to sangria. We ordered chips and salsa, and then later nachos, but forgot to actually eat dinner. Imagine—me, forgetting to eat. Who am I? Then, we stopped counting sangria in glasses and started counting in carafes. Then I lost count.</p>
<p>I never drank in high school. I probably would have, if my friends had, but none of us did. No one believes me when I tell them that, but I can’t be the only one who waited until college to fall off the wagon. I’d seen the damage that drunk drivers can do and have family members who I worry about. I wanted to be in control of myself at all times. I was self-righteous as hell. Already, I was thinking about the fact that someday, when my kids say, “Well, it’s not like <em>you</em> didn’t drink in high school,” I can say “Actually Jimmy, I didn’t! You can choose to say no!” If you have the urge to slap me at this point, I don’t blame you. Someone needed to tell me to lighten up.</p>
<p>My freshman year of college, I didn’t hesitate to tell people that I didn’t drink. I’d hoped that people would see it as a point of pride and that my choice to be sober wouldn’t be a negative reflection on my character. But it was. I didn’t realize that at a large state school, “I don’t drink” is code for “I’m really boring and you definitely don’t want me at your party.” I didn’t keep a car on campus, so I couldn’t even earn points as a designated driver.</p>
<p>It was terrible. During a time when I was dying to make new friends, people couldn’t stay far enough away from me. One night, one of my few good friends said “We’re all going out to a party tonight. It’s going to be great!” I spent a long time getting ready, and was waiting on the couch when my friend came in the door. She asked to use my mirror, and I gathered up my lip gloss and keys. As I stood up to walk out with her, she said “Bye!” and left. I’d never been invited in the first place.</p>
<p>At the end of freshman year, I had my first drink at a party with some high school friends. It was a fuzzy navel, and I held my boyfriend’s hand the whole time. I sort of wanted to get wasted, so I could forget about how I’d lost my resolve, but I didn’t feel much of anything from the weak drink and went home empty.</p>
<p>By sophomore year, I’d found friends who still invited me out even when I didn’t feel like drinking. And it took them for me to realize that drinking could be fun, especially if you didn’t feel like you <em>had</em> to be drinking. I became an expert. I learned the rules of beer pong and flip cup and which cheap vodkas were worth drinking and which weren’t. I learned about hangovers. But I never once passed out or blacked out or vomited in public, even when I was in Spain, where we were drinking in the plaza more nights each week than I care to admit.</p>
<p>After all that self-righteousness, it turned out that I <em>liked</em> drinking. For someone as shy as me, two drinks erase that crippling self-doubt. I can make friends with strangers or do a runway walk through the bar or sing karaoke. But as a writer, I always wanted to be very, very careful. I never had more than one drink while I was writing. I was afraid of becoming dependent on alcohol to make me feel outgoing or to keep away the anxiety at the blank page on my computer screen. I was afraid of discovering that I liked my writing better when I was drunk. I was afraid of discovering that I liked my drunk self better. The person I was freshman year had plenty of valid reasons for not drinking. She never wanted to forget herself completely—only a little.</p>
<p>But oh red wine, thou art a cruel bitch. On my birthday, I blacked out for the first time. I don’t remember getting home, but I think I may have thrown up on the train. I somehow ended up with a glass from the bar in my purse. I was sick for hours when I did get home. I couldn’t go to work the next day. Freshman-year me is all YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT. Had I done this in college, I could’ve saved the story for a time when I’m meeting some people who are jerks but who I still irrationally want to impress. I could truthfully start a story with “Man, I was sooo wasted last night.” But I’m not in college. Now it’s something I’m embarrassed to write about. It’s just pretty fucking sad.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first or the worst hangover I’ve had, but it’s the first time I felt out of control. That night made me think about drinking and what the point is. Sure, alcohol makes me a little less anxious when I’m out, but in no way does that make the next day any better. Even when you’re not in college anymore, drinking still makes you cool. Especially in writing circles, I feel like I need to be willing to get drinks. To get drunk. I like to say that I like to drink whiskey straight (I do, but it’s almost more fun to say it than to drink it). That glass serves as a drug to make us forget how terrifying it is to meet new people. That glass serves as a signal—I’m social. I’m not uptight. You might like talking to me. The trick is knowing when to put that glass down.</p>
<p>I was thinking today that perhaps I’d rather not be cool. I don’t think I was fooling anyone, anyway. In the meantime, no more sangria. Maybe forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living in a college town, when you are still young enough to occasionally be confused with the undergrads and happen to be a grad student yourself (even though you are going to school on nights and weekends while holding down a full-time job), it&#8217;s not easy to admit this. In fact, what I am about to disclose doesn&#8217;t seem to go over well when you fall into the category of single at any sexually viable age.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to drink.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like going to the bar. I especially dislike it when someone asks me to meet them for drinks as part of the dating process. It isn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t appreciate good alcohol, because I do. A well-mixed cocktail with a house-made infusion is something I&#8217;m likely to order while out to dinner. I&#8217;ve spent a shameful amount of money on fine scotch. I enjoy trying microbrews. In my apartment, there are usually several bottles in the wine rack, a few beer options in the fridge, and a prominent liquor selection displayed near my entryway. But I have a confession. The same beer sits in my fridge for months unless I have people over. The bottles of wine collect dust until I have company, too. I bought the liquor because I find the bottles aesthetically pleasing and they reflect light nicely on this antique mirrored tray I found, especially with the set of cut crystal tumblers I have. </p>
<p>Alcohol is something that I like the idea of more than I like the reality of. A cold beer on a hot summer day at the ballpark can be wonderful&mdash;for the first sip. If I have the entire beer instead of a water, and we are sitting in the sun, I am going to still want the water and end up with an instant headache, then need to miss part of the game to wait in line to pee. The delicious pitcher of sangria split over conversation with a friend will invariably leave me massively hung over the next morning. Hung over means more than vaguely uncomfortable anymore. It means water-retention: bloating and visible puffiness in the face. It means a splitting, sneaky late-afternoon headache after I thought I had gotten away unscathed. My tolerance was definitely higher as a college student that imbibed regularly, but I am starting to wonder if at some point I just accepted these discomforts without question because they seemed merely a part of the cycle and the process in that particular social environment. So maybe I simply chose not to be in tune with what it does to my whole system. With adult responsibilities, I certainly notice it now. My free time is invaluable, and I don&#8217;t want to spend hours that I could sneak in a workout or thoroughly enjoy a new book curled up on the couch, half-interested in a shitty movie and sipping Alka-Seltzer.</p>
<p>My reasons go well beyond this, though. What I&#8217;ve offered thus far is just the easiest explanation.</p>
<p>Recreational drinking is a lot like recreational eating. We have social norms about sharing food and meeting for drinks&mdash;they tend to be the two default options for spending time with other people. They both tend to result in over-indulgence and offer a buffer for the actual visit. Eating and drinking both give you something to do with your hands and your mouth that cut down on awkward silences and give you a sense of purpose in the moment. I am eating. I am drinking. There is less pressure to just talk, because you are also doing something functional.</p>
<p>Alcohol isn&#8217;t good for you. There are studies that show that a glass of wine can actually be good for your heart, or that hops have nutritional benefits. Well, other safely ingested items also contain these beneficial properties without all of the empty calories. It&#8217;s never going to be the best choice for any form of health benefit. Alcohol is a simple carbohydrate. It gets converted to fat quickly if the energy isn&#8217;t used immediately. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t tend to pre-drink as a warm-up for exercise. I tend to drink while seated. I tend to remain seated until I decide I am unfit for public and need to retire to bed. In the past, there was sometimes the activity of embarrassing dancing or inadvisable horizontal recreation, but now I prefer to be sober for those endeavors. Crazy, I know. Truth be told, I find awkwardness very revealing, and often endearing. If you can&#8217;t weather the potential discomfort of being naked, literally or metaphorically, then you should probably not be doing certain things in the first place.</p>
<p>All of this said, it is a challenge to sidestep drinking as soon as you are of legal age. The bar is where people tend to want to meet, especially singles. Ordering drinks with dinner has some tag of hipness attached to it, like you never quite get over the assertion that you CAN order alcohol. And I am finding that the peer pressure associated with drinking is strikingly similar to the people you know who are likely to passively sabotage your attempts at healthy eating or portion control. It often comes from those same people. They want to imbibe and they would feel more comfortable if you did, too. Or they don&#8217;t want to go out alone. </p>
<p>Drinking alone and eating alone are similarly seen as pitiable by those that would never dream of doing either if at all avoidable. I have never really enjoyed drinking alone, but I live alone so lo and behold, most of my meals occur alone. One has to eat. In the process of these meals consumed in solitude, there has been a healthy shift away from seeing eating as a social event and starting to connect food more with fuel. But it means that I am getting protective of my routine and it can be really difficult for me to be confronted with the food issues of others because I have worked so hard to address my own. It is not always easy to prevent your decisions about food from being influenced by those around you. Someone orders dessert and it makes you feel entitled to it, too, even though you are already full to bursting. . . someone asks you to share dessert so you feel like a party pooper declining. . . same with appetizers. Or shots at the bar. Do you really want to be the lame one? The answer for me is becoming a resounding YES 90% of the time. Part of me can&#8217;t wait to grow into the middle-aged woman with the confidence to make these decisions and choose not to notice how they make others uncomfortable. You know why it makes other people uncomfortable? If you actively choose to do the right thing for you, they are confronted for a moment with whether or not it is actually the wisest choice for them, too. And if someone is trying to cut loose, they don&#8217;t want to consider that.</p>
