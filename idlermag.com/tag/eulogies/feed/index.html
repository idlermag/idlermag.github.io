										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leviathan</em> (2012) straddles the line between documentary and avant-garde; composed entirely from footage shot on a large fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean, it hints at how life is lived on the boat, but exists primarily as a visual and auditory experience. Things happen, but there is no plot; our understanding is entirely derived from the images, sound, and what understanding (little, in my case) we might have of industrial fishing.</p>

<p>The film begins, incongruously, with a Bible verse, written in a Gothic-tribal font, then cuts to a black screen with the sound of the ocean churning. A light flickers in the bottom corner of the image, and eventually, we find ourselves on board a massive fishing boat, all clinking chains, painted metal, and winches. During the first ten minutes, we witness, through a camera strapped to one of the workers, the process of bringing up a net that’s been trawling the ocean, and then releasing the mass of slippery silver and pink fish caught in the trap. This labor feels, well, laborious, and has only just begun &#8212; when the sequence ends, we notice that light just barely turned the sky from black to navy blue.</p>
<p>The excitement and movement of the opening sequence belies the repetition and drudgery of the work to come. In two later sequences, the camera lingers on the men cleaning the fish, gutting and beheading them with an efficiency that comes from experience. To those unaccustomed to slaughter, the scene is almost enough to turn one to vegetarianism. As the men work, the camera pans down the side of the wooden bin where the newly caught fish are kept, awaiting their fate, to find it caked and dripping with gore. A group of skates are equally doomed; as a fisherman unceremoniously lifts one with meat hooks, another hacks off its wing-like fins and tosses them into a bin. The waste of the fish – heads, guts, and fins – is dumped back into the sea. With the camera sitting on the ship’s steel floor, a fish’s head sits upside down; its bulbous eye stares back at us, as if prompting a response. Then, we cut to another camera half-submerged in the sea, sometimes underwater, other times emerging into the air, as fish viscera slides out the side of the ship in a red sludge. If ever one needed a visual illustration of the term “biomass,” <em>Leviathan</em> offers it.</p>

<p>Matching the unsentimental vision of the labor needed to help feed a population eager for seafood, who in turn are shielded from the violence involved in securing those meals, is a vision of the sea as vast and all-encompassing. Shots where the camera is plunged into the water offer little but darkness and the muffled reverberations of the ship, interrupted only by the white streaks of the wake and the occasional offal. The film’s soundtrack of crashing waves, winches and chains, and the deep rumble of the engines takes on an ominous musical quality in these scenes; so much so that I imagined incidental music emerging just under hearing.</p>
<p>Whereas the scenes of labor lull you with a sense of repetition, the “underwater” sequences transform the sea into an aesthetic, where you glimpse only the occasional recognizable object &#8212; a chain, a fish, seagulls when the lens breaks the surface. <em>Leviathan</em> is one part <em>Jeanne Dielman</em> (1975), and one part <em>Dog Star Man</em> (1961-1964), though even together those films are not quite the right comparison. There is something more real, and more accidental, about <em>Leviathan</em>, something to do with the primal in the midst of the industrial. One of the last shots of the film shows one of the fisherman seated in the ship’s kitchen; the garbage from his finished meal litters the table and he looks towards us but slightly off-screen. It sounds like he’s watching <em>Deadliest Catch</em>, and what we can hear &#8212; dramatic music, narration, editing &#8212; differs so greatly from the experience we’ve just had. As the show continues, the fisherman slowly closes his eyes, obviously exhausted from his work, and the television cuts to a commercial for a colon cleanser &#8212; two final reminders of biological reality in this strange approximation of home, deep in the bowels of the floating factory. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Roger Ebert was the first film critic I read seriously. For years as a teenager I awaited his reviews every Friday, and his was the first collection of film criticism I ever bought. He taught me that one could disagree with accepted wisdom about a film, and reach one’s own conclusion about it; moreover, he taught me how to defend that opinion. I remember disliking David Lynch’s <em>Blue Velvet</em> (1986) because of Ebert’s review, and after seeing it years later and revising my opinion, his influence remained, because now the lesson had stuck &#8212; my conclusion was my own. Although I read him less in recent years, he appeared still as a model of someone who believed in both cinema and humanity. Although it is sometimes difficult to retain a trust in either, this is another of Ebert’s lessons worth remembering.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, as many will no doubt know, MCA from the Beastie Boys passed away from a battle with cancer.  The loss was one that took many by surprise; cancer may be a killer of many yet when it strikes someone down the fear associated with the illness comes on strong. Now by the time this is published the news will have been in the mist for close to a week. The initial shock will have worn off, the tributes will dilute and mean less than they did upon first discovering this terribly sad news. Anywhere you visited online had a tribute or another. And how long did it take for these tributes and news to lose any impact? 24 hours? 36? How long do we grieve for the famous nowadays? Maurice Sendak just died Tuesday at 83. How long until the name is just that, a name of a man who wrote beloved books that we all know? How do we grieve in the digital age? How long is it ok? If we vent into the echo chamber of social media does the pain diminish, does it fade sooner? </p>
<p>This is a music column. What the hell does this have to do with anything? I suppose I should pay tribute to MCA, the artist and member of the Beastie Boys. I’m 37, and I first heard the Beastie Boys the same time as everyone else my age: on MTV on the back of <em>Licensed To Ill</em>. I remember driving into Baltimore late one night as a kid on a family trip listening to the song &#8220;Girls.&#8221; I loved that tape, loved all the videos the band produced, loved the snotty personae. I was 12, in middle school. I remember hearing that tape in a science class, listening in the classroom. Unwittingly through this tape I began to lay an invisible framework for my future tastes in music. I recently heard &#8220;Rhyming and Stealing&#8221; for the first time in an eternity. I had completely forgotten that the intro sample is from Led Zeppelin’s killer cover of Memphis Minnie’s &#8220;When The Levee Breaks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moving out of middle school I recall buying the cassette EP <em>Love American Style</em> at Record Land in East Lansing. I recall walking home with the tape and then listening to it (I didn’t have a walkman until I was a senior in high school). &#8220;Hey Ladies&#8221; makes me think of summer, it always will, yet the one song that stood out for me is called &#8220;33% God.&#8221; Basically it is the instrumental version of &#8220;Shake Your Rump.&#8221; I have to confess that I didn&#8217;t own <em>Paul’s Boutique</em> until years after it was released. When I finally got into that CD and listened I noticed that the big scratch break in &#8220;Shake Your Rump&#8221; was missing from the CD and was only in the video and on &#8220;33% God.&#8221; Strange but true. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BptQHAW2T5M?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3DAgJjZOhs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><em>Check Your Head</em> is a classic, seminal release. Everybody knows this, and the CD to me IS high school. The sound, that sense of cool, that sense of dress. This CD opened up my eyes to <em>Paul’s Boutique</em> and soundtracked many warm nights in my own mind. I loved &#8220;So What’cha Want.&#8221; That beat felt oppressive and welcoming. Years later unpacking CDs at the bookstore I marveled at the cheek of Beck to sample the song on his song &#8220;E-Pro.&#8221; I had the CD single for the song, and on that disc was a lost gem from the band: &#8220;The Skills To Pay The Bills.&#8221;  After (foolishly) selling that CD it took me eight years to get the song again, this time as part of the short lived MusicMaker CD burning service in conjunction with the band’s greatest hits. The song remains a fine piece of work.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVzgdGuE3KA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><em>Ill Communication</em> was the last Beasties LP that I bought before I got my record store job. I was 19 and shopping at Flat Black &amp; Circular. I don’t remember the circumstances (but I do remember the old location with no windows) of discovering the record had come out before the CD, but I do remember shopping and not seeing the LP on the rack. My brother asked and one was pulled from behind the counter. I took it home, opened it up, marveled at the green vinyl and began to listen to the disc. Over and over and over. I remember the smells of early summer, the first rays of late sunlight. When the CD was released I bought it, and I bought the release on tape. The cassette tape was green. By this point part of the appeal of the band was not only their points of reference but also the samples in their music. &#8220;Root Down&#8221; sampled &#8220;Root Down&#8221; by Jimmy Smith, a song I always opened my Afternoon Jazz show with some 11 years later. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJjuwutaCxQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><em>Hello Nasty</em> came out four years later. Wherehouse got our stock on the Friday before the release date. Most new releases arrived on Saturday, but not this one. I called my co-worker Doug and left him a message. He showed up within ten minutes, gigantic grin on his face. We exchanged a high five, maybe even a bro hug, as we both bought the CD and then started to play it over the store hi-fi. That is what you did; you drummed up business by word of mouth and by playing something during customer hours. If someone picked up on what he or she were hearing you talked them into coming back. At the time I remember listening and relistening to the references and samples, but also the styles of music on the disc. I had it in my head that the band had become futurists, and that music would eventually bend towards the styles on this disc. I don’t think I was right in that assumption but I do remember strongly voicing that point to whomever asked about the disc. As with each release there were more little things that I noticed within the music that piqued my ears and caused thrills. There is this little upwards horn sample loop on the song &#8220;Unite&#8221; that always makes me smile, as well as a wacky sample in &#8220;Body Movin&#8221; of &#8220;Oyo Como Va&#8221; which just destroys in such a short bit. And then the disc ends with a song that sort of haunts me: &#8220;Instant Death.&#8221; Adam Horowitz had suffered some loss and it showed on this song. It is slow, calm, gentle and powerful. When I read that MCA passed away it was the first song I thought about.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/21073395?title=1&amp;byline=1&amp;portrait=1" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>
<p>For myself and my ears the band stops with this music, fourteen years ago now (can that be accurate?). There have been releases since <em>Hello Nasty</em> (<em>Sounds of Science</em>, <em>5 Bouroughs</em>, <em>Hot Sauce Committee</em>) that have come and gone but haven’t stuck in my head. This is not to say that I have been living in a Beastie-free world, only that at some point our paths diverged. And that is ok. </p>
<p>It has been a week now since the passing of Adam Yauch. The tributes have grown silent and the news has moved onwards, ever forward to the next story, the next loss, the next thing. The impact, if any, of the loss is already gone, already an afterthought, already yesterday’s papers. This is grief in this age of ours: the age of social media, of 24-hour news, of the Internet. Musicians pass away all the time. There will always be tributes. But those tributes used to feel as though they lasted longer. Maybe that is ok, the speed with which we move on from news like this. Maybe it is not ok. Why do we feel the need to eulogize the famous, to celebrate their own achievements that impacted our own lives? It is easier to do this, to cast warm thoughts and reflections on people we don’t know. It is safer.</p>
<p>Eddie Izzard commented once, in relation to Princess Diana, that his mum died when he was a child and no one gave a shit. My own family suffered a loss before Christmas, one that I am myself only slowly getting over and moving on. The closure or whatever that took me four months or so takes, what, seven days for the famous? Not even seven days, more like three or four. Is that ok? Are his band mates, friends and family for thirty years, doing ok? Are they going to be able to move forward? What about his wife? What about his child? We, the grand We, do not care about these facts, these family members. We only care about the art created and the memories generated. We take what we need and want from celebrity and when their time is gone we pay tribute and then we move on and we forget. I liked his band. I liked his causes. I don’t care that a musician died of cancer. I care that a father, husband, son, and friend of others died at 47. I hope that for those who now have this void in their lives that the epicenter of their grief is non-toxic and I hope that the grief lessens naturally and healthily. My hope is for Adam Yauch’s child to grow up with the memory of the love of his father in his heart and in his head. In the end no amount of music, no amount of celebrity can come close to what that means.</p>

On May 16, manager Sparky Anderson appeared on the CBS Morning News with owner Tom Monaghan. It wasn&#8217;t their first national interview: ever since Jack Morris no-noed the White Sox in Chicago live on NBC to go 4-0, everyone had wanted to talk to Sparky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again the same questions,&#8221; Sparky complained. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, though; the nation is getting to know the Detroit Tigers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sparky presciently kept a daily diary for the 1984 season, which was published as <em>Bless You Boys</em> after the Tigers won the World Series. On May 16, after the news interview, the Tigers beat the Mariners 10-1 to go 29-5 for the season. It wasn&#8217;t just the winning that made the team special, but the combination of grace and tenacity with which they played. Center fielder Chet Lemon coined a saying in April that became the team&#8217;s motto: &#8220;We mad and they don&#8217;t even know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the 16th, Sparky writes about Alan Trammell&#8217;s sore shoulder and Milt Wilcox&#8217;s pitching, how Aurelio Lopez and Willie Hernandez brought it home. But he also writes that he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t really enjoy the game&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>My daughter, Shirlee, called to tell me about Daddy. There&#8217;s a large tumor on his lung. She cried like a baby on the phone. I told Shirlee to say a prayer to herself and somehow, Grandpa will know.</p>
<p>I have to admit I felt like crying myself. I know why I love Daddy so much. He had no education and he was only a laborer, but everything he did, he did for his family.</p>
<p>Here I am on top of the baseball mountain, but without this one man who never went to school and never had any money, I would never be where I am.</p></blockquote>
<p>His father would have an operation to remove the tumor from his lung the next day: 11AM in California, 2PM in Detroit. Sparky closes the day&#8217;s diary entry with &#8220;Please, God, help the doctors work this out.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sparky Anderson was 50 years old when he wrote that. The year before, on April 6, his son Albert was in a horrible accident. Sparky writes about that, too, on its anniversary:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was on this day in 1983 when my son, Albert, drove off a cliff and fell 800 feet to the bottom of a canyon back home in California. He was unconscious for nine hours. Then, miraculously, he woke up and walked home. He had a broken sternum and cuts all over his body, but we were thankful he suffered no brain damage or internal injuries.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way he should be here now&mdash;but God saved him. I told Albert that April sixth changed his daddy&#8217;s life. I went home and looked down that canyon. I remember looking up and saying, &#8220;God, I don&#8217;t know why you spared him, but I tell You this has changed my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>I want to win as much as anyone. But nothing about this game will ever bother me after that. I get upset over a loss now, but only for the moment. I think I&#8217;m a much stronger person for that.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tigers beat the White Sox in the Sox&#8217;s home opener that day&mdash;in those first nine games, they beat everyone in their home opener&mdash;and Morris no-hit them the next day.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On May 17, the Tigers were off. Sparky waited for word from California about his father.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think about when your Daddy is dying? How do you keep your mind on anything else?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the best entry in the book.</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought about playing ball across the street when Ralph&#8217;s Market parking lot was the best stadium in the world. I remember how Daddy threw to me on the lawn and pulled so hard for us when we played American Legion ball. I even remembered when we lived in Bridgewater, South Dakota, next to the jail that was never locked.</p>
<p>The two o&#8217;clock operation never came. Instead there was a phone call from Mama. The sound of her voice told the whole story. Before the operation began, Daddy&#8217;s heart gave out. He fell back on the table. He didn&#8217;t suffer at all, and that would have made him happy. Daddy didn&#8217;t want anyone to worry about him.</p>
<p>He never hurt a soul. He always told me, &#8220;Be nice to people. It&#8217;ll never cost you a dime. Courtesy and honesty are free.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget that lesson. I&#8217;ll never be able to talk with Daddy or see his face again. But I&#8217;ll never lose him.</p>
<p>Daddy is dead. He was 74.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sparky and his wife Carol flew to California that night, leaving the team in the hands of pitching coach Roger Craig. They went 3-0 against the Oakland A&#8217;s in Detroit, with the first game cut short because of rain and the second two decided by just one run each. Sparky writes, &#8220;I checked on the Tiger score, just to see who won. We beat the A&#8217;s, and I knew Daddy would have liked that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sparky joined the team in Anaheim, where they won three straight against the Angels to go 35-5. In between, the Tigers played Sparky&#8217;s old team, the Reds, in an AL-NL exhibition game. He won two titles with the Big Red Machine, and then was fired, and he was still mad about it. Detroit played all backup players and won 3-2; instead of gloating, he quietly observes, &#8220;That sure shows our depth.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In between, too, was his father&#8217;s funeral. Sparky&#8217;s dad was buried in a Detroit shirt with a blue Tiger emblem and a championship ring he&#8217;d worn since 1949. Sparky had received it for being batboy on the Hollywood Stars&#8217; Pacific Coast League championship team.</p>
<p>In the 30s and 40s, long before the American and National Leagues came to California, the Pacific Coast League was amazing, producing stars<br />
like Joe Dimaggio, Ted Williams, and others. Without the PCL, Sparky would never have played ball in the parking lot at Ralph&#8217;s, would never have played for the Stars&#8217; archrival Los Angeles Angels, and never would have dreamed that he would eventually play a year of Major League Baseball, starting at second base for the Philadelphia Phillies, before returning to the minors and then coaching. He wouldn&#8217;t have even been Sparky&mdash;he would have only been George. The name his father gave him, by which everyone outside of baseball knew him.</p>
<p>At the funeral, Sparky&#8217;s mother (who he calls Mama) whispered to his father, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss you, Ole Pal.&#8221; Sparky reports this and writes, &#8220;I knew what friendship was all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>***<br />
Sparky Anderson died today, in California. He was 76 years old.</p>
<p>Sparky won his second back-to-back championship with the Reds in 1976. He liked finding little parallels like that. They made him feel lucky. They made him feel comforted. They made him feel sure.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to miss you, Ole Pal.</p>

<p>It was a piece of notebook paper. It was a little damp &#8212; Ronnie had ferreted it away in his palm after dinner; his mother would not allow it out of the house.</p>
<p>It was a piece of paper signed by Sparky Anderson. The lines of the paper, the scratchy black of what had to have been a Bic medium point ballpoint pen cresting and peaking over the hills and valleys formed when he signed the paper against Ronnie&#8217;s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t kiss Ronnie then &#8212; there was a crucifix on the wall behind us, and Father Erpelding was walking the halls, smoking his pipe. But I knew, in that moment, I&#8217;d been right to let him put his lips on mine in first grade, even if my mother did find out and chastise me, even if my mother didn&#8217;t think it was funny when Ronnie and I glued our hands together with Elmer&#8217;s (we removed the orange cap) in protest.</p>
<p>How precious was that paper! We insisted the church secretary, Mrs. Cassar, make a Xerox copy for us; I kept that faux-Sparky autograph for years. It stayed on the dresser next to my bed even after Ronnie moved away (I remember he told me he was switching schools while we shared the strawberries his mother packed in his metal lunchbox), even after the baseball strike, after all my dogs died and I grew my hair long and then cut it short and then left for college.</p>
<p>Sparky, we know, is dying &#8212; not in that existential, postmodern sense. He is really dying.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember when I realized I&#8217;d lost the autograph. But I&#8217;m certain I wasn&#8217;t sad.</p>
<p>The scrap of paper was a talisman. Once, I hit two triples in a game and saw my name in the local paper the next. I touched the paper again before the next game, and stuck out looking twice.</p>
<p>The scrap of paper was not magic. The name on it was.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because of Sparky Anderson that Jim Leyland wears cleats in the dugout. It&#8217;s because of Sparky Anderson that we now have a battery of bullpen pitchers, from Brian Wilson to Joel Zumaya to the nameless workhorses taking the ball in the third inning. It&#8217;s because Kirk Gibson sulked into Sparky&#8217;s office, intent on kicking his ass after being benched, and got his ass kicked instead, that the Tigers became a team of winners (before becoming a team of losers). It&#8217;s because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Gibson" target="_blank">Sparky did this in Game 5 of the 1984 series </a>that I knew, even as an elementary schooler, that his name on paper was precious:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the <em><a title="Sounds of the Game (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sounds_of_the_Game&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Sounds of the Game</a></em> video, Detroit manager <a title="Sparky Anderson" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparky_Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a> was seen in the dugout, yelling at Gibson, <em>&#8220;He don&#8217;t want to walk you!&#8221;</em> and making a bat-swinging motion with his hands, the universal baseball gesture for &#8220;swing away.&#8221; Gibson got the message, and launched Gossage&#8217;s 1-0 fastball deep into <a title="Tiger Stadium (Detroit)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Stadium_(Detroit)">Tiger Stadium</a>&#8216;s right field upper deck for a three-run homer, icing the game and the Series for the Tigers.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://multimedia.detnews.com/pix/photogalleries/sportsgallery/sparkyanderson/index21.html" target="_blank">because Sparky wore batting gloves</a> on his hands when he argued with umpires.</p>
<p>﻿It&#8217;s because he insisted that every one of his players was better than Mickey Mantle, or Johnny Bench &#8212; it&#8217;s because, growing up in the shadow of Sparky&#8217;s foot hitched up on the dugout steps, we all thought we could be legends, too.</p>
<p>None of that was on the bit of paper. And none of it, really, can be lost.</p>
