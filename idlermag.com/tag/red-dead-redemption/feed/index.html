										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a moment towards the tail end of Rockstar Games&#8217; epic western <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> when, after a long campaign filled with violence, you are finally allowed to return home to your wife and child.  As you ride across the plains the soundtrack swells.  It feels triumphant, sentimental and incredibly cinematic.</p>
<p><div style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption alignright"><em><img class="  " title="Red Dead Sunset" src="https://i2.wp.com/cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2010/10/sunset.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="227" /></em><p class="wp-caption-text">Yeah, she&#039;s a beaut.</p></div> <em>Red Dead</em> is not alone.  Video games in general  have become increasingly cinematic.  They are essentially fulfilling a niche  market the film industry has only toyed with (rather unsuccessfully):  The interactive movie.  But where the film industry failed&mdash;film viewing is  still inherently passive, regardless of the viewer&#8217;s ability choose which scene to view&mdash;the video game industry flourished by actually allowing you to play the &#8220;film&#8221; out.  You become attached to characters like John Marston because you are John Marston.  You control his every move.  If you want to stroll along the  banks of a great lake at sunrise, you can do so. (Yes, I have done this. The  game&#8217;s environment is as beautiful as it is expansive.  Also, I&#8217;m a sensitive  guy.) The story progresses at your whim.</p>
<p>An even more literal example of video game as interactive  movie comes in the form of Quantic Dreams&#8217; <em>Heavy Rain</em>, in which every  decision, from action to dialog choice, affects the games outcome.  <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#8216;s story  involves a serial killer and the four player-controlled characters investigating  the case.   Its emphasis is not on action, but plot progression and character  development. And there is <em>Uncharted 2</em>, which features some of the best video game writing and voice acting I&#8217;ve ever heard, and plays out like an old school action serial in the vein of <em>Indiana Jones</em>.  Films disguised as video games.</p>
<p>This merger of film sensibility and video game interactivity makes for an exciting future in the gaming world.  In the film world, however, it hasn&#8217;t fared quite so well.</p>
<p><div style="width: 394px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="Super Mario Bros." src="https://i2.wp.com/analogmedium.com/blog/2008/04/supermariobros2.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">At least somebody&#039;s having fun. </p></div> In 1993 somebody thought it was a good idea to adapt <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>for the screen.  It&#8217;s a video game about a plumber and his brother battling a giant turtle-dragon thing in order to rescue a princess.  It doesn&#8217;t take a genius to know that that probably wont translate well.  Or how about the dreadful <em>Street Fighter (1994)</em> film, which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme opposite Raul Julia.  Raul Julia?!  Yes,  Raul Julia (RIP).  Ever resilient, Hollywood gave it a second go in 2009 with <em>Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li</em>. It starred Kristen Kreuk, Chris Klein, and Moon Bloodgood.  With an all-star cast like that, how could they have gone wrong?!</p>
<p><em>Mortal Kombat&#8217;s (1995)</em> &#8220;plot&#8221; had several human fighters being transported to an alternate dimension so that they could compete in a mixed martial arts tournament against monsters and evil wizards.  You know, when you say it out loud (or type it) it sounds a little ridiculous, doesn&#8217;t it?  You know what sounds even more <a title="Mortal Kombat Ending" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrvDenYGICM">ridiculous</a>?  Christopher Lambert playing an Asian lightning god, that&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>Speaking of ridiculous, there is 2005&#8217;s<em> Doom</em>, which starred Dwayne &#8220;The Rock&#8221; Johnson and featured a <a title="DOOM POV" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpb13mDBP1I">sequence shot entirely in the game&#8217;s first-person shooter</a> perspective, and <em>House of the Dead (2003)</em>, which features actual video game footage inserted into the film!  2006&#8217;s <em>Silent Hill</em> was arguably one of the better video game to film adaptations, if only for maintaining the game&#8217;s unique style and look, but its nearly incomprehensible story makes for a confusing and ultimately anti-climactic film.</p>
<p>I believe the inherent problem here is video game fans or, more to the point, the film industry&#8217;s perception of video game fans.  They believe that fans simply will not be satisfied with a high quality film that may forsake a few of the games&#8217; details in favor of a better story.  Please, stop making films based on games that won&#8217;t let us forget they are based on games!  Do not try to &#8220;organically&#8221; insert game elements into the film!  It is not clever.</p>
<p>And lastly (I am running into rant territory, after all), please spare us the games based on films as well.  Aside from the LEGO series (<em>LEGO Batman, LEGO Star Wars, LEGO Indiana Jones. </em> Hell, I&#8217;d play<em> LEGO Fargo!</em>), they are lazy, clunky and wholly unnecessary.  Rebuttal?</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a column about backwards compatibility in video game systems, and it’s exploded a bit (in a good way). So while I’m sorting out the pieces, I wanted to put out the one thing that I know for sure. I’m deeply interested in backwards compatibility, and right now to me it’s an important sign of a good system. I find, however, that I do <em>not</em> tend to use backwards compatibility to play the same games again and again. There are some exceptions to this&mdash;I’ve played at least three different versions of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>&mdash;but for the most part I don’t find it fun to pick up old NES games. Most of them aren’t very good, and I’m immediately reminded that I was never very good at them.</p>
<p>I’m excited by the idea of backwards compatibility much more because of that handful of old games that I’ve never played but want to play now. The first Zelda game I played was <em>Wind Waker</em> on the GameCube (no lie), and while I’m not sure I feel a need to play the first two 8-bit Zelda games, I would really love to play <em>A Link to the Past</em> and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>. I want to play <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em>. I really need to give <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> at least one more chance. It was important to me to be able to pick up <em>Red Dead Revolver</em> after playing <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, just as it quickly became important to put it down again. (Seriously, there’s really not much special about <em>Red Dead Revolver</em>.)</p>
<p>I need to play at least one of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games.</p>
<p>I’d also be really interested to hear from other people&mdash;how important is backwards compatibility to you in a game system? What old games do you still play or what old games would you like to play? What system would you be most likely to use? Let me know in the comments or send me an email at craiggav [at] idler-mag [dot] com.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve started playing <em>BioShock</em>, and my first impression&mdash;other than holy crap it takes a long time to install on a PS3&mdash;is that it’s a very <em>lonely</em> game. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> is every bit as violent, but the sandbox environment of <em>RDR</em>, even in the open, empty West, means that you encounter people who are indifferent or even friendly. There are plenty of missions where dozens and dozens of people are shooting, stabbing, or throwing dynamite at you, but you can also ride into town and play cards, have a drink, or walk around and let people say hello. In <em>BioShock</em>, at least in the early stages of the game, everyone you directly encounter is hostile. For a game vaunted for its complex take on morality (I know, I’ll get there when I get to the Little Sisters), it’s actually a bit draining to just shoot at everything without really having to think about it. (And rather different than <em>RDR</em>, where, feeling genuine guilt, <a target="new" href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2010/05/diary-of-casual-gamer-1-getting-lost.html">I once restarted a gaming session after shooting a person I hadn’t even realized was there</a>.)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Playing a new game is like a first date. You're interested but tentative. Something about the game is attractive, and you want to get to know it better. Most of the time, you've even shelled out a dinner-worthy $20-60, but you're still figuring out whether the game is worth a more substantial, long-term relationship.

And sometimes you go on a lot of first dates before you get a second date.

Are there articles in gaming magazines about the dullness, the lethargy, the lack of will to explore a new virtual world that follows a particularly intense gaming experience? If not, then let me be the first unhappy volunteer. <a target="new" href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/08/339/">Last week</a> I wrote about the joy of finishing a great video game. This week every pixel seems less intense, every storyline dull. I no longer care if the character I&#8217;m guiding falls endlessly, screen after screen to his death. I&#8217;m more aggravated by difficult or unresponsive control schemes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really excited to pick up a controller right now.</p>
<p>This will change, of course. It&#8217;s actually a side effect of the depth of immersion possible with some video games today. Part of the pleasure of a game like a good <em>Final Fantasy</em> or <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> is becoming invested in an entire world, getting to know the characters, overcoming challenges, and taking part in an experience that builds as it goes along. I&#8217;ve written in the past about the substantial learning curve of contemporary games, where much of the early portions of the game are devoted to tutorials, but there&#8217;s a learning curve involved in an immersive story as well. It takes time, in effect, for a game to earn its player&#8217;s trust and build a relationship.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why sequels are pervasive in the video game world. It&#8217;s smart business for a developer to make the most of an audience that a game has already built, but the economics make sense on the player&#8217;s side as well. You&#8217;re already invested in the game&#8217;s world, and you have a pretty good idea what you&#8217;re going to get out of the experience. Playing a new game is like a first date. You&#8217;re interested but tentative. Something about the game is attractive, and you want to get to know it better. Most of the time, you&#8217;ve even shelled out a dinner-worthy $20-60, but you&#8217;re still figuring out whether the game is worth a more substantial, long-term relationship.</p>
<p>And sometimes you go on a lot of first dates before you get a second date.</p>
<p>(You may laugh, but I played <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> for four months. I&#8217;ve only dated two people longer than that, and I married one of them.)</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going on first dates right now. I&#8217;m taking the opportunity to get better acquainted with some exciting, attractive games that I couldn&#8217;t pursue because I was spending time with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. I&#8217;m taking a new look at some old friends to see if there&#8217;s the possibility of discovering something more. It&#8217;s fun, but it takes a lot of energy. There are disappointments. Sometimes it&#8217;s the game. Sometimes it&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get there. And I&#8217;ll let you know when I do.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I bought Rockstar Games’ <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> the day it came out, May 18, 2010, and I just finished it this past weekend. Of course, <em>I</em> say that I finished the game. The game itself seems to think that I’m only 85.4% done. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> doesn't end when the credits roll. You can just keep going if you want, playing poker, hunting, gathering rare herbs, helping or assaulting people as your wont may be. I will admit to having done a little of all of these things.

Of course, <em>I</em> say that I finished the game. The game itself seems to think that I’m only 85.4% done. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> doesn&#8217;t end when the credits roll. You can just keep going if you want, playing poker, hunting, gathering rare herbs, helping or assaulting people as your wont may be. I will admit to having done a little of all of these things.</p>
<p>To readers and fellow gamers mired in the southern portion of the game’s virtual geography, I say “press on!” After the initial “New Austin” portion of the storyline, the &#8220;Mexico&#8221; chapters are a bit of a disappointment. Progress is more tentative. The clichés are more offensive. Even though the territory is smaller, one seems to spend more time in transit on one’s horse. There’s an ill-advised stealth portion of the game with unreasonably lethal throwing knives. (Seriously, it can take a couple of shots to stop a guy who&#8217;s trying to kill you, but one throwing knife in the back puts your man down, every time. Are the things poisoned? The game never says anything about poison.)</p>
<p>But when you come back to the US, and gain access to the “West Elizabeth” territory (which is actually the easternmost potion of the game’s geography. Go figure), it’s all worth it. This is where <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>’s early hints that it wants to be a game about the end of the West and the conflict between the open frontier and creeping industrialized bureaucracy really come to fruition. [Let it be said that there are rather severe <strong>SPOILERS AHEAD</strong>, but if you really want some quality spoilers, go to the <a href="http://reddead.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Dead_Wiki">Red Dead Wiki</a>. It’s pretty fabulous.]</p>
<p>Suddenly, in West Elizabeth’s largest town, Blackwater, it starts to feel like 1911 and not the 1870s. The streets are paved. You take a ride in (and make fun of) a car, which, of course, breaks down at a critical moment. You’re able to purchase a pretty sweet full-automatic German Mauser pistol, and you finally get to work face-to-face with the corrupt federal agent who&#8217;s been pulling your strings. (He’s been hovering in the background during the early portions of the game.) But most importantly, after all this, you do actually get your family back. <em>And that’s not where the game ends.</em> </p>

The Clint Eastwood part of the film is about a guy who is probably dead and come back as an angel of death to take retribution on the bad men who killed him and are now hurting other people. Clint puts on a priest’s collar at one point, but he deals out far more ass-kicking than spiritual guidance. Michael Moriarty, on the other hand, is a prospector who is trying to pull his fellow prospectors into some sort of community and build a family with a woman who starts lusting hard after Clint as soon as he rides into town (her daughter too. Lusts after Clint, that is). Moriarty has a nice moment with a shotgun at the end of the film, but mostly he’s the quiet guy with the resolve to pull everyone together. (Did I mention that film is about mining instead of ranching? Not a cow in sight. Brilliant.)</p>
<p>After riding all over the West, killing and being shot at, John Marston gets to go home to his own property and try to reconnect with his family. Even though I knew it was coming, John’s reunion with his wife, Abigail was surprisingly affecting. Abigail, when you meet her, is a great character. She loves John, but she won&#8217;t take any shit from anyone, especially him. She has as much of a past as John does&mdash;she was a &#8220;working girl&#8221; who ran with old gang John has just killed off, and she has mixed feelings about that. In short, she&#8217;s a character worth all of the trouble you&#8217;ve just gone through. (Compare, say, to <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, in its various incarnations. What did Toadstool or Peach ever do for you?) The scene where Abigail meets Bonnie McFarlane, the rancher who saved John’s life and is more than a little sweet on him, is perfectly played. The two women have a lot in common, and like each other. The only sign of Bonnie’s feelings is the way the camera (can we call it the camera?&mdash;the game’s view) lingers on Bonnie as she watches John and Abigail drive away. It’s heartbreaking.</p>

Sandbox games like <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> constantly have to balance the creation of a dynamic where the user can do whatever he wants with the constraints necessary to maintain some semblance of narrative and character consistency. While <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> offers the player a great deal of flexibility as to how violent or how law-abiding John Marston is going to be, the character is written as unwaveringly faithful to his wife. New Austin is full of &#8220;working women,&#8221; but John constantly reaffirms that he&#8217;s a married man. He does not and cannot flirt with Bonnie Marston.  Marston may not exactly be Michael Moriarty in <em>Pale Rider</em>, but he wants to be. Once he goes home and puts on his rancher&#8217;s clothes, he never wears anything else. (The player literally loses the ability to change Marston into different outfits at that point of the game.) He herds cattle. He teaches his son to hunt. He shoots wolves and crows instead of people. He finds a different life, for just a little while.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite <em>Unforgiven</em>, but it&#8217;s worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence.</p>
<p>If I had one complaint (other than Mexico), it’s that I’d like to be able to bump into the characters from the main storyline again in the game’s coda. (You are given brief updates on what happens to most of them in a newspaper you can purchase. Do.) I’d like to know what happens to McFarlane and her ranch. I’d like to get to see her meet Marston’s son. I’ve made an emotional connection with these characters, and that’s an extraordinary thing to be able to say about a game.</p>
