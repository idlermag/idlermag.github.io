<p>Ladies and gentlemen, if you&#8217;ve ever doubted the wisdom of Dombo (not to be confused with the elephant, Dumbo) let this ease your mind.</p>
<p>So the Nationals, another National League club, <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=4262">plunked down an almost unthinkable amount of money for a guy who has never managed to break .300 on the season</a>. And yes, I know that he&#8217;s come close, but if I&#8217;m going to sign a guy to a deal like that&mdash;7 years, $126 million&mdash;I am certainly not going to go all-in on a guy who can&#8217;t break .300 in the NL.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Miguel Cabrera money, but <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=5544">Werth is not putting up Miguel Cabrera numbers in the column that matters most: RBIs</a>.</p>
<p>You want a guy who only hits homers when it doesn&#8217;t matter, or the bases are empty, sign Marcus Thames to a league-minimum deal. You want a guy who&#8217;s not going to choke when you&#8217;ve got runners ready to score? Then Werth is not really your man.</p>
<p>So why is Dombo right to have never even entered the Werth sweepstakes? </p>
<p>Because Werth is a lot like a guy who got a similar contract recently: <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=5940">Matt Holliday</a>.</p>
<p>And when you look at Holliday&#8217;s numbers, you see a pretty obvious trend. When he&#8217;s played in the NL, he&#8217;s been above .300 every year save one&mdash;and that year, he hit .290. But for the half-season he was in Oakland, he hit .286&mdash;worse than his rookie year. He&#8217;s traded to the Cards at midseason, and hits .386. </p>
<p>The worst thing that could have happened for the Tigers would have been a repeat of the Dontrell Willis experience, but with a hitter. Werth, I suspect, is a lot like Holliday, in that they&#8217;re very skilled (in Werth&#8217;s case, somewhat skilled) hitters in the NL, but in the AL. . . well, it&#8217;s better for Werth to stay in the NL. </p>
<p>I mean, look: Holliday had a ONE HUNDRED POINT SWING in his batting average. Just by switching leagues. Now, ok, maybe we can&#8217;t extrapolate that&mdash;it does seem too extreme to be a standard for players of Werth&#8217;s / Holliday&#8217;s ilk when switching to the AL, with it&#8217;s harder-to-master pitching&mdash;but even a fifty point drop would have been disaster.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the Tigers with a big money, big name free agent, who sometimes plays right field and struggles at the plate? And hits, what, .230? No, no you can&#8217;t. Even Johnny Damon, who was slightly disappointing, hit .270. </p>
<p>So who&#8217;s a better bet for the Tigers? There&#8217;s always <a target="new" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/stats?playerId=5035">Carl Crawford</a> who can hit, field, and run. (The Tigers would be wise to add a bona fide baserunner&mdash;teams like the Twins always kill us with the running game.) Or Jim Thome. Or, hey, Magglio Ordonez.</p>
<p>Don’t be sad, Tigers fans. We didn’t miss out on anything but a sure bust. I&#8217;m fairly certain that Werth will continue to nibble around the .300 mark this season, but he&#8217;s not going to make the Nats a contender. Of course, if I&#8217;m Dombo, and I&#8217;m wrong, I can always take solace in the $126 million I didn&#8217;t place on that bet.</p>
