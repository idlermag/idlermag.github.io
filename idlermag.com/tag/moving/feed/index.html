										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to give up on this whole &#8220;my life is a lot like <em>EarthBound</em> right now&#8221; thing, or at least dial it back a little. Really I was. And then last Monday, as I was having pizza with old Lansing friends who no longer live in Lansing at our favorite Lansing pizza place one last time before I left Lansing, I found myself losing my appetite. It wasn&#8217;t the food, which was exactly the way it should have been. I started to get the shivers too. In short, I felt like I&#8217;d been hit by <a href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Li%27l_UFO" target="_blank">a beam that causes night-time stuffiness</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been much a fan of status ailments in RPGs, which always seemed like an arbitrary battle mechanic just for the sake of some added difficulty. As anyone who has ever run into a Malboro in a <em>Final Fantasy</em> game knows, status-inflicting attacks can hit you hard, but the specific statuses always seemed to me rather random. Unless you&#8217;re fighting a medusa (which happens!), a attack that turns the player characters into stone seems like the designers are being mean, rather than an organic combat design element.</p>
<p>By the end of the night, I had a 101.8 degree fever, which persisted through the next few days. My life couldn&#8217;t stop &#8212; the movers were coming, utilities needed to be canceled, daughters needed to get to school and back (I disinfected heavily before each trip, and I&#8217;m a keep-to-myself kind of guy anyway) &#8212; the world needed to be saved, no matter how I felt.</p>
<p>A cold, in <em>EarthBound</em>, costs you HP each time you sneeze, and if you don&#8217;t use the PSI Healing ability or a cold remedy to cure yourself of the status, you continue to lose HP as you walk around even after a battle has ended. Which is a pretty good description of how I felt. I was up and about, I got things done, but every step cost me something.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another noteworthy enemy you run into a little before you start fighting the Li&#8217;l UFOs (which can give Ness a cold) &#8212; the Ramblin&#8217; Evil Mushroom. They&#8217;re not terribly difficult to beat, but they have their own status attack, which leaves Ness with a mushroom growing on his head. This mushroom effect doesn&#8217;t seem to do much at first, but before long, when you tell Ness to walk to the right, he starts walking up, or to the left, or down. Once you get a handle on Ness&#8217;s new control scheme, it changes again, and to keep up you have to keep rotating the controller in your hand. It&#8217;s not impossible to deal with, and I haven&#8217;t found it to have any negative impact in battle, but it&#8217;s, um, weird.</p>
<p>By the middle of the week I was seeing things every time I closed my eyes. It was like the part of me that dreams wasn&#8217;t concerned anymore with whether I had actually fallen asleep or not. The list of things I still needed to do got mashed up with strange images that disappeared as soon as I realized that I might want to remember or describe them. Most of us have a few minutes of that indescribable, hallucinatory state every night, which we forget by the time we wake up again, but for me it was stretched into what felt like hours at a time. I couldn&#8217;t rouse myself, and didn&#8217;t really want to &#8212; I was trying to get to sleep after all &#8212; but it was hard to know where I was, where I was going, or when it would end. It wasn&#8217;t entirely pleasant, but it wasn&#8217;t entirely unpleasant either. When I have a hard time sleeping, I normally find myself rehearsing the things I&#8217;m worried about, running mental lists to make sure that there&#8217;s nothing I&#8217;ve missed or forgotten. In my fever state I was doing something similar, but my rehearsals and lists were mutating into unrecognizable shapes.</p>
<p>I never actually turned on <em>EarthBound</em> this week, but by the end of it, I felt like I understood the game a whole lot better. (I also had a diagnosis of pneumonia, for what it&#8217;s worth. I&#8217;m on antibotics now and feeling much better, thank you.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>EarthBound</em> does not begin with a plane ride. This, to me, right now, is the one place where the game feels wrong. In 1995, a 10-year-old would have been able to get on an airplane alone. (I did, as a 10-year-old, and while I don&#8217;t remember specifically, chances are that I did as a 16-year-old in 1995 as well.) I&#8217;m not totally sure whether Ness should get on a plane at the very beginning, or whether he should start abroad, and then take a plane home after discovering a mysterious meteor. Ness starts the game at home, and a plane ride feels like it would be the perfect vehicle for the sense of dislocation that seems to drive <em>EarthBound</em>.</p>
<p>Ness starts his quest walking around the local town of Onett (yes, I&#8217;m still talking about the beginning, I&#8217;ll come back to that), a normal-ish place with a hotel, a bank, shops, and an arcade. Ness can buy hamburgers, a hat. It all seems perfectly natural, except that the player is seeing all this for the very first time. I don&#8217;t know the streets. I&#8217;ve never seen the people behind the counter before. And the hamburgers don&#8217;t just make you feel good, they restore your health. The hat is armor. The tough-looking kids at the arcade aren&#8217;t just up to no good, they attack you. It&#8217;s all perfectly normal, and perfectly strange.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this week, I got on a plane. A meteor just fell, and my family and I are looking for a new place to live. It feels a bit like we have super powers. We call people and they take us up unfamiliar stairways and unlock new doors. I&#8217;m driving a different car, listening to different sounds beamed in from space. Peanut butter doesn&#8217;t just make me feel good, it keeps me going.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having a hard time distinguishing between my life and the game. I&#8217;m finding myself in places with names like Onett, Found Stone, Happy Happy, Sour Cherry. I&#8217;m looking at the same apartments in different colors. I&#8217;m looking at the same monsters in different colors. I&#8217;m doing things again and again.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this week, I got on a plane. Everything had changed already, but stepping into a pressurized metal tube and bouncing through the air gave me a transition, like a loading screen. I had to wait and look at things. There were stores, but the prices were different. A baseball hat was armor. I talk to people and they say the same things again and again. Things look similar, fall into the same patterns, but everything is totally different.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s a light beneath everything. I&#8217;ve only caught a glimpse of it, and I have a long way to go, but I&#8217;m still chasing after it.</p>
<p>Next week: Back to the game, if I can start telling it apart from my life again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello from the west coast, dear readers, where I wake up three hours later than most of my friends and every day begins foggy and ends up clear-skied and perfect. My boxes are mostly unpacked, except for those ones labeled “?” and “I don’t even know.” (True story.) I sometimes look out the window and expect to see the apartment next door in Boston, only to see blue skies and palm trees. I forget where I am. But I like it here, wherever it is.</p>
<p>Our apartment is tiny, and we don’t have room for a dining room table, so instead we eat sitting across from each other on the couch or at the bar in the kitchen. It feels as cute as college all over again. We plan to get a table for the patio so we can look out at the palm trees and feel all California while we eat.</p>
<p>I’m unemployed, so I’ve yet to make myself stick to a schedule. After the long drive, I spent most of two days on the couch recovering by watching episode after episode of <em>Dexter</em>. I eat cereal in the morning, soup or a sandwich for lunch, and whatever Charlie cooks for dinner. I’m a little lost without my routine. At dinnertime, I tend to sit on the couch and apologize while Charlie does the cooking. He’s a good man, so he never complains, but after reading about all the things I cooked in Boston while he was in California, I must be somewhat of a disappointment.</p>
<p>We’re getting used to sharing an eating schedule again. I like to plan my meals ahead of time; Charlie tends to eat whatever’s in the fridge or whip something up from whatever we have in the pantry. Leftover spaghetti? Great. Omelettes for dinner? Perfect. We don’t feel like cooking? Order some pizzas. Watch more <em>Dexter</em>. I’m the opposite. Example: Yesterday we went to a chili cookoff. While we were waiting in line, before we ate any chili, I was wondering about dinner. I think about my next <em>next</em> meal before I’ve even eaten this one. This morning, though, while we were brushing our teeth, Charlie asked, “What should we have for dinner?”</p>
<p>Because our apartment is newly remodeled, the kitchen is gorgeous and brand-new and FREAKING AWESOME. Go ahead and call me lame, but one of the best parts of this kitchen is that the end of the faucet comes off and works as a sprayer. Cleaning requires little to no effort. (The best kind of effort, obviously.)</p>

<p>Because the apartment’s tiny, storage space is at a minimum. Some shelves are narrow and a good home for nothing but cutting boards and elves. There’s no pantry, so Charlie had set all the cereal boxes and canned food out on the long shelf. It made my obsessive-compulsive need for orderly piles go haywire. I suggested moving the plates and cups out of the cabinets and moving the food in. Plates and cups are inherently prettier. After the switch, the kitchen is indeed prettier and I feel less like tearing my hair out. However, the San Andreas Fault is about 15 minutes west of us. Earthquakes happen all the time, small ones we can barely feel and sometimes bigger ones we can. We haven’t felt one yet, but I’m just waiting for the day I ask Charlie to stop moving the bed and for him to tell me he’s not.</p>
<p>We have wineglasses sitting on an open shelf. Would it be smarter to put them in a cabinet? Probably. But the kitchen looks so adorable with the wineglasses and matching plates that we just can’t bring ourselves to be intelligent and put them somewhere low. We’ll compromise by not hanging anything over the bed. I&#8217;ll have to get used to cooking with the electric stove, rather than the gas I’m used to. But as Charlie pointed out, electric stoves are much safer, you know, in the event of an earthquake. No gas lines means a smaller chance of fire. So, there’s that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have a coupon for free cupcakes downtown. Perfect for an unemployed food writer. Let cupcakes and not earthquakes guide me home.</p>
