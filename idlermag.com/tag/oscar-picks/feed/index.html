										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Best Cinematography:</strong> Matthew Libatique for <em>Black Swan</em>, Wally Pfister for <em>Inception</em>, Danny Cohen for <em>The King’s Speech</em>, Jeff Cronenweth for <em>The Social Network</em>, Roger Deakins for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="True Grit" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/truegrit.gif?w=297&#038;h=198" alt="" width="297" height="198" />My pick:</strong> Roger Deakins for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong>Probable winner:</strong>Jeff Conenweth for <em>The King’s Speech</em></p>
<p><em>Black Swan</em>&#8216;s gritty, realistic visuals provide a striking counterpoint to the madness it contains and Cohen’s use of wide angle lenses and tight close-ups in <em>The King’s Speech</em> make for a unique looking film within a pretty traditional genre. <em>The Social Network</em>&#8216;s look is dark, ambient and cold (in a good way). I’m not sure <em>Inception</em>&#8216;s greatness owes much to the cinematography, but it’s a well-shot film to be sure.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The King's Speech" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/rpowell/pic/001c70t7/s640x480" alt="" width="307" height="205" />Even though I don’t often condone giving an artist an award for past work (unless we’re talking about a lifetime achievement award, of course), Roger Deakins really is about due. I won’t waste time listing all of his work but he’s shot one gorgeous film after another in his <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005683/">long career</a> including nearly every Coen brothers film since <em>Barton Fink</em> in 1991. <em>True Grit</em> is beautiful, subtle and by far my favorite in this category. Jeff Cronenweth will take it.</p>
<p><strong>Best Directing:</strong> Darren Aronofsky for <em>Black Swan</em>, David O. Russell for <em>The Fighter</em>, Tom Hooper for <em>The King’s Speech</em>, David Fincher for <em>The Social Network</em>, Joel &amp; Ethan Coen for <em>True Grit</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="The Social Network" src="https://i0.wp.com/clothesonfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/The-Social-Network_Jesse-Eisenberg-dressing-gown_Image-credit-Columbia-Pictures.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192" />My pick: </strong>David Fincher</p>
<p><strong>Probable winner</strong>: David Fincher</p>
<p>Darren Aronovsky’s commitment to the madness is admirable and Tom Hooper’s unique style adds much to <em>The King’s Speech</em>. O. Russell’s <em>The Fighter</em> looks pretty good, but the fight sequences leave much to be desired, and even though it’s incredibly difficult for me to pass up the Coen brothers here I think the cinematography and performances are the real standouts for <em>True Grit</em>.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Social Network" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.latinoreview.com/images/stories/blu-ray_dvd-screencaps-3/soc-net-end.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="182" />In the end I have to go with what seems to be the popular opinion and give this to Fincher. Keeping such a fast paced, intelligent film under such tight control is impressive and Fincher’s a master.</p>
<p><strong>Best Picture:</strong> <em>Black Swan</em>, <em>The Fighter</em>, <em>Inception</em>, <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, <em>The King’s Speech</em>, <em>127 Hours</em>, <em>The Social Network</em>, <em>Toy Story 3</em>, <em>True Grit</em>, <em>Winter’s Bone</em></p>
<p><strong>My pick: <img class="aligncenter" title="The Social Network" src="https://i0.wp.com/i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2010/10/01/technology/Harvard_Social_Network.fortune/social_network_harvard.top.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="324" /></strong></p>
<p>There’s no need to go into great detail as my previous posts in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/category/the-cinephiles/the-great-oscar-race-the-cinephiles/">The Great Oscar Race</a> already do so. Critics have called this a down year. I suppose they’re somewhat correct. Most of the films in this category are very good, but few are great. Perhaps someone should recommend going from ten to five films? There I go again.</p>
<p>Narrowing this oversized (sorry) category down to a top three was easy for me. <em>True Grit</em>, <em>Winter’s Bone</em> and <em>The Social Network</em> were my clear standouts. But if I had to pick a film that really represents a total package, a perfect storm of cinematic brilliance, if you will, I’d have to take <em>The Social Network</em>. It’s just too well made, too well acted and too damned smart to ignore. It’s also better than a film about Facebook has any right to be.</p>
<p>That being said, <em>The King’s Speech</em> has gained so much momentum at this point that anything else winning (except maybe <em>The Social Network</em>) would be considered a fair sized upset.  We shall see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Probable winner: <img class="aligncenter" title="The King's Speech" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Kings-Speech-Geoffrey-Rush.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="284" /></strong></p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have failed. I have fallen one movie short in the Best Picture category and four short of my overall goal. Thirteen films in three weeks can be tricky business for a married fellow with obligations. Damn you <em>127 Hours</em> for not being as easily accessible as your fellow nominees! Damn you weather for thwarting my attempts to see Michelle Williams’ performance in <em>Blue Valentine</em>! Damn you <em>Rabbit Hole</em> for slipping so far under the radar that even I, a die-hard cinephile, completely forgot that you exist! And lastly, damn me for not making time to see <em>The Illusionist</em>. As a huge Jacques Tati fan I have no excuse. Perhaps I can make up for it?</p>
<p>Until then, I soldier on with my picks, spending more time in categories I feel the most versed in and deferring to rumor and pure vibe in the others.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actor in a Leading Role:</strong> Javier Bardem in <em>Biutiful</em>, Jeff Bridges in <em>True Grit</em>, Jesse Eisenberg in <em>The Social Network</em>, Colin Firth in <em>The King’s Speech</em>, James Franco in <em>127 Hours</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Jeff Bridges" src="https://i1.wp.com/manolomen.com/images/jeff-bridges.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="252" /><img class="alignright" title="Colin Firth" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/files/2011/01/Colin_Firth_and_Barbara_Stockings_cropped.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="249" />My pick:</strong> Jeff Bridges</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner:</strong> Colin Firth</p>
<p>This one’s a no-brainer. Firth has so much buzz at this point that you can’t even hear the other actors’ names. It is deserved, of course. His performance in <em>The King’s Speech</em> is subtle and endearing. Eisenberg is good, but David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin are really the guys carrying <em>The Social Network</em>. Javier Bardem’s role is a little overly sentimental and James Franco is the bleeding host of the show! His odds plummeted the minute they made the announcement.</p>
<p>So why Jeff Bridges? I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that some of it is because I’m a huge Jeff Bridges fan, but I’m always impressed when an actor manages to vanish into a role and I feel like he accomplishes that in his performance as Rooster Cogburn. Sure, he’s a funny, drunken, dirty cowboy. But the real elegance in his performance comes from the more subtle moments, like the slight shift in his demeanor when he watches young Mattie Ross basically will her horse across a river in order to exchange words with him. Unfortunately, Bridges won last year for his equally phenomenal performance in a less phenomenal movie (<em>Crazy Heart</em>) and the Academy isn’t terribly fond of repeats.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actor in a Supporting Role: </strong>Christian Bale in <em>The Fighter</em>, John Hawkes in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, Jeremy Renner in <em>The Town</em>, Mark Ruffalo in <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, Geoffrey Rush in <em>The King’s Speech</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="John Hawkes" src="https://i0.wp.com/images.wikia.com/lostpedia/images/4/42/John_Hawkes.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="320" /><img class="alignright" title="Christian Bale" src="https://i2.wp.com/images.askmen.com/specials/2007_top_49/men/christian_bale.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="290" />My pick: </strong>John Hawkes</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner: </strong>Christian Bale</p>
<p>Mark Ruffalo is charming as the über-cool Paul and Geoffrey Rush is as reliable as ever as the future King’s speech therapist. I haven’t seen <em>The Town</em>, but based on his performance in <em>The Hurt Locker</em> last year I have to imagine that Jeremy Renner is solid. But again I find myself leaning towards the more subtle performance, the one that doesn’t feel like a performance at all, and that’s John Hawkes in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>. This is not as to say that I don’t think Christian Bale deserves recognition for his work in <em>The Fighter</em> as it really is his movie, as far as I’m concerned, and his physical transformations are always impressive. It’s just that I liked <em>Winter’s Bone</em> so much more and John Hawkes is just so damned good as the hard edged, distrustful drug addict, Uncle Teardrop. The main character’s journey may lead her to some sort of catharsis but Teardrop’s is one of near-Shakespearian tragedy, and his final line is a heavy one.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actress in a Leading Role: </strong>Annette Bening in <em>The Kids Are All Right</em>, Nicole Kidman in <em>Rabbit Hole</em>, Jennifer Lawrence in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, Natalie Portman in <em>Black Swan</em>, Michelle Williams in <em>Blue Valentine</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Jennifer Lawrence" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.comicbookmovie.com/images/uploads/Lawrence_sd420080713.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="297" /><img class="alignright" title="Natalie Portman" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/natalie-portman-teeth.jpg?w=231&#038;h=308" alt="" width="231" height="308" />My pick: </strong>Jennifer Lawrence</p>
<p><strong>Probable Winner: </strong>Natalie Portman</p>
<p>This was a tough one for me. Having not seen both <em>Rabbit Hole</em> and <em>Blue Valentine</em> I can only guess as to whether or not they deserve to win it. Meanwhile, I loved <em>Black Swan</em> which contained a daring all-in performance from Natalie Portman, and Jennifer Lawrence’s more subtle portrayal of determined young woman in <em>Winter’s Bone</em>, as well. My heart tells me that I got more satisfaction from the later, but my head tells me that the former is nearly unbeatable.</p>
<p><strong>Best Actress in a Supporting Role: </strong>Amy Adams in <em>The Fighter</em>, Helena Bonham Carter in <em>The King’s Speech</em>, Melissa Leo in <em>The Fighter</em>, Hailee Steinfeld in <em>True Grit</em>, Jacki Weaver in <em>Animal Kingdom</em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignleft" title="Hailee Steinfeld" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.enthunder.com/photo/Hailee%20Steinfeld/Hailee-Steinfeld.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="284" /><img class="alignright" title="Hailee Steinfeld" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.enthunder.com/photo/Hailee%20Steinfeld/Hailee-Steinfeld.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="285" />My pick:</strong> Hailee Steinfeld</p>
<p><strong>Probable winner: </strong>Hailee Steinfeld</p>
<p>Amy Adams is solid as the outspoken girlfriend of “Irish” Mickey Ward in The Fighter, but she’s done even better work in far better films. Melissa Leo is excellent, but her character isn’t strong enough to leap out and Leo may have shot herself in the foot with her odd decision to <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/oscar-melissa-leo-goes-rogue-with-her-own-personal-campaign-ads/">fund her own “For your consideration” ads</a>. Helena Bonham Carter’s part isn’t showy enough no matter how well she played it and I’m not certain that Animal Kingdom got enough attention for Jacki Weaver to snag it.</p>
<p>This is another no brainer for me: Hailee Steinfeld. It’s a shame she was nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar when <em>True Grit</em> was clearly her film, but I’d imagine that injustice will not weigh on her much as she’s giving her acceptance speech.</p>
