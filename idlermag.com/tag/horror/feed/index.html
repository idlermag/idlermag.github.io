										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d like to clear up a bit of a myth &#8212; you can actually follow either <em>Animal Man</em> or <em>Swamp Thing</em> without reading the other. Writers Jeff Lemire and Scott Snyder have clearly spent the first year of the two titles building a common world with a number of common elements and themes, but they each have their own plan. Together, the two titles considered together form a dark, rich tapestry, but they&#8217;re each outstanding titles on their own. You don&#8217;t have to read both <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em>, although I can&#8217;t imagine why you wouldn&#8217;t want to.</p>

<p>At first glance, Buddy Baker and Alec Holland don&#8217;t have much in common. Baker is a sometime actor and stuntman who has embraced his public role as Animal Man not just to fight crime, but to be an advocate for animal issues. He&#8217;s married with a son and a daughter, and while his acting career has never really taken off, he&#8217;s just starred in a little indie film which is garnering a some attention and even a hint of Oscar buzz. In the pages of <em>Animal Man</em>, there&#8217;s an ongoing contrast between the humble, salt-of-the-earth (I&#8217;m trying to avoid the phrase white trash) nature of the Baker family, and the way modern media occasionally intrudes on the story &#8212; the first page of the first issue of <em>Animal Man</em> is a faux interview with Buddy Baker from the deeply hip magazine <em>The Believer</em>, and most of the sixth issue consists of scenes from Baker&#8217;s indie film <em>Tights</em>, as viewed on Baker&#8217;s son&#8217;s smartphone while the family is on the run in their RV.</p>

<p>Alec Holland, on the other hand, is a renowned plant biologist who in the first issue of <em>Swamp Thing</em> is working in construction. He&#8217;s recently returned to life after a lab explosion years ago to find not only that his wife wasn&#8217;t so lucky, but that he shares memories with a monstrous superhero animated by a force known as the Parliament of Trees using what they were able to salvage of Holland&#8217;s personality after his death. The Parliament now wants Holland to become their champion himself as they had always intended, and he feels the unwanted pull of that destiny in both his waking hours and in his dreams.</p>
<p>But for all their differences, Baker and Holland have one thing in common. Their lives have been shaped and directed by forces that are beyond anything they had ever imagined, and the first year of each of their titles can be read as an extended cinematic pull back shot. In every issue, the frame expands a little, revealing a world bigger, deeper, stranger, and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In the New 52, Animal Man and Swamp Thing are revealed to be champions (&#8220;avatars&#8221;) for the constantly battling forces of animal and plant life, known as The Red and The Green, both of which oppose the embodied force of death known as The Rot. In times of balance, each of the three forces keeps the others in check. If things were in balance, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have much of a story, and both titles at the inception find themselves in a place where the way things are is far from the way things should be.</p>
<p>In <em>Animal Man</em>, artist Travel Foreman evokes this dislocation by creating a world of open, realistic but flattened spaces with bizarre, hyper-detailed intruders. (Steve Pugh largely takes over by issue #7, but maintains Foreman&#8217;s overall stylistic deisgn.) Buddy Baker and his family are pursued by a grotesque, distended group calling themselves The Hunters Three who can consume living beings and wear their skins. The Hunters are portrayed as occasionally struggling to fit within their assumed shapes, which become cartoonishly distorted when a hunter is distracted or fatigued. Nothing about the process is pleasant or pretty. &#8220;This will hurt very badly,&#8221; one of the hunters tells a victim as he is being eaten, &#8220;but I need your sssskin. . .&#8221;</p>

<p>The flatness of Buddy Baker&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; world is a vivid illustration of the new series&#8217; central revelation. While Baker has been empowered by the Red as the <em>de facto</em> champion of the animal world, he is only a placeholder. The untimely death of the Red&#8217;s previous avatar left them in need of a temporary replacement, so they granted some of the next avatar&#8217;s abilities to her father. Maxine Baker&#8217;s connection to the Red far exceeds anything Buddy Baker has ever experienced, and her nacent powers already far exceed his own. Maxine is also just four years old, and for all her power, far from able to protect herself from the Lovecraftian figures pursing her.</p>
<p>While Buddy Baker finds himself a smaller figure in a bigger world, a custodian more than a champion, then Alec Holland is precisely the opposite, the champion who was taken from the Green and has now returned. Holland, however, wants nothing to do with the destiny the Green so fervently desires that he embrace, and he finds himself trying to prune back the tendrils the Parliament of Trees have wrapped around his soul. Fittingly, Yanick Paquette&#8217;s art is lush, flowing, and sometimes oppressively detailed. In the second and third issues, Holland meets a kindred spirit in Abigail Arcane, a woman whose family has a deep connection to the Rot, and who has a history with the Alec Holland simulacrum that was the previous Swamp Thing. Holland finds himself irresistibly drawn to Abigail, defending her life against both the Rot seeking to reclaim her, and the Green&#8217;s demands that he destroy her. </p>

<p>In different hands, we might have had two strong but unrelated titles, the interim hero and the reluctant champion with their very different stories in their own separate worlds. Linking the two together is a brilliant idea which has been executed with what I&#8217;m certain was no little effort and a great deal of skill. The star-crossed lovers and the father defending his progeny are both classic, even primal stories, but together they form a rich and unexpected epic about blood and family, and creating a future beyond what is encoded within history and genetics.</p>
<p>Because of this, <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em> are comics about heroism and not just superheroes. Both titles have seen, groundbreaking work in the past (as written by Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, respectively), but they existed for all practical purposes in their own pocket narrative universes. With their New 52 incarnations, Snyder and Lemire have been able to bring themes (and a level of quality) more often found in indie comics or imprints like Vertigo to the mainstream DC universe. It&#8217;s an effort whose first fruits are just beginning to mature, but the ground is rich, and there&#8217;s the promise of even better to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a little kid, probably about six or seven years old, I had this recurring nightmare: A tall thin man would float outside my second floor bedroom window. He was always dressed in a black business suit, and had a gaunt profile with thinning white hair. I could never quite make out his features through the slats of the window blinds. Bright golden sunlight would stream into my room from behind him, rendering me completely immobile as he watched. And he would just laugh and laugh and laugh.</p>
<p>Even typing those words today give me chills like you wouldn’t believe.</p>
<p>There’s something so utterly creepy about the simplest imagery that just roots into a little kid’s mind and soul. Never once in my dreams did this bogey man try to grab me or even pass through my window. He had no bloody hand, clown mask or giant scythe with which to threaten me. There was a stare and laughter. His <em>presence</em> was enough to startle me awake, and that sort of palpable atmosphere of fear is difficult to translate into words, much less pictures.</p>
<p>Difficult, but clearly not impossible. Horror comics are nothing new, stretching back in popularity to post-World War II America. Genuine terrors seen abroad made way for tales to titillate young readers, with gruesome fates being meted out every month. Where a bulk of comics (or movies, or books, or video games) since may have fallen short is in overemphasizing the literal. We’ve all read stories where the monstrous form of a child’s nightmare takes physical shape, splashing blood and brain matter across the page as if it were errant paint on a canvas. Gore may rile the senses, but the subtlety of a bogey man that looks like everyone else, who passes through life unnoticed except to his victims, generates a far more permanent effect. When only YOU can see or feel the horror that is coming to get you &#8212; and the panic starts to wiggle almost unnoticeably beneath the skin of your arms and belly &#8212; that’s when true fear starts to set in.</p>
<p>No one knows this better than Scott Snyder. Co-writing with Scott Tuft, Snyder delivers <em>Severed</em>, a prime example of just how terrifying the bogey man can be &#8212; especially if he looks just like every one else. Published in 2011 by Image Comics, this seven issue series flashes back on the story of 12 year-old Jack, who has run away from home in 1916 to find his long-lost father. Eager to find a sense of his own identity out on the road, Jack quickly falls in with a traveling companion named Sam, as well as an older mentor figure who just happened to eat the last boy he retrieved from an Illinois orphanage. Adopting the name Alan Fisher from the man he just killed for it, Snyder and Tuft’s bogeyman casually comes upon the pair in the park as Jack plays his violin for coins. He looks every bit like a man two kids without a roof over their heads could trust. So when &#8220;Alan&#8221; offers the pair food and a few beers back at his place, Jack agrees without hesitation.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10451" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/30/bogey-men/severed1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg" data-orig-size="640,485" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Severed1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=640&#038;h=485" alt="Severed" title="Severed1" width="640" height="485" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10451" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/severed1.jpeg?w=300&amp;h=227 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Having just left the secure comfort of his adopted home, Jack is not prepared for the horrors that have been awaiting him out in the cold. That said, Alan is at his most terrifying when his hand is comforting and his appearance remains thoroughly banal. Attila Futaki’s illustrative style draws a brilliant balance between the everyday and uncanny as he moves the camera’s eye from panel to panel. Much of the true horror of Alan’s threat is ever unseen, only alluded to in a plate of chicken bones, or reserved for large single page reveals. Moment to moment, Futaki maintains the characters’ bearings with calm line and subdued environments &#8212; as if to render a certain artificial calmness about their interactions.</p>
<p>As a result, we witness Alan’s demeanor to be so compellingly trustworthy to Jack that even bringing out an enormous bear-trap to the dining room table seems no more suspicious than any other party game. And to some degree, we momentarily trust as well. Certainly Jack is desperate for a father figure, so it’s understandable that he would simultaneously be drawn to a man who could fill that role and assist him in locating his actual father. But the further along this road Jack travels, the more we’re left hanging on the edge of our seats in anticipation for an inevitable, terrifying reveal. We know the teeth have been removed, but what lies beyond them is where the truly frightful awaits.</p>
<p>Similarly, Snyder also introduces an exceptionally chilling bogey man in the form of James Gordon Jr. in the collected tale <em>Batman: The Black Mirror</em>. Completing original publication from DC Comics’ monthly Detective Comics in 2011 as well, <em>Black Mirror</em> centers on the return of the long lost son of perennial Batman associate Commissioner Gordon. Far from a happy reunion, James Jr. is met with hesitation and dread, for his reemergence from the shadows outside Gotham City means investigations of the past are reopened &#8212; suspicions of his true culpability behind a childhood disappearance still weigh heavily on his family.</p>

<p>Even more than in the obscured bogey man of <em>Severed</em>, Snyder develops an antagonist in James Jr. that leaves the reader guessing at every turn. We are no more sure than the Commissioner of his son’s guilt as the story evolves. Having been considered odd from the youngest age &#8212; seemingly devoid of emotion even as an infant &#8212; James Jr. appears to epitomize the profile for Batman’s more traditional, psychologically challenging foes. Yet his calm demeanor and easily explained activities make for a much more ambiguous villain. James Jr. is Gotham’s usual psychopathic terror turned inside out, an internalized horror well contained in contrast with the usual externalized embodiment of chaos and misery. Likewise, James Jr. is also an inversion of the standard bogey man mythology in that he is originally a child who is feared by adults, not the other way around. When a friend of Barbara Gordon (the Commissioner’s more famous and heroic progeny) goes missing after calling young James Jr. “creepy,” Barbara’s suspicions immediately go towards her brother, but their father remains torn even fifteen years later. This is the power of the bogey man, not only to terrorize, but to convince the world at the very same time he doesn’t actually exist.</p>

<p>Sharing artistic duties in this volume with the remarkable talent Jock, Francesco Francavilla illustrates most of the story Snyder lays out for James Jr., from his arrival on video at the Gotham aviary to his ultimate confrontation with his much less conflicted sister. At times Francavilla depicts James Jr. as a hovering monster, whose opaque red glasses imply deeply disturbing thoughts ready to manifest themselves with the flick of a wrist. For most of the narrative, however, the artist maintains the same terrible sense of banality we see in <em>Severed</em>, but in flattened day-glo tones that scream danger without having to depict it literally. So little of Gotham is ever seen in daylight, but even at night, James Jr. remains more thoroughly darkened than would otherwise &#8212; his own shadow even extending over the faces of his more illuminated family members as they interact or discuss his condition.</p>
<p>Scott Snyder and his collaborators have managed to craft on paper that indescribable unease we often can only experience in dreams, or if terribly unlucky, in real life. It’s been over 30 years since I dreamed of that floating man outside my bedroom window. While I may still shiver recalling the vision, I’m pretty confident those nightmares won’t be returning to involuntarily taunt my adult brain. Whether there will soon be another bogey man lined up to replace him? Of that, I am now less sure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My recreational research of animals and overactive imagination means I often entertain the idea of the possibility of movie monsters being real things.  For me this is my normal thought process and I don’t understand why everyone else isn’t more scared of this shit.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGQNztpOnDw">Glow-in-the-dark cat clones are part of our world</a>, what’s so off-the-wall about thinking movie monsters could really happen?  Also, sometimes nature doesn’t need a whole lot of embellishment to be terrifying.   The abominations of the silver screen and their existence in the natural world can be easily linked with a little crazy creativity, and I’ve made a LIST.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alien</em> &amp; the Giant Isopod</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7326" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/969104893_0c5c546408/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg" data-orig-size="375,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="969104893_0c5c546408" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=225" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=375" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7326" title="969104893_0c5c546408" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=225&#038;h=300" alt="giant isopod" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300 225w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg?w=113&amp;h=150 113w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/969104893_0c5c546408.jpg 375w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
<p>The giant isopod is like an aquatic woodlouse (roly poly) only, you know, bigger.  They can survive for eight weeks without food, but when these carnivorous scavengers scuttle over an abundant food source they’ll consume until they’re immobile</p>
<p>They don’t seem like much of a threat based on their fairly normal crustacean lifestyle, but I wouldn’t fall for that, “If your giant isopod is bigger than your face you have cancer” bullshit and put the crustacean up to your head. That’s what it WANTS you to do so it can gorge on your insides.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arachnophobia</em> &amp; the Cyclocosmia Spider</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7331" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/spider-cut/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg" data-orig-size="500,362" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="spider cut" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=500" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7331" title="spider cut" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=300&#038;h=217" alt="cyclocosmia spider" width="300" height="217" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=300&amp;h=217 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg?w=150&amp;h=109 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/spider-cut.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Seeing <em>Arachnophobia</em> as a child mainly scared me on account of how hard it was to kill the spider at the end.  That damn thing was the Rasputin of arachnids.  But stomp on something hard enough and it will stop living, right?</p>
<p>Probably not the Cyclocosmia spider.</p>
<p>It looks like it has a boot print on its ass from getting stomped on and NOT DYING. Science explains the weird truncated abdomen is its protection.  The hardened disc serving as a plug for the spiders borrow to keep unwanted visitors out and a means of camouflage.</p>
<p>Shut up, science! Spider voodoo surely keeps it alive!</p>
<p><strong><em>The Blob</em> &amp; the Sea Pig</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7334" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/sea-pig-4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg" data-orig-size="550,412" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sea-pig-4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=550" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7334" title="sea-pig-4" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" alt="Sea pig" width="300" height="224" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=224 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=112 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/sea-pig-4.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Even Steve McQueen ran his bad ass away from <em>The Blob</em>, the gelatinous amorphous creature that fell from the sky.  To find nature’s blob hopeful look not up, but down.</p>
<p>The sea pig lives at great depths on the ominously named abyssal plain in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans.  Kinda cute as members of the sea cucumber family go, but like many kinds of sea cucumber, sea pigs are often found in huge numbers.  A gigantic mass of pink squishy things, you say?  Like. . . a BLOB?</p>
<p>It’s still too early to tell the extent of the damage from the BP oil spill.  It could some-crazy-how cause sea pigs to fuse together to form a carnivorous pink glob.  An angry glob.</p>
<p><strong><em>Evil Dead 2</em> &amp; the Chinese Water Deer</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="7345" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/10/13/natural-monsters/chinese-deer/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chinese-deer" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=400" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7345" title="chinese-deer" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Chinese water deer" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/chinese-deer.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><em>Evil Dead 2</em>, while gloriously campy, does genuinely frighten me a bit.  Aside from the stab of panic I feel over the threat of ankle-grabbing cellar dwellers, there’s this possessed deer head. I used to live in far less fear with the knowledge that creepy deer with pointy teeth are not a thing, but then. . .</p>
<p>Instead of antlers Chinese water deer have what are technically classified as tusks, or, in murderous murdering terms, FANGS. Fangs the deer can actually MOVE. They can be drawn back out of the way while eating, or thrust forward to use in combat.  Like you do if you’re an evil deer.</p>
<p>In fact, according to Wikipedia, “Recently, the &#8216;vampire deer have made headlines in Southern Tennessee because &#8216;Aimee,&#8217; a small female, had escaped from a Marietta, Mississipp farm and displayed aggressive behavior towards visitors on the Natchez Trace Parkway.”</p>
<p>Wait. Tennessee?  Where <em>Evil Dead</em> was filmed?  Oh, HELL.</p>

<p>If you’ve never seen this science fiction (ahem) * thriller * about <a title="Night of the lepus" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xulXFB3-A3c">carnivorous mutated rabbits</a> then you have wasted less of your life than I.  I thought the concept giant rabbits was a load of bullocks. And then I discovered these gigantic bunnies.</p>
<p>My first thought was literally, “OH, SHIT.  GIANT RABBITS.”  For though <em>Night of the Lepus</em> is ridiculous, the idea of a rabbit ripping your throat out is actually terrifying because, let’s face it, bunnies are supposed to be non-threatening.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcxKIJTb3Hg">Monty Python really knew what they were talking about</a>. The Flemish Giant Rabbits were bred large on purpose based on the notion that large rabbits equals lots more rabbit meat.  If <em>Jurassic Park</em> has taught us anything, it’s that if man manipulates nature, nature is bound to rip man’s throat open with it’s adorably oversized teeth.</p>

<p>Pokemon are weird bastard animals trained to battle other weird bastard animals with their magic to become more powerful, or whatever. It’s a little scary if you think about it (battles aren’t to the death, because, you know, the children.  But if it weren’t for the children you know these things would be slaughtering the shit out of each other).</p>
<p>I realize a Pokemon Lightning Dragon isn’t a movie monster, but, seriously, look at this sea slug and tell me your first thought wasn’t, “It looks like a Pokemon!”</p>
<p>The Nudibranchs thrive and reach their largest sizes in warm, shallow waters (where most humans like to swim).  If those waters were ever contaminated with whatever nuclear waste cocktail made Godzilla, well, you can see we&#8217;d have a problem.</p>
<p>Having shed their shells at the larval stage, Nudibrachs developed other means of defense.  Some types of Nudibranch prey on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Man_O%27_War">Portuguese Man O’ War</a>, which is slightly terrifying on its own.  Nudibranchs don’t kill the Man O’ War, they just eat off its most potent nematocysts (stinging cells) and rather than digest them, the slug passes them from its gut to the surface of its skin to use for protection.  Explain it with as much science as you want, it seems like gaining experience points and leveling up to me.  It’s just a matter of time before a slew of Nudibranchs mutates and start collecting us all.</p>
<p><strong><em>Zombies! </em>&amp; The Greenland shark</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Greenland Shark" src="https://i1.wp.com/2009oceans5.wikispaces.com/file/view/greenlandShark.jpg/114501201/greenlandShark.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="259" /></p>
<p>My first thought when I look at this shark?  Zombie.</p>
<p>If there were to be zombie fish, or a fish responsible for a zombie outbreak the Greenland shark would be the cause of it.  It lives in very deep, very cold water and it moves very slowly, much like the undead. Its lifespan is speculated to be 200 years (it’s 200 years old because it’s a damned ZOMBIE).  The perfectly logical explanation for the undead look of the eyes is a parasite called a Copepod that burrows into the shark’s cornea.</p>
<p>I don’t care what’s causing it.  It looks FUCKING. CREEPY.</p>
<p>Also, Greenland shark meat, considered a delicacy in Greenland and Iceland, is straight up toxic.  To prepare it you have to boil the hell out of it or bury it in the ground and let it freeze and thaw several times in order to ferment it.  Without this preparation consuming fresh, untreated Greenland shark meat may cause effects similar to “extreme drunkenness.”</p>
<p>You know what else resembles extreme drunkenness?</p>
<p>THE WALKING DEAD.</p>
<p>I’m not completely convinced that Greenland sharks are NOT Great White zombies.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d say you were within your rights to bite<br />
The right one and say, &#8220;what kept you so long?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What kept you so long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Morrissey &#8220;Let the Right One Slip In&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">I must admit right off the bat (pun only partially intended) that I am not a big fan of vampire films, generally speaking. At least not in the way that I am a zombie film fan, the way that allows me to watch even the most horrendous tripe, rife with predictability, poor FX and lazy, painful dialog without hesitation or regret. There is something inherently frightening to me about zombies, the loss of humanity, and the sheer volume of them, along with a certain level of childhood attachment to that fear. Their very presence can rekindle it. Since I have neither a childhood attachment nor fear of vampires I require much more from a vampire film than the mere presence of the creature.</p>
<div style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Nosferatu, 1922" src="https://thebestpictureproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/nosferatu.jpg?w=199&#038;h=283" alt="" width="199" height="283" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The first vampire film? Not hardly. The most influential? Now that&#039;s debatable.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">The vampire film has been around since the early 1900s, but many point to F.W. Murnau’s silent classic,<em> Nosferatu</em> (1922), based on the novel <em>Dracula</em> by Bram Stoker, as the birth of the subgenre as it is known today. Universal Pictures and Hammer followed suit, each putting their own spin on the tale of young Jonathan Harker, who, after an ill-fated meeting with the Count involving real estate (spooky), loses his love to the vampire&#8217;s kiss. Originally those films were brimming with dark, gothic mood. Ominous castles backlit by a full moon, a wolf howling in the distance and more fog than a <em>Cinderella</em> concert (Yeah, I went there).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the 70s vampire films began to focus more on the creature’s undertone of sexuality (Most films made in the 70s tended to focus on sex, actually). The vampire&#8217;s bite became (more) erotic, his concubines became more obvious tools of seduction and, well, <em>Vampyros Lesbos</em> (1970) and <em>The Vampire’s Night Orgy </em>(1973) got released. All of this is well and good for a teenage boy (or girl) looking for some cheap thrills, but were these films actually good?</p>
<div style="width: 311px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" " title="The Lost Boys" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.filmschoolrejects.com/images/thelostboys.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="243" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You&#039;ve got something on your chin</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">The 80s saw the rise a more fun, tongue-in-cheek vampire film that actually works a bit better for me than the soft-core skinimax of the 70s. <em>The Lost Boys</em> (1987), <em>Vamp</em> (1986), and <em>Fright Night</em> (1985) are all good fun, some playing off the themes of their predecessors and some forging a path soon to be mimicked (1996’s <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> owes a fair amount to <em>Vamp</em>, both in setting and tone). Tobe Hooper’s <em>Lifeforce</em> (1985) put a nice spin on things, replacing Transylvania with outer space and blood with energy, and <em>Near Dark</em> (1987) (brought to you by future Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow) was a slick-looking vampire western. Still, vampires are vampires, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the 90s <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> (1996) featured vamps via Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino (‘nuff said) and <em>Bordello of Blood</em> (1996), <em>Tales from the Crypt</em>&#8216;s second foray into feature films, brought us a wise crackin’ Dennis Miller as a vampire hunter and a wise crackin’ Corey Feldman as a vampire, crackin’ wise (‘nuff said, again). <em>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</em> (1992), <em>Blade</em> (1998), and <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> (1994) all made a decent dent in the box office and, in the straight-to-video market, we were blessed with a little Alyssa Milano nudity (A lot, actually) in <em>Embrace of the Vampire</em> (1994). But these films were mostly style (and nudity) over substance.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Then in the late 2000s a film finally did what <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415348/">Vampiyaz</a> </em>in the early 2000s could not: start a vampire revival. That film, unfortunately, was <em>Twilight</em> (2008). But amidst the brooding, sparkling and inanity of the Edward versus Jacob debate the first vampire film I can, without hesitation, add to my list of favorite films was released. That film was <em>Let the Right One In</em> (2008).</p>
<div style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="Let the right one in" src="https://i2.wp.com/passionforcinema.com/wp-content/uploads/Let-The-Right-One-In-19-42.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="255" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A budding romance</p></div>
<p>The film concerns a boy named Oscar who is largely ignored by his mother and relentlessly bullied at school. One day a little girl and her “father” move into the apartment next to his. The first time the two of them speak Oscar is repeatedly thrusting a knife into a tree in his complex’s courtyard. She asks him what he’s doing then tells him that she cannot be his friend.</p>
<p>These meetings continue and they do become friends. Oscar learns that her name is Eli and that she likes puzzles. He also notices that she is consistently shoe-less, despite the frigid weather. <em>We</em> learn that there is a reason I put quotation marks around the word “father,” as Eli’s seems to spend his free time killing people and collecting their blood. Anyone who has seen a vampire film knows what’s up, but what makes <em>Let the Right One In</em> so impressive is its handling of these normally clichéd concepts. We even get to see what happens when Eli enters someone’s home without an invitation. It’s not pretty.</p>
<p>At heart of the film is the budding relationship between Oscar and Eli and how it helps Oscar find his confidence. The fact that Eli is a vampire is almost secondary or, at least, not terribly important until the second act when Oscar must make a decision. The weight of that decision is made all the more heavy when we realize that the nature of Eli’s relationship with her “father” is perhaps not so different.</p>
<div style="width: 314px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Let me in" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.fearnet.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010627/LetMeIn_site.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="228" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A budding romance, American style</p></div>
<p>In 2010 an American remake called <em>Let Me In</em> was released (the original is Norwegian). It was directed by Matt Reeves who had previously brought us the shaky cam monster movie <em>Cloverfield</em> (2008), a far cry from the slowly paced, elegantly filmed <em>Let the Right One In</em>. There was cause for concern, but the remake turned out to be a near duplicate of the original, sometimes shot for shot.</p>
<p><em>Let the Right One In</em> transcends its genre by using a vampire as a means to tell the story rather than making the vampire the story in and of itself. It is about adolescence and first love. It is about addiction. It is also a great tragedy. Sometimes it&#8217;s fun to see some over-the-top, cheeky vampire action, but if you&#8217;re looking for a truly <em>great</em> vampire film you&#8217;d do well to let this one in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year I lament the state of the Halloween horror movie marathon.  Sure, networks try (A <em>Friday the 13<sup>th </sup></em>here, a <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em> there), but it almost always feels like an obligation and not the indulgence it should be.  What’s Halloween without a proper horror marathon?  Thankfully, this year I didn’t have to ask.</p>
<div style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="The Brain Eaters" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/brain_eaters.jpg?w=320&#038;h=249" alt="" width="320" height="249" /><p class="wp-caption-text">How many people have even HEARD of this one? </p></div>
<p>AMC and TCM have saved my Halloween.  Not simply by airing horror marathons, no, but by airing phenomenal horror marathons.  AMC’s &#8220;Fearfest,&#8221; which runs from October 18<sup>th</sup> to the 31<sup>st</sup>, started off like every other year.  <em>Friday the 13<sup>th</sup> </em>parts one and two?  Imagine that!  Even the cable guide description seemed disinterested: “Killer stalks another group of teens.” But then… day two.  <em>Night of the Living Dead (1968), The Brain Eaters (1958) </em>&amp; <em><a href="http://http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/10/the-cinephiles-september-10/" target="_self">The Funhouse</a> (1981)</em>!  Say word?!  Anyone who has been paying any attention knows <a href="http://http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/01/fall-of-the-living-dead/" target="_self">how close <em>Night</em> is to my heart</a>.  And <em>The Brain Eaters</em>?  What a fantastic left-field choice!  It even features a brief appearance by a young Leonard Nimoy, whose name is misspelled as Nemoy in the credits.</p>
<p>Day three:  <em>Day the World Ended (1955) </em>&amp;<em> They (2002)!</em> Say word-er?!  Could it be?  Are we working on a legit, no joke horror movie marathon? <em> Day</em> is a great Roger Corman B-Movie about a scientist battling a mutant after an atomic war destroys most of humanity, and <em>They</em> features one of the most chilling endings I can recall.  I won’t bore you with the <a href="http://http://www.amctv.com/fearfest/movies-by-date/" target="_self">entire schedule</a>, but suffice it to say, it’s top notch and it all culminates in the premiere of the new, Frank Darabont produced zombie television series <em>The Walking Dead</em>.  Can-not-wait.</p>
<div style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="The Unknown" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.moderntimes.com/palace/20_image/unknown.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="216" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Unknown (1927) Forplay ain&#039;t easy when you can only use your feet. Or is it easier?</p></div>
<p>On top of that delicious Halloween sundae sits a nice little cherry in the form of TCM’s late night horror programming.  Every Friday they are running Hammer Horror films like <em>Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed! (1969)</em> and <em>The Horror of Dracula (1958),</em> which are always fun, as well as a dearth of silent horror classics like <em>Freaks (1931)</em> and <em>The Unknown (1927). </em>It’s great to see <em>The Unknown</em> in particular as it is, well, relatively unknown.  It features a super creepy, armless Lon Chaney Sr. murdering a man using only his feet!  So, there’s that.</p>
<p>And now I am a figurative zombie at work because I have been up so late watching literal ones.  I have no regrets and I have all of November to sleep.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of year where we relish in the television programming of numerous month-long horror moviethons. It’s also that time of year when children’s fears are formed by inadvertently catching a glimpse of daddy’s favorite slasher flick. We’ve all been scarred by witnessing something we shouldn’t in movies and television at a young age. It shapes us. It’s the basis for our fear of commitment… public speaking… clowns.</p>
<p>Being a child of the eighties I inevitably share in the list of unavoidable traumatic experiences: the entirety of the <em>Thriller</em> music video, Large Marge from <em>Pee Wee’s Big Adventure</em>, the creepy-ass ferry ride in <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> (it’s the worm! it’s the chickenhead!) Despite the across-the-board scares, every kid has been traumatized by a number of unique moments in film that have shaped who they’ve become. These, my friends, are candidly mine:</p>
<p><strong>#10. The Sentinel (1977)</strong></p>
<p>In this bizarrely entertaining supernatural horror flick, a young model finds a new apartment in New York City. Little does she know it not only houses her, but the gateway to Hell. This film is filled with a plethora of truly strange moments, but the scene that firmly left a terrifying impression finds the woman awoken in the middle of the night by strange sounds in her apartment. As she investigates an empty room, a demonic figure materializes behind a door and power walks across the room without acknowledging her. That alone gave me horrific paranoia that something would materialize at the foot of my bed and walk out of the room. I’m just happy I didn’t see the remainder of the scene as a child where she stabs the corpse repeatedly and chops off its nose – blech!</p>

<p><strong>#09. Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988)</strong></p>
<p>“What’re ya gonna do, knock my block off?”</p>
<p>The famous last words of the street tough that breaks the little Klown’s bike have seared their way into my childhood memories. Shown on as a Saturday afternoon flick on some random local channel, my cousin and I found the concept of wacky Killer Klowns irresistible. However, when this scene showed I quickly lost my bravery and spent the rest of the movie staring at the back of a couch pillow. It’s all fun and games until someone loses a head.</p>

<p><strong>#08. Dr. Giggles (1992)</strong></p>
<p>As children, sleepovers often tend to manifest as odd games of chicken. Your friend has scored a copy of some R-rated film you aren’t supposed to see, and it becomes a game to see who freaks out first. For me, it was <em>Dr. Giggles</em>, and I lost. Big time. As a woman struggles for life, she calls for a doctor. Dr. Giggles arrives on the scene to inspect the problem… The poor woman is already in an immense amount of pain when the doctor pulls out an instrument to peek up her nose: a spike that stabs through to her brain. I can’t quite say the extent that this scene had on me, despite its cheesiness, but It’s still been over a decade since my last check-up.</p>

<p><strong>#07. The Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)</strong></p>
<p>This film is the epitome of what children shouldn’t see. The opening scene is scary enough&mdash;Dan Aykroyd scared the hell out of me as a kid (he still does, but now it’s for more creepy-old-man-holding-onto-the-past reasons), but that’s far from what kept me (and subsequently my parents) up for night after night. Joe Dante’s segment involving a kid who can manipulate his surroundings to suit his every whim seemed fun enough… but it’s the reveal of his sister who is forced to endlessly watch cartoons that ripped my stomach to shreds. Those strained eyes! That mouthless face!!! I’ve never been the same. Even <em>The Matrix</em> brought back terrified feelings.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvUJBcuLl6U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#06.  Hellraiser (1988)</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting scare for me as it’s not even a scene from the film, but one single image of a man without skin lounging around an apartment. I haven’t seen this film, but I caught this horrific image while staying the night in a family friend’s house for the first time. The unfamiliar setting mixed with such unnatural and gross imagery made for an utterly unpleasant night. If memory serves me right, I forced my parents to leave in the middle of the night and get a hotel. But then, I was only six, so I doubt I had that sort of power over my parents.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Hellraiser" src="https://i0.wp.com/paperweb.me/images/uploads/288.jpeg" alt="" width="666" height="373" /></p>
<p><strong>#05. The Wizard of Oz (1939)</strong></p>
<p>I think from birth until around five years old this was my favorite movie. But then as my fragile little brain developed &#8220;comprehension&#8221; and I began to understand the concepts of &#8220;intention&#8221; and &#8220;consequences.&#8221; The Wicked Witch sending her evil monkeys to attack Dorothy and her friends was enough to send me into fits of rage as a child. Specifically the shot of the Scarecrow getting torn apart was too much for my delicate little mind. To this day I refuse to watch <em>Johnny Got His Gun</em>, and I blame it on the thought of the Scarecrow’s torso crawling around.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SESI19h4wDo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#04. Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988)</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure what traumatized me more, seeing Christopher Lloyd’s terrifying transformation at the end of this film or finding out that the insane maniac Judge Doom was also Doc Brown! This was a double whammy for me. After his psychotic outbreak at the end of <em>Roger Rabbit</em>, (particularly the unbearable squealing as he was run over by a steamroller,) I wasn’t able to watch <em>Back to the Future</em> for years. The sight of Doc Brown scared me as at any second I expected red devil cartoon eyes to appear. And don’t even get me started on <em>Angels in the Outfield</em>.</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADrojCw6amM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#03. The Exorcist (1973)</strong></p>
<p>I realize that this is rather a cliché choice, but after seeing <em>The Exorcist</em>, I was unable to even close my eyes for fear that I would see that demonic face&mdash;not the grotesque make-up effects on poor Reagan, but the chilling ghostly face that appears throughout the film. I saw this film at <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">eighteen-years-old</span> too young an age to deal with the idea of a demon consuming my mind and body. I had to fall asleep to <em><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Three’s Company</span></em> Looney Tunes for at least a week afterwards.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone" title="The Exorcist/Captain Howdy" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/captain_howdy.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/captain_howdy.jpg?w=300"></a>#02. Fire in the Sky (1993)</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time on a lovely Saturday afternoon HBO changed my life forever. Unaware that a twelve-year-old <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">boy</span> baby might be watching the film, they decided to program <em>Fire in the Sky</em>. The twelve-minute abduction sequence is by far one of the most traumatizing scenes I’ve ever endured. The fear of those Don Rickles lookin’ aliens has never left me. Searching for the following clip was torture, even at nearly thirty-years-old:</p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrQLqFfelic?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><strong>#01. Robocop (1987)</strong></p>
<p>While <em>Fire in the Sky</em> is certainly the strongest and most lingering traumatizing film from my childhood, the number one spot goes to the earliest memory I have that set the stage for all fears of film to come. First let me say, this is no film for a child to watch&mdash;it makes me nauseous even today. In a way I was lucky that the only part I witnessed was this scene near the beginning of the film where the evil ED-209 prototype is being demonstrated for a number of investors. “I’m sure it’s only a glitch,” he says… the sheer lack of humanity and the amount of gore those bullets produce was entirely and completely mortifying.  I blame this film for my later fear of war movies. It wasn’t the Nazis that made me afraid of <em>Schindler’s List</em>, it was Robocop!<em> </em></p>
<iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrXfh4hENKs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p>So there it is. The late eighties were a rough time for me, but every fear helped shape who I am. For the most part I’ve gone back and conquered most of these films. These days there aren’t many films that linger with me, but I always enjoy the few that do. I don’t mind losing a little sleep if it reminds me that I’m still alive! Hopefully none of you use this revealing information to torture me in the future&mdash;but at least I didn’t reveal my fear of <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Harpo_Marx.jpg">Harpo Marx</a>. Shit!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Halloween is perfect for video games. In a sense, nearly everyone who turns on a video game is putting on a costume to run around as Mario, Master Chief, or a lovingly-crafted <em>World of Warcraft</em> avatar for just a little while.</p>

That's pretty scary.</p></div> There’s also some scary, scary shit out there. The original <em>Metroid</em> is scary. Fighting hordes of the undead in <em>Resident Evil 4</em> or <em>Left 4 Dead</em> is terrifying. Games like <em>Manhunt</em> or 2005’s <em>The Punisher</em> are just fucked up. (Hillary Clinton complaining about <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>? She didn’t have a clue.) </p>
<p>Some of the scariest (and fondest) video game memories I have, however, involve watching my roommate play <em>Silent Hill 2</em> in the basement of our apartment. Part of this is because <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is a well-constructed, genuinely frightening cinematic game. One of its master strokes is the figure of Pyramid Head, an unpredictable, lumbering Freudian metaphor who slaughters people in front of your eyes, and is, within the game, absolutely invincible. Even at the end, when he acts as the second-to-last boss fight, the player character never has the ability to damage Pyramid Head. All you can do is run, hide, and wait for him to finally destroy himself.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1433" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1433" data-attachment-id="1433" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/10/28/1410/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x.jpg" data-orig-size="468,285" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Silent Hill 2 &#8211; Pyramid Head Shot-468x" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x.jpg?w=468" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x.jpg?w=300&#038;h=182" alt="Pyramid Head" title="Silent Hill 2 - Pyramid Head Shot-468x" width="300" height="182" class="size-medium wp-image-1433" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x.jpg?w=300&amp;h=182 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x.jpg?w=150&amp;h=91 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/silent-hill-2-pyramid-head-shot-468x.jpg 468w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1433" class="wp-caption-text">Hiding from Pyramid Head</p></div> This powerlessness &#8212; where running is more important than shooting &#8211; is what separates the survival horror genre from first-person shooters, where a player may face overwhelming odds, but those odds have more to do with the sheer mass of cannon fodder than with a sense that the enemies that one faces are somehow beyond the capabilities (or even the understanding) of the player character. Sure, the Big Daddies in <em>BioShock</em> are tough, but you kill five of them during the course of the game. You never kill Pyramid Head. </p>
<p>In <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the question of what Pyramid Head means becomes far more important than figuring out how he can be damaged. </p>
<p>It has to be admitted that the final explanations that survival horror games provide are usually pretty disappointing, but it’s the in-game execution of the encounter with the ineffable that make the experience so frightening, so mind-bending, and so much fun. Pyramid Head is a god, in the old pagan sense of the word. The ending is almost beside the point. </p>

In <em>Resident Evil</em>, there are explanations, and worse, they are, as Tom Bissell memorably notes in his essay &#8220;Headshots,&#8221; rather stupid. The zombies are the result of a virus, developed by the evil Umbrella Corporation. Why? Because Umbrella is evil. Why are they evil? Because they&#8217;re a corporation. As the series progresses, however, it&#8217;s increasingly clear that there&#8217;s nothing behind the Umbrella Corporation. There&#8217;s no <em>there</em> there. Umbrella is a rather lazy invocation of faceless greed, which, as far as I know, isn&#8217;t really what makes zombies scary.</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is famously built on a Freudian psycho-sexual foundation where the player character&#8217;s guilt constructs and drives the purgatory he is forced to explore. To the game&#8217;s credit, however, Pyramid Head exceeds his role as a walking phallus. He&#8217;s not just Freudian, he&#8217;s Jungian. More than that, he&#8217;s something out of Lovecraft &#8212; something that finally cannot be comprehended, or even spoken. This is what horror is &#8212; the encounter with that which precedes description. It gets distilled into zombies, plagues, and vampires, but the difference between fear and horror is the difference between being killed and being eaten. </p>
<p>In all honesty, another part of the fondness of my memories comes from the fact that I was watching and not playing the game. I’m a bit of a chicken &#8212; I still can’t watch <em>Alien</em> &#8212; and the slight insulation that came from watching someone else play instead of playing myself meant that I experienced a game that I probably otherwise would have avoided. </p>
<p>I have toughened up a bit over the years, which is good, because I don’t have a roommate anymore. Now I have to run from Pyramid Head myself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two things you can count on in life: Death and Taxes. I say add Remakes to the list. Remakes certainly aren’t a new trend. Alfred Hitchcock even remade one of his own films. The problem is that remakes have ceased to be an innovative take on an old story but instead have become a quick “cash-grab.” Producers figure they can take an established franchise and that brand name alone can carry them to success. Over the last 5 or 6 years, horror films have become a gold mine for producers to pillage and plunder. There really isn’t one classic horror film from the last 30 years or so that hasn’t been remade (except for <em>The Exorcist</em>). For the most part, horror films are cheap to make. They don’t require big name talent in front of the camera and usually cost so little they can turn a profit with one lucrative opening weekend. Not all remakes are terrible, a few have improved on the original, but for the most part they’re lazy and really just prove that there wasn’t much of an idea there to begin with. </p>
<p>Two remakes that improved on their source material came out well before the remake train left the station. John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing</em> (1982) and David Cronenberg’s <em>The Fly</em> (1986) are less remakes as they are re-imaginings. They take the original&#8217;s themes and ideas and twist and craft them into something completely unique. These are not only great remakes, these are both horror classics. If you haven’t seen either of them, check them out immediately. In 1990, George Romero wrote and produced a remake of his own <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> which certainly isn’t in the same league as its predecessor but stands as a competent, fun remake.</p>
<p>The current remake trend really got off the ground with <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2003). Produced by Michael Bay, Chainsaw looks great and it cut together into one hell of a trailer but the glitz and gloss of the production takes away from the gritty, documentary feel of the 1973 original. It’s a great example of a film’s bigger budget working against it. Bay’s company, Platinum Dunes, is a factory of remakes. Save for one original film, they’ve remade <em>The Amityville Horror</em> (2005), <em>The Hitcher</em> (2007), <em>Friday the 13th</em> (2009), and <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (2010) to mostly dismal results. Not a single one of these remakes has anything to add to the story. <em>The Hitcher</em>, for example, is almost a shot-for-shot recreation of the little-seen 1986 original. This year’s <em>Elm Street</em> remake managed to take the ingenious casting of Jackie Earl Haley as Freddy Kruger and turn him into a bland, uninteresting villain. The best of their remakes is perhaps <em>Friday</em>, since the originals weren’t all that great to begin with. That one, like the others, does nothing to up the ante.</p>

If you don’t know of any of these films beyond their remakes or didn’t know they were remakes at all, please seek out the originals. With the exception of <em>Prom Night</em> (1980), a rather silly slasher, these are all classics in their own right and every single one of them puts the remake to shame. <em>Black Christmas</em> (1974) in particular is a criminally under-seen slasher that <em>Halloween</em> (1978) owes a lot to. Speaking of <em>Halloween</em>, Rob Zombie’s <em>Halloween</em> (2007) is perhaps my most hated of all the recent horror remakes. Here is a film that is so woefully out of touch with what made the original film so good: The mood, the suspense, and the subtlety. Zombie’s film is an exercise in Blunt Force Trauma filmmaking that succeeds only in completely stripping the mystique from Michael Myers. Everything is over the top. There’s a case to be make that Zombie did a re-imagining and did his own thing here; trying to eclipse a classic is hard to do. I’d agree that Zombie’s take on <em>Halloween</em> is his and his alone, it just. . . sucks. There’s really no other way to put it. Unsurprisingly, I have yet to tackle Zombie’s <em>Halloween II</em> (2009).</p>

Let’s get this out of the way: The original is a masterpiece and one of my all-time favorites. I was pre-disposed to hate this movie but Zack Snyder is such a visually compelling filmmaker and it feels so outside of what the original was doing, that it’s hard not to get swept up here. Add to that some great special FX, a snappy script, and a cool cast and the new <em>Dawn</em> is one of the best horror movies of the last few years.</p>

A true re-imagining in every sense of the word, <em>Hills</em> has enough of the familiar beats of the original and then amps everything up. Like <em>Dawn</em>, this remake has a skilled filmmaker, great cast, great FX, and music. The mutants are vile and when they get their comeuppance, we are right there cheering for their demise. I like the 1977 original, but the 2006 version stands with <em>The Thing</em> and <em>The Fly</em> as a remake that improves upon its source material. Feel free to skip the 2007 sequel.</p>
<p>Perhaps twenty or thirty years down the road these films will be remade once again. Most likely, we’ll see the break-out horror successes of this decade remade as well. With the supposed “Final Chapter” hitting theaters next week, it’s only a matter of time before the inevitable <em>Saw</em> remake. And if you’re saying to yourself, “Hey, <em>Hellraiser</em> hasn’t been remade yet”, never fear. A director was just announced for the remake today. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" title="the crazies" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.pitaara.in/wp-content/uploads/The-Crazies-2010.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="307" /></p>
<p>I am far removed from George Romero&#8217;s original <em>The Crazies</em>, having only viewed it once and with little interest. It wasn&#8217;t specifically that it was too talky (it most certainly was). It was that it was too shouty, if that is a word (it most certainly isn&#8217;t). Must <em>everyone</em> shout about <em>everything</em>?! But I digress&#8230;</p>
<p>Breck Eisner&#8217;s fine remake features better acting and far less shouting. Not that there isn&#8217;t plenty of cause for shouting given that something is making the residents of Ogden Marsh, Iowa go insane at an alarming rate. What might that something be? Somebody dropped something into something? Someone accidentally flipped a switch on the something or other? Somebody ate a radioactive sandwich? It is pretty inconsequential, actually. There are zombies. Well, not exactly zombies, but let&#8217;s not split hairs.</p>
<p>The story is pretty clearly defined by its three-act structure. The first act involves the town&#8217;s deterioration, the second an attempt to contain the virus, and third its post-apocalyptic aftermath. It is not entirely successful at any of these three scenarios, but much of that has to do with its 101 minute running time and not its execution.</p>
<p>There are several, highly effective set pieces here. For example, there is a chilling scene where the town doctor, played by Radha Mitchell, is strapped to a gurney surrounded by several others suffering from various stages of the virus. One of them giggles relentlessly as another of the crazies slowly shambles amongst them with an already bloodied pitchfork. You can infer he is not looking to bale hay. Another is one of the scariest car wash scene I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It is funny to see a film that is so completely conventional in its approach and entertaining despite that. Bottom line: If you have seen one zombie movie, you have seen them all. This one happens to be pretty good even though there are no zombies in it. Hair-splitter.</p>
