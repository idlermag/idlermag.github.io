										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about clothes lately. I mean, I think about clothes constantly &#8212; I love fashion &#8212; but recently I’ve been aching for a new look, the right look. This happens every once in awhile. Years go by and I begin to notice that the wardrobe in my closet doesn’t match me anymore. In one way or another, it doesn’t fit. Like a sloughing of the skin, a regeneration, I begin to itch in the once-perfect sweater. I notice the bruised, tired soles on the once-favorite shoes. </p>
<p>My various looks have been governed by many a whim and many a hope. In 8th grade, I bought every piece of clothing that was covered with sunflowers, so that a field of the cheery hippie-90s flower hung in a long hangered row. By sophomore and junior year of high school, I’d eliminated all that mustard yellow for crisp A-line skirts and dresses, platform patent leather maryjanes and any cheap modern knock-off of Mary Tyler Moore’s style (Mr. Grant and Rhoda era Moore, not Dick Van Dyke). For the briefest moment I sought all things Tommy Hillfiger and Polo. Carefully collecting classic striped sweaters, khakis, and clean-lined brown leather ankle boots, I tried to sell myself as serious (and more monied) chic, but though others wore the brands so crisply, to me it felt like the most boring disguise. My retro theme soon returned in the form of polyester short-sleeve button downs in loud patterns and colors, and supa dupa fly white shell toe Adidas. </p>
<p>In college, I played twee baby “punk,” dumpy hoodie schlump, and thrift store art girl. The latter felt the most authentic even as I carried the giant patent leather bag of someone’s dead grandmother and rocked the pale blue trousers of the slim matching gramps. </p>
<p>Sometimes I dressed up hoping I’d find the person I was looking for waiting in the neon purple mohair, or filling the pink suede triple-velcro-strap sneakers. Maybe I’d find her in the thickest smudge of eyeliner. Maybe I’d glimpse her in the mirror wearing fishnets and pointy stilettos. </p>
<p>Other times I dressed for my mood or my body. Recurring depressions are archived in dark baggy clothing. The year I went “sporty” in oversized baseball t-shirts, loose jeans, and hip running shoes, my sartorial choices quietly covered over the tear-stained junk food binges. </p>
<p>The cobalt blue and white H&amp;M wrap dress tessellated with geometric shapes bespoke confidence, comfort, the beginnings of self-acceptance. Paired with 4.5 inch chocolate wedge sandals, I walked healthily, happily, to teach my first stand-alone classes.</p>
<p>One grey and gnarled college hoodie marked a year of loneliness, a sadness I couldn’t fathom, a fatness that somehow seemed less shameful or (maybe, hopefully) invisible under this cloak. It couldn’t really be so, but I remember the texture of this piece as fuzzy, furry, but rough like a Brillo pad. It said, “don’t touch me, don’t see me, I’m not really here.”</p>
<p>A thin-mint green wool sweater, three-quarter-sleeved with a jaunty shoulder-baring collar. So 50’s sweater girl, yet I wore it while presenting a paper at my first academic conference. </p>
<p>The fright/glee when my skinniest pair of jeans shimmied down of their own volition, past jutting hip bones, into a sloppy sag. To take them off at the end of the day, no need to unbutton, no need to unzip. </p>
<p>Sometimes you just hold on to these things too long, not the memories, but the things themselves plus the memories of what they meant. That’s where I’ve been recently. Holding on to those garments that made me feel strong and proud. The clothes that made me feel the most me. . . until they didn’t any longer. I waited, season after season. Fall and Spring catalogues cycled, recycled. And still they hung ghostly before my bed. I wondered, “When will I be the person who can wear those clothes again? When will I be her/me again?”</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I participated in yet another ritual cleansing, stuffed all those relics away into white garbage bags destined for Goodwill. And again I’ve started building, picking, buying, collecting. Starting again with a simple but bright orange mod-style dress, short sleeved, artfully loose, but clingy and friendly to the curves. And piece by piece I begin looking for myself again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We tend to think of style icons as people with a little age on them &#8212; people who, seasoned with experience, can turn out any look for any occasion. However, it’s important to remember that the young’uns are often the daring vanguard from which high fashion takes its cues. Messy, playful, devil-may-care, kids use fashion to emote and shape themselves and they do so with drastic shifts in style/identity. That’s why someone like Tavi stands out as so interesting. Not only does she make fashion her own in a perfectly youthful and experimental manner, but she also has made herself incredibly known for cultivating a well-defined, artistically composed, and refreshing sense of personal style. She’s got all the edge of youth and the consistent confidence and quirky elegance (quirkegance?) of someone 3 times her age.</p>
<p>Hailing from the suburbs of Chicago, Tavi Gevinson started her blog <a href="http://www.thestylerookie.com/" target="_blank">Style Rookie</a> at age 11. In it she shares her runway obsessions, day-to-day outfits, look inspirations, and t(w)eenage thoughts. Her smart sartorial compositions and creative personality immediately shone through to her followers and before long the “fashion world” (like all those serious Mugatu-type folk) were knocking down the door of this teeny tastemaker. Soon, Gevinson was living a fashion fantasy as all the hippest designers started gifting her amazing pieces she could work into her collection of vintage finds and her expertly mismatched wardrobe. </p>
<p>Riding her fame and accolades, Tavi’s expanded her pop culture footprint by starting <a href="http://rookiemag.com/" target="_blank"><em>Rookiemag</em></a>, an online magazine and interactive forum for (young) women. The site reminds us that Tavi isn’t necessarily a wunderkind, rather, all young people have meaningful perspectives, thoughts, art, and ideas to share. She and her editors use the site to start conversations about topics relevant to girls ranging anywhere from bullying, first-time sex, and best friend relationships, to room decoration, and discussion of favorite books and movies. Not too shabby for a high schooler who likes art and clothes and stuff.</p>
<p>If Tavi inspires you like she does me, there are few ways you can start adopting her look into your repertoire. For one, you’ll have to be a lot more flexible with all the “rules” of proper dressing. You might take an afternoon or 5 and play in your closet &#8212; try to remember when dressing up was a game and look with new eyes. That dress could be a skirt if you popped a sweater on top, and oh, the dress’ collar would peek out ever so sweetly. Practice mixing shapes and textures that we’ve categorized into separate genres. How would 90s-era Courtney Love wear a fancy black tulle skirt? Maybe with a washed out half-shirt? Combine seemingly opposing aesthetics to each other &#8212; 70s Mary Tyler Moore, meet nerdy grandma style.  Feeling a sparkle princess vibe? How could you tone down the Disneyness of baby blue shine? Maybe with some serious yet chic combat boots. Ultimately, you gotta use your noggin to imagine fashion fusion and do so without taking yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>Tavi is above all a master of theme and pattern. Look at the collections of postcards and photos on her blog and you can see she’s great at finding artistic themes and details everywhere she looks. She might fall in love with a movie character or wallpaper design or album cover and she then translates the look and feel of that specific imagery into her clothing. Open your eyes. Look around you. Take cues from prints, art, and designs you admire. Don’t be afraid to thrift, clash, or be eclectic. It’s boring to look exactly like a GAP ad, so find your weirdness and wear it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born into a major Hollywood family, a lot of Sofia Coppola’s career has been critiqued as a product of nepotism. After all, it can’t be too hard to break into the movie biz when Francis Ford Coppola is your daddy.  I’m not one of her haters though. Beyond her elegant and heart-wrenching screenwriting, her directorial portrayals of femininity as both fragile and fierce, I’m pulled to this Coppola’s strength of aesthetics. There’s just something about Sofia. </p>
<p>Movies like <em>Lost in Translation</em> (2003), <em>The Virgin Suicides</em> (1999), and <em>Marie Antionette</em> (2006) possess a mesmerizing visual power as Coppola creates moods with meticulous settings, washes of color, and scenes framed to capture both the agony and the ecstasy of any given moment.  I love how she is invested in the bittersweet and how she uses style to express the affective register of her films.  </p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that her personal style is likewise consistent, nuanced, and impeccable. Coppola’s closet is marked by a heavy rotation of classy basics. She doesn’t dip into every trend, though you will see her don an artsy piece of modern construction or fresh cut for formal events. In general, her look is cool, chic, laid-back, easy, but definitely put-together. Her take on feminine is simple with a few soft flourishes like a 70’s style tie-neck blouse, or a sweet yet polished Peter Pan collar. When capturing her look, aim for well fitted pants that skim curves, but not too tightly. Dark-wash bootcut or slightly flared trouser jeans maintain a balance between casual comfort and strong lines that can take you just about anywhere. Though you’ll see her in simple or artsy pumps, the ease of her look is best expressed with classic flats. Think minimal fuss, but with a bit of interest &#8212; a metallic bow detail or some other clean, modern extra, but nothing too heavily patterned or garrish. Coppola acheives her just-threw-this-on appeal with garments that aren’t overtly sexy, or girly. Fit for her is loose, but not sloppy and a structured bag and well-cut coat temper the flowy lines of the rest of her outfit. </p>
<p>When taking a cue from Sofia, less is more. Find comfortable pieces that aren’t overtly feminine, but are soft and easy. Focus on fit and play up unexpected palettes and details. This style icon is not about blaring statements, but thoughtful assemblages that create a feel, an air, a subtle and tasteful impression.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrie Brownstein is rock and roll fun</p>
<p>Riot Grrl, band member of Sleater Kinney and Wild Flag, Carrie Brownstein is most recently famous for her work as a laugh-riot-girl on the ever quirky and strange IFC comedy series, <em>Portlandia</em>. Though this feminist chica is hot and awesome for both her talents and rockin’ ways, I’m also totally crushing on girlfriend’s wardrobe. Carrie Brownstein, you are a style icon!</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10571" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/19/style-icons-carrie-brownstein/carriewildflag/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg" data-orig-size="399,595" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="carriewildflag" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=201" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=399" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=201&#038;h=300" alt="onstage" title="carriewildflag" width="201" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10571" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=201&amp;h=300 201w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/carriewildflag.jpeg 399w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px" /> Carrie’s style is basic, but hip. It’s relaxed and simple while quietly purring “rrrrrrawk.” There’s a tomboyish aspect to her uniform as she tends to live in jeans and shorts, but the cut and fit are everything. Her pants are always perfectly snug giving her a sleek sexy vibe even as she doesn’t show much skin. Her shorts, though they show off her great legs, often give off a cheeky appeal as she pairs them with tucked in, button-down shirts. These clean tailored outfits present a punked-up boy scout vibe and remind one a little of another musical school boy, AC/DC’s Angus Young. Brownstein’s shirts are either crisp, oxford style tops with short or rolled sleeves, or femme floaty blouses, perhaps with a little sheen or sheerness. When she sports the latter and throws on a sweet pair of speckled tights on under those shorties, the outfit becomes a magical amalgam of retro flirtatiousness and modern bad-assery. Now, granted, some of this comes with context. She’s up on stage, rollicking, strumming her guitar and singing her lungs out all while writhing to the music, flicking her head back and punctuating her performance with a high kick or two; this behavior paired with the sugary diaphanous tops is fashion balance to T. She soaks those dolly blouses in rocker sweat, shreds those tights like she does her guitar. Oh, and her rough and tumble, short-stack-heeled leather ankle booties &#8212; yeah, they’re, again, just the right mix of tough and cute. Work it out, head to toe, CB.  </p>
<p>Now, to make Brownstein’s style our own, as we are but mortals and not rock goddesses, we must up the ante a little in the accessory department. Grab all the basics, some grey, eggplant, or even lilac colored tight skinnies and your well-fitted buttoned and/or artsy-Portland-gal tops, but then add some studded earrings or a tough black leather cuff for more masculine umph. Miu Miu-inspired glitter boots are all the rage this season; find your knock-off pair and let your kicks bespeak your rock and roll lifestyle. Keep the look simple for ultimate chicness. Maybe let a structured, full coverage, pretty bra show through under your see-through shirt, but do remember to always temper the sex-pot of it all. Keep the hair messy bedhead in style and the makeup minimal &#8212; a swath of red on the pout if you feel like causing a ruckus. The Carrie look is cool and unassuming with a strut that’s willing and waiting to show itself. Put on some Wild Flag. Shake out your waves. Find your strut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stuck in a style rut? Look to the small screen for inspiration. Add some drama to your life and prime your wardrobe for any situation a comedic storyline could throw at you. </p>
<p><strong>1. <em>Scooby-Doo</em></strong></p>
<p>Our gal Velma was doing color blocking before it was a thing. Show off that curvy bod in shades of red and orange while you solve cases and fend off fiends. These two looks are sweet, hip, and of course incredibly nerdy. Odds are Daphne will be jealous when you hop into the Mystery Machine in these threads. Jinkies!</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9704" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/09/style-tips-from-the-tube/velma/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png" data-orig-size="718,583" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Velma" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png?w=640&#038;h=519" alt="Velma style" title="Velma" width="640" height="519" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9704" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png?w=640&amp;h=519 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png?w=150&amp;h=122 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png?w=300&amp;h=244 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/velma.png 718w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>2. <em>Louie</em></strong></p>
<p>Feeling a little darker? A bit more depressed? Got a bit of an ice cream gut that could be covered up some (so you can go eat more ice cream)? Take a cue from the F/X network’s favorite misanthrope, Louie, and hoodie up. This uniform includes a lot of comfortable cotton and in case you can’t tell, in Louie-land black is the new black. . . stupid. Look simply okay while you grumble or pick up a doughnut. Fancy fashion is for people who care.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9705" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/09/style-tips-from-the-tube/louie/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png" data-orig-size="721,558" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Louie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png?w=640&#038;h=495" alt="Louie style" title="Louie" width="640" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9705" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png?w=640&amp;h=495 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png?w=150&amp;h=116 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png?w=300&amp;h=232 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/louie.png 721w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>3. <em>Three’s Company</em></strong></p>
<p>True, not everyone’s a Louie. Some of us prefer to grab a few beers down at the Regal Beagle with our quirky roommate, stroll by the beach in a racer-back tank, or enjoy a juicy gossip session with Mrs. Roper. Rock some tight shorties and bubble gum pastels like the lovely Chrissy and for sure clomp around in some super high-heeled wedges. Careful not to trip though &#8212; save the pratfalls for Jack.</p>

<p><strong>4. <em>The Golden Girls</em></strong></p>
<p>Now, say Blanche Devereaux invites you to her favorite watering hole, The Rusty Anchor, for a night of picking up sexy available men. Well, you’re gonna need something spangly like a sequined top. Sequins = Sexy. Some blush-pink jeans will make Rose Nylund smile and minty green flat sandals will show Dorothy that you’re both fashion savvy and sensible. Add a signature Sophia wicker clutch and you’re golden.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9707" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/09/style-tips-from-the-tube/golden_girls/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png" data-orig-size="714,593" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Golden_Girls" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png?w=640&#038;h=531" alt="Golden Girls style" title="Golden_Girls" width="640" height="531" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9707" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png?w=640&amp;h=531 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png?w=150&amp;h=125 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png?w=300&amp;h=249 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/golden_girls.png 714w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>5. <em>Dexter</em></strong></p>
<p>Dexter and the Golden Girls all live in Miami, but they might as well live in completely different worlds. If you’re looking for an outfit that better suits your serial killer vigilantism, you can’t go wrong channeling Dex with intense pops of blood red. Don’t-mess-with-me Louboutins that double as weapons are a must and don’t forget the gloves; you wouldn’t want to leave a fingerprint behind. Horizontal stripes on your trench connote your prison of secrecy, if not foreshadowing actual incarceration. A brown henley is a Dexter kill-suit basic and with a little red lipstick you’ll be looking fresh to death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Indelicato is most known for his role on ABC’s <em>Ugly Betty</em> as Justin Suarez, Betty’s sharp-witted and kind-hearted nephew. But the young actor and singer has recently begun trying his hand at fashion journalism and photography, and has grown into quite a style inspiration. Today, I have the pleasure of chatting with Mark about his exciting new fashion blog, his future plans, and the next step in his life: college. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Early this year you did a &#8220;Fashion Week Diary&#8221; for </em>Teen Vogue Magazine<em> and started your own style and photography blog, <a href="http://www.thefashiongangster.typepad.com/" target="_blank">The Fashion Gangster</a>. Who or what inspires you fashion and photography-wise? Can you name some of your favorite photographers and designers?</em></p>
<p>I find the entire fashion industry intriguing. <a href="http://www.thefashiongangster.typepad.com/" target="_blank">The Fashion Gangster</a> was just a spur of the moment idea that I had, and I&#8217;m so happy it has really taken off! A lot of my inspiration for <em>Fashion Gangster</em> shoots comes from Terry Richardson. The clean white background really lets viewers focus more on the model and the garments they&#8217;re wearing. My very favorite designers are Rick Owens and Alexander Wang. There are so many more, but it would take forever to tell you all of them! </p>
<p><em>Your photos have a bit of a 1970s flair and a crisp but edgy street style, which I love. What kind of camera do you use? Do you do your own lighting for the shoots?</em></p>

I am so inspired by the 1970&#8217;s and David Bowie, so I&#8217;m glad you can see that. I use a Nikon D5000. I do my own lighting for every shoot but it&#8217;s not highly produced at all! I just went to Home Depot and bought a giant construction light and that&#8217;s all I use!</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s coming up next for </em>The Fashion Gangster<em>? It looks like you have a great circle of model friends who mesh well with your style.</em></p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;s next for <em>The Fashion Gangster</em>? I really enjoy the blog and will continue to do what I am already doing with it! My models are my best friends, so it&#8217;s always wonderful shooting them.</p>
<p><em>You’ve been a working actor for almost half your life. How old were you when you started training at The Actor&#8217;s Center in Philadelphia?</em></p>
<p>I really have always been interested in performing. I was 6 when I started training at The Actor&#8217;s Center.</p>
<p><em>You were twelve when </em>Ugly Betty<em> began and sixteen when the series ended. What was it like growing up on the set? Growing up in the public eye?</em></p>
<p>Growing up on set was so amazing. I got to grow up around such amazing, driven people and I truly believe it was being around those people constantly that shaped me into the person I am today. The public eye is not always the greatest. Being criticized constantly when you&#8217;re in your early teens is not the best for one&#8217;s self esteem. But, it&#8217;s something that you have to take with a grain of salt and move past, and that&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p><em>You just had a reunion with the </em>Ugly Betty<em> cast this month. Were you excited to see your former cast members again?</em></p>
<p>Of course! Since the show ended we have all been on different coasts, so getting together again was so great.</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;re applying to colleges right now. What do you intend to study? Any plans to return to acting after (or during) college?</em></p>
<p>I plan to study either fashion or journalism. I would love to dabble in the fashion industry and see what happens with that. I plan to act, but college and little more self discovery need to come first! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Doan is a one-woman powerhouse who is equal parts kind, fun, unpretentious and driven. I first met her online in 2004, and it’s been wonderful to watch her go from her hot independent clothing line, Shrinkle, to her new runaway brainchild, Sugarpill Cosmetics. Sugarpill is a custom line of richly-pigmented eyeshadows in paint-bright, show-stopping colors, inspired by theatrical makeup and underground drag queen makeup, but with a velvety formula for daily, long-lasting wear. Sugarpill was concocted and created entirely by Doan, who was new to the cosmetics industry but wanted to create something different than what was already available on the market. By taking the best qualities of theater, luxury and club makeup, she combined them to make something totally new. After 5 years in the making, Sugarpill launched in February of 2010, and today we have the pleasure of talking with Amy about her cosmetics line, and what the past year and a half has yielded for Sugarpill.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>It’s been eighteen months since the launch of Sugarpill, and you’ve been featured in </em>Auxiliary<em>,</em> Papercut<em>,</em> Harlow<em>,</em> Faint<em>,</em> Gothic Beauty<em>,</em> Whore!<em> and </em>Creepy Queen<em> magazines. How has the response to Sugarpill compared to the expectations you had when you first came up with the idea in 2005?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6940" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/09/07/sugarpill-an-interview-with-amy-doan/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo.jpg" data-orig-size="349,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sugarpill-packaging-and-logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo.jpg?w=349" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo.jpg?w=300&#038;h=257" alt="sugarpill packaging and logo" title="sugarpill-packaging-and-logo" width="300" height="257" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6940" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo.jpg?w=300&amp;h=257 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo.jpg?w=150&amp;h=129 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-packaging-and-logo.jpg 349w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> In 2005, I thought it’d be fun to have my own makeup line as a side hobby to mess with when I needed a break from sewing. I honestly did not expect Sugarpill to grow so quickly and consume my life to the point that my sewing would have to take a backseat. I’m definitely not complaining! Just surprised and thrilled that people responded so well to Sugarpill that my life took an unexpected turn.</p>
<p><em>You have a degree in journalism and a background in fashion design from your eBay / Etsy monster, Shrinkle. With your Shrinkle clothing designs already going strong, what turned your attention to starting your own cosmetics line?</em></p>
<p>I loved styling photo shoots for my clothing line with the most obnoxious hair and makeup I could find. For years I used theater and clown makeup to create the dramatic effects I was looking for. I wondered why there wasn’t a makeup line that offered the ridiculous and bright colors I loved, in super professional quality and ultra cute packaging. I felt like something needed to be done to make high quality, insanely pigmented cosmetics more accessible to people who don’t frequent clown stores and drag queen bars.  </p>
<p><em>You independently researched, contracted and hand-picked everyone involved with the production of Sugarpill cosmetics, building the brand from the ground up. What’s it been like having such direct involvement with every step of the manufacturing and design, as opposed to stamping your name on a product that was corporate-owned or designed by other people?</em></p>
<p>I adore the creative process that goes into creating a unique product. My brain is always cluttered with a billion ideas, but there simply aren’t enough hours in a day to bring them all to life. By starting a fresh new brand, I hoped to put as much of my creative vision out there as possible and offer something new and exciting that wasn’t already available. </p>
<p>When I began to promote Sugarpill months before its launch, I was met with a bit of skepticism from people who wondered if Sugarpill would just be the same old shit as every other new makeup brand who repackages pre-made cosmetics and slaps their logo sticker on the lid. I felt like I had a lot to prove because of the horrible reputation that others had given the indie makeup scene. Customers are a lot smarter than these brands gave them credit for, and I had to work twice as hard to prove that I wasn’t going to let them down. I was incredibly antsy and couldn’t wait for everyone to have the product in their hands so they could see for themselves how awesome and one-of-a-kind it is. And they were definitely not disappointed, yay!</p>
<p><em>Were there challenges you faced in navigating new territory like the cosmetics industry?</em></p>
<p>Luckily, I was a licensed online retailer of Kryolan cosmetics for several years before I started Sugarpill. So it was a pretty comfortable transition because I had spent years learning what people like and dislike, and what they wished for in cosmetics.</p>
<p><em>The Sugarpill collection currently consists of 27 loose and pressed eyeshadows. Any plans to add any other types of cosmetics to the brand in the future?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6943" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/09/07/sugarpill-an-interview-with-amy-doan/sugarpill-cosmetics-display/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-cosmetics-display.jpg" data-orig-size="471,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="sugarpill-cosmetics-display" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-cosmetics-display.jpg?w=283" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-cosmetics-display.jpg?w=471" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-cosmetics-display.jpg?w=282&#038;h=300" alt="sugarpill display" title="sugarpill-cosmetics-display" width="282" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6943" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-cosmetics-display.jpg?w=282&amp;h=300 282w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-cosmetics-display.jpg?w=141&amp;h=150 141w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/sugarpill-cosmetics-display.jpg 471w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px" /> 1,000% definitely! The details are top secret though, sorry! I’m not superstitious at all, but I still hate talking about projects until they are ready for launch because I’m afraid to jinx it. All I can say is that we’re working on so much new stuff right now that I feel like my brain is going to explode!</p>
<p><em>Last year, Sugarpill caught the attention of Island Def Jam recording artist Kerli, who chose the makeup as the official brand for her “Army of Love” video. Did the Sugarpill contests in conjunction with Kerli bring a new audience Sugarpill?</em></p>
<p>That was nuts! I was a big fan of Kerli for years and admit I was a little intimidated at first by her extreme hotness. Turns out she is the sweetest, most down-to-earth person ever and was very eager to join forces with Sugarpill. We are awesome friends now, and she brings so many creative ideas to the table. She has the best style ever, so you can imagine how honored we are to be her official makeup brand!</p>
<p><em>Sugarpill was the official makeup brand for</em> Sanrio’s Hello Kitty 35th Anniversary Celebration <em>in 2010, and I know you also designed a dress for the fashion show, as well as a new dress for the Hello Kitty mascot! What was it like combining your fashion expertise with your new makeup line at the event?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6945" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/09/07/sugarpill-an-interview-with-amy-doan/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan.jpg" data-orig-size="450,673" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan.jpg?w=201" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan.jpg?w=450" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="Amy Doan Hello Kitty" title="hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6945" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan.jpg?w=200&amp;h=300 200w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan.jpg?w=400&amp;h=598 400w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hello-kitty-mascot-dress-by-doan.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150 100w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /> Everything was sprung on me in small doses, so it all sounded very manageable at the time. First they asked me to design a dress for the fashion show, and I said, “Of course!” All my friends were going to be in the show too, so it sounded like a fun time. Then they asked if Sugarpill would be the official makeup brand for the event, and with slightly less confidence I answered, “Suuuuure!” We hadn’t even launched yet, but I figured I could skip a few nights of sleep and wing some shit. Then just days before the fashion show, they asked, “Oh yeah, and do you want to re-design Hello Kitty’s mascot dress?” That’s when I had my major “HOLY SHIT” moment, but I gulped and responded with an enthusiastic yes even though I was secretly dying on the inside. It was too awesome of an opportunity to turn down. I was absolutely delirious from weeks’ worth of sleep deprivation on the big night, but it was so worth it. Everything went amazingly beyond my wildest dreams. I was so happy that I cried at the end of the fashion show. No lie, my friends took pictures of me sobbing like a big baby in the middle of a party. I felt like such a proud mama! </p>
<p><em>Aw, that’s so sweet! Any plans to return to fashion design anytime soon?</em></p>
<p>I would love to, more than anything! I feel sad that I haven’t had time to design or sew since launching Sugarpill. Every week I say, “For real this time, no one bother me this weekend because I’m gonna bust out my sewing machine and make some really cool stuff!” Then the weekend comes and I mysteriously find myself working another Sugarpill event or project. It’s not that I ever wanted to abandon designing clothes in favor of working on the makeup line. But Sugarpill is growing so quickly that I have to do whatever I can to keep up. We are new, so I’m still learning how to balance and manage my time. My ultimate goal is to successfully run both businesses simultaneously.</p>
<p><em>Sugarpill is a unique product that meets a previously unanswered demand for bold, colorful, artistic makeup for daily wear. But what’s most inspiring to me about Sugarpill’s story is that it was a dream and creation realized by one person as an independent company. Any advice to entrepreneurs like yourself who are making their way in an uphill independent business or creative endeavor?</em></p>
<p>If you love what you do and are extremely passionate about what you create, then you’re on the right track. A lot of people go where they think there is money to be made, but screw what your parents said about following the money and being “stable!” The happiest people I know are the ones who know are extremely passionate about their hobbies, take risks, and don’t care how many hours a day they have to work or how many years they have to live on Cup O’ Noodles in order to turn their hobby into a fulfilling career and lifestyle. If you can’t imagine yourself doing something for 12 hours a day and being happy, then go find something else before your soul starts to rot!</p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>As a performer I&#8217;m known for my dark, out of the box acts—messy, outrageous, sometimes borderline offensive. I do have my moments of pretty, feminine acts, but on the whole I think I&#8217;m more known for pushing boundaries, and if I happen to come across as sexy while doing it, so much the better. My modeling tends to contain that same aesthetic, and I would say my sarcastic, black-humor-tinged outlook on life as well.</p>
<p>I have been seen in short films for Nokia, been featured on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, have danced with Natalie Portman in <em>Black Swan</em>, posed nude for foreign magazine fashion spreads, worn priceless designer couture with Q Models in fashion videos, walked the runway for impeccable gothic designers, shot fetish films in Newcastle, graced the stages of legendary NYC nightclubs, and so much more! It&#8217;s been a wild ride!  </p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m always thinking up new acts for my regular burlesque residency with Original Cyn Burlesque at the Lucky 13 Saloon in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I&#8217;m also looking forward to getting my foot in the door with new shows and venues &#8212; right now I&#8217;m excited to be performing with Geek Girl Productions again, for Edification for the first time, and of course with my favorite underground NYC party <em>TRASH!</em> at Webster Hall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been doing a lot of television and film work recently. I just did featured background work on a new show for HBO called <em>Spring/Fall</em> starring Tea Leoni and Sigourney Weaver. You will also be able to catch me on upcoming episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order: CI</em>, <em>How To Make It In America</em>, <em>Men In Black 3</em> and many more to come.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a dancer and performer?</em></p>
<p>I grew up dancing. My mother had been a ballerina and when I was old enough to walk, she decided it was time for me to start ballet lessons. I continued with ballet until well into college, when I took a break to focus on my BFA in Media Arts/Animation at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. A few years after moving to New York I started modeling, and a DJ gave me my first real “start” as a burlesque performer at the infamous <em>Rated X: The Panty Party</em> at Luke &amp; Leroy’s. I didn&#8217;t really know that I was doing &#8220;burlesque&#8221; per se &#8212; I had choreographed a dance number and incorporated some strip elements into it. After that I started gogo dancing at various downtown parties for fun, and then in 2008 I was approached by the amazing Fem Appeal who runs <em>Kitty Nights Burlesque</em> every Sunday at Bar on A. She asked me to debut at her show, and from there the ball started rolling. I was very lucky in the sense that people have been willing to give me a shot sight-unseen, or by word of mouth. That&#8217;s not always easy to do in this town!</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>“Go big or go home.”<br />
“A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.”<br />
“If not now, when?”</p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I moved to New York as a theatrical performer in 2010, having done shows such as <em>bare</em>, <em>The Wild Party</em>, <em>A Few Good Men</em>, <em>Side Show</em>, <em>La Cage aux Folles</em>, and more. I&#8217;ve also done drag for almost four years now, and have always had a passion for makeup &#8212; I even went to school in full face every day of my sophomore year in high school in conservative Cave Creek, Arizona. I&#8217;m 6’5” and both of my parents were models, so I got pushed into that as soon as I was old enough. I&#8217;m known for my strange personality, and for being kind while being dressed like a bitch.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>Right now I’m working on a few parties that I will be starting, and I&#8217;ve been altering and making a lot of my clothes. I have some offers for shows (theatre) lately that I&#8217;m juggling and can&#8217;t really talk about yet. I&#8217;m looking to start working on music more since that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m the most versed in, and I&#8217;m pulling a lot of inspiration from my significant other.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a performer and model?</em></p>
<p>I became everything that I am, and that I do, because it gives you a key to open minds and challenge people&#8217;s thoughts and beliefs. I like to make people question themselves because if we all plateau intellectually, we might as well be dead. Individuality is not only attainable by some, you just need to tell society to piss off and live life for yourself.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in hate, and I believe that “regret is like drinking a glass of poison and waiting for someone else to die.” I believe that if you want something you should go for it. And I believe that if you need to put down others to get to where you want to be, and if you keep hidden agendas and secrets, you don&#8217;t deserve to achieve your dreams. Live, love, and keep your chin up.</p>

<p><em>Nadia Aboulhosn’s self-styled photos have been featured on fashion blogs and sites all around the web, including teenvogue.com. Says Nadia:</em></p>
<p>I am known for pushing limits and breaking barriers. I am known for doing what I want despite society&#8217;s views and beliefs.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em> </p>
<p>My creative energy is focused on my fashion blog and my future career in fashion. I am constantly in competition with myself to outdo what I previously did before. I am currently in the process of building a portfolio to apply for fashion school in New York. I am looking to start my own shoe line, style people other than myself, and possibly start modeling. All in all, my desire is to eventually become a fashion icon and inspire people everywhere. I just got done with a photo-shoot for <em>Seventeen Magazine</em> that will be out in November 2011. They used me to model some of their clothes. </p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue fashion?</em></p>
<p>Designing and styling always came easy to me. Fashion is the only thing that excites me, so making it my career is only right. Through art, people are able to express themselves whether it&#8217;s  drawing, painting, or music. Fashion, to me, is another form of art. It is a way for me to express myself. </p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em> </p>
<p>Never compromise. Settling is never an option. Dictate your own life while thinking intelligently rather than emotionally. </p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I am known for bending the gender lines in a way no one has done before. My extreme ways of expressing myself are quite delicious to some. Some call me the &#8220;Master of Masquerade&#8221;, and I like that. I&#8217;ve been on the cover of <em>Quest Magazine</em> (Wisconsin&#8217;s LGBT Mag) and just recently took an artistic risk in my newest short movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqEwQCCA6Q0" target="_blank">&#8220;Angel&#8217;s Ashes,&#8221;</a> which was just released on YouTube. But most of my success has come from the internet, winning photo contests and such&#8230; so far&#8230;</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I aspire to take over the world. To act, to move people. Continue with photography and creating photos that twist people&#8217;s minds into endless questions. I aspire to be on the cover of national magazines and to help people find the courage to run with fire, come into their own and be truly comfortable with who they are.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a model, performer and artist?</em></p>
<p>I always felt like I wanted to make the world a better place. I was always the weird, awkward one that everyone was leery about. I scratched the walls of my small town until my nails bled. Now I&#8217;m exploring every possible facet of life and entertainment, and I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>Eat the brains of life! [laughs] Or:<br />
&#8220;Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well.&#8221; &#8211;Josh Billings<br />
&#8220;Be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love, work, play and to look up at the stars.&#8221; &#8211;Henry Van Dyke</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, when I’m not Facebook Tetrising my odd minutes away, I love to create fashion sets on Polyvore.com.  The site provides a place for you to browse clothing, accessories, beauty items, home goods and various other doo-dads you might (wish to) purchase.  If you’ve got the cash-money, you can use the site to locate things and then actually buy them, or if you’re like me, you can just imagine fantasy wonderlands in which you are not in grad school and your closet is full of Marc Jacobs, Kate Spade and Nanette Lepore goodies.  “But Ana, I can imagine that marshmallow fashion fluff in my brain without a silly website,” you say.  Well, yes, I suppose you could.  But with Polyvore you can also stretch your creative muscles and create cute little editorials—visual collections you can share with your friends (and people who have money and know that your birthday is coming up soon).  I make these fashion sets all the time and I have quite the fan following (of people who were already my friends and similarly enjoy fashion), so today I’m going to share some tips with you so you, too, can get Polyvoracious with your free time.  </p>
<ol>

<li>Play.  Once you’re signed in, click on the “Create” button to start building your page.  If you’re a newbie, just click on everything and see what happens to get the lay of the land.  If you feel like you’re completely artless, the easiest thing to do is to select the “Template” option and it will provide a host of various pre-formed pages for you.  These serve as super easy to use blueprints in which you can just drop your fashion items.  It’s basically paint-by-numbers and you’ll always have a visually appealing, if not unique to you, creation.</li>

I tend to either begin with A.  a theme (Summer in Italy!, My Date with Beck, A Tribute to Frida Kahlo) or B. a search (nude pumps, A-line mini skirt, heart-shaped-sunglasses, etc.)
<p>Option A:<br />
With a theme, you have a more rounded out sense of what could fill your page.  For example, an office what-to-wear-to-work theme almost suggests your searches for you.  Let’s see, I’ll need closed toe pumps (not too high), a suit, new glasses. . . .  An oddball theme like “A Day at the Circus!” might get you to push yourself a bit more.  How can circus life inspire you to playfully build an outfit that you would actually enjoy wearing?  Maybe suspenders and a flower pin are what you take from clowning, a set of bright lycra tights and cute shorts are borrowed from the acrobat.  The point is to be inspired and not to actually look like you fly through the air with the greatest of ease, unless that’s exactly what you want.  Dot the background with extras that fit the scene.  The aptly named “Background” button offers a selection of these extras like a picture of cotton candy, or better yet, cotton candy colored/flavored lip gloss, a photo of balloons, a kitschy pin that reads “I’ve joined the circus.”  </p>
<p>Option B:<br />
The searches allow the ideas to come to you as they will.  It’s like browsing at the mall and finding things you didn’t even know you were looking for.  Polyvore keeps up with what’s new and hot so you can just type in dresses and see what’s available.  Something amazing at your price point might pop up—whoa, an awesome $30 dress at Old Navy!  You can build around that with similarly affordable pieces and then go into the world and get that outfit should you so desire.  Or, you can be like OMG Alexander McQueen dress that looks like a freaking fire-breathing dragon!!! And just plop that on your page as though the price wasn’t $5,000, your left nut and your firstborn child.  In this scenario you get to imagine what goes with this dress?  Where would I wear this dress?  and you continue on from there.  </p>

Think about proportions and shapes once you have your pieces on the page and/or while you’re picking your items.  So, if the shoes are the most amazingly detailed fantastic things you’ve ever seen and/or they are the anchor for the entire set, then maybe make them bigger than everything else on the page.  Keeping things really tiny and separated by white space is too scattered and visually distracting.  It’ll seem like the images don’t cohere even if they are well chosen.
<p>Also, consider balance.  If all the stuff you’ve picked is placed on one side of the page don’t leave a tiny pair of earrings hanging on the right, it’s lopsided.  You can anchor the right with something giant (like the shoes above) or you can re-size what you have and spread it out more evenly.  The same goes for color.  You can go monochromatic for a cool bold effect that also doubles as a theme, or you can be conscious of spreading color around to achieve balance.  Same issues occur here—too much red in one area can draw the eye to one yellow item that you don’t necessarily want to highlight.  Lastly, if all your  images are facing right, or pointing up, you can select the item and hit “flip” or “flop” to change their directionality and once again push for a more visually pleasing arrangement.  </p>
<p>Just be thoughtful as you arrange.  Think yearbooks, ads, paintings, photos, collages.  Look at other pieces that you like and borrow their artful positioning.</li>
<li>That’s it!  Once you’re done you can throw in some text or not.  Hit “share” to decide how to disseminate your creation (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr) and viola!  You’re a fashionista editor/stylist/sartorial artist!  Enjoy, and share your work with me &#8212; Tetris is a cruel mistress, but she can wait.</li>
