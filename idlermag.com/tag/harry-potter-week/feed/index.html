										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent a number of years working in a bookstore in the early 00s, starting shortly after the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> in 2000. For a character who has appeared in books, films, toys, stickers, a theme park, and who knows what else, it&#8217;s always amusing for me to remember that at the time there was no merchandise at all. As the bookstore industry even then was moving to include more of what was called &#8220;sidelines&#8221; on the sales floor, this disposed us to look on the Harry Potter books fondly and J. K. Rowling as one of us: A book person. We relished the stories of Jo, a single mother, writing <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> in a coffee shop. We thought of all the money even then that she was turning down by not selling stuffed owls, or plastic broomsticks.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6289" style="width: 218px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6289" data-attachment-id="6289" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/23/books-brooms-and-bad-video-games/hpvibratingbroom/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg" data-orig-size="348,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HPVibratingBroom" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=209" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=348" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=208&#038;h=300" alt="Broom" title="HPVibratingBroom" width="208" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6289" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=208&amp;h=300 208w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg?w=104&amp;h=150 104w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/hpvibratingbroom.jpg 348w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6289" class="wp-caption-text">Remember why they took this off the market?</p></div> This, of course, all changed with the release of the film version of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> in 2001. I don&#8217;t remember all the details, because I tried not to pay attention, but I&#8217;m sure there were Harry Potter Happy Meals as well as the coloring books, posters, picture books, and other movie tie-ins that took over my bookstore. It was the end of a particular innocence that we as bookstore people should probably never have lulled ourselves into. Jo was still clearly a wonderful writer, but she wasn&#8217;t just a book person. She wasn&#8217;t one of <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>And you know what? None of that matters. The books, the films, the fan art and fiction, all of it is worth every cheap piece of plastic sold with a Harry Potter logo. Harry Potter is <em>better</em> as something more than a book.</p>
<p>I make this assertion with some confidence, having read all the books (I started late, but I caught up fast), seen all the films (except the last one &#8212; I&#8217;ll get there), and having spent more time buried in Harry Potter lexicons, fan-written stories, and Wikipedia entries than I care to admit.</p>
<p>Which brings me to a rather odd admission: There have been a host of Harry Potter video games &#8212; at least one for every film, and even a <em>Quidditch World Cup</em> game in 2003 &#8212; and <em>LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</em> is the only one I&#8217;ve ever played. (You can read my final word on that game <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/07/07/no-more-legos/">here</a>, in case you missed it.) As much as I love Harry Potter, I avoid Harry Potter video games like the plague because movie tie-in video games are almost universally terrible.</p>

Adaptations should strengthen great characters and storylines. The plain fact of getting to encounter a character and story in a new form, not to mention all the little (or big) tweaks and changes necessary to make a story work in a different medium all <em>add</em> something to the greater whole. The book changes the way we see the film, and the film changes the way we read the book. Even running around on a cheap plastic broom changes the way we think about a Quidditch match, at least a little bit.</p>
<p>Video games should be a full-fledged part of this cross-media narrative exchange, and the only reason that they are not is that they are produced quickly and rushed to market, almost always constrained by the aesthetic and narrative determinations of the film they rehash. Even thinking of a game as an adaptation in its own right, rather than a marketing and merchandising tool, would be a huge step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Even better would be a game that tells a story of its own, in the universe suggested by but not limited to that created by a book or a film. There are plenty of good examples of this, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files_Game" target="_blank">the 1998 <em>X-Files</em> PC game</a>, to the recent <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Shattered_Dimensions" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_Edge_of_Time" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Edge of Time</a></em> games. (And, of course, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum" target="_blank">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em>.) The best adaptations tell their own stories, and the Harry Potter theme park in Orlando proves every day that there are large numbers of people who would leap at the opportunity to live in Harry Potter&#8217;s world for a while (or longer than a while).</p>
<p>So I&#8217;d like to make a suggestion. Who knows? The internet is a big place. Maybe, just maybe, word will get back to Jo herself. We need a new Harry Potter video game. Not one that revisits all the films in one 100+ hour multi-disc game. Not even a Harry Potter MMORPG. (Which would probably sell like gangbusters, and might even be cool, but it&#8217;s a little too obvious a place to start.) No, what I want is a game based solely on the Battle of Hogwarts and the preceding year at the school, maybe from Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley&#8217;s point of view. I want the story that we didn&#8217;t get in the book <em>or</em> the film. I want to get to flesh out two great characters who do really important things even though we don&#8217;t see that much of them while Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out camping. I want to direct the defense of the school. I want to cut off Nagini&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>You could probably even sell some controllers shaped like Godric Gryffindor&#8217;s sword. It would be worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gentlemen, witches and wizards, boys and girls, this, is a love fest. This is the story of a girl falling for a book. Never before has the world known such unabashed devotion. If <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> had a window I would have stood beneath it in the pouring rain tossing pebbles at the beveled glass. I would have held up a boombox blasting The Weird Sisters until my arms fell off.</p>
<p>But Harry didn’t have a window in his cupboard beneath the stairs, so instead I stood outside of bookstores counting down to midnight. I spent entire nights and the pre-dawn hours voraciously consuming 700+ pages of magic, defeat, and triumph. A decade later I waited outside amongst cloaked Quidditch enthusiasts of all ages, shivering in the November flurries, awaiting the midnight screening of <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1</em>. Despite my gut reaction, the division of the final movie into to parts was not cruel, but an act of mercy. A way to buy my childhood a little more time.</p>
<p>I was 13 when I read the first book. Marooned at a cottage with my family, I quickly blew through my arsenal of Christopher Pike’s <em>The Last Vampire</em> series, when I was forced to convince my sister (a year younger than me) to lend me her copy of <em>Harry Potter</em>. “Keep it,” she said, “I hate reading.” You guys,  I am resisting the urge to write a painfully lame line about keeping it forever in my <em>heart</em>. But, I totally kept that book. Twelve years later it’s on my shelf in Boston. <em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em> has moved with me more than 10 times.  </p>
<p>I read the entire novel in a single afternoon while eating Mackinac fudge like a true Michigander.</p>
<p>When I was 12 my mom gave birth to my sister Allie. I bided my time as she learned to  crawl, and then speak, and finally read, dying to introduce her to the truth, the light, etc. that was The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. She took her sweet time, dragging her feet along the ABC’s. Spending nearly a year with the good Dr. Seuss and finding the wild things.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_6270" style="width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6270" data-attachment-id="6270" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/07/21/magic-is-real-if-you-want-it/rowling_1231/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg" data-orig-size="295,340" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="rowling_1231" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=260" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=295" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=260&#038;h=300" alt="J. K. Rowling" title="rowling_1231" width="260" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-6270" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=260&amp;h=300 260w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg?w=130&amp;h=150 130w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rowling_1231.jpg 295w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /><p id="caption-attachment-6270" class="wp-caption-text">Thanks, Jo.</p></div> And then finally the day came.  She was eight. It was more or less the first day she could hold a novel that I shoved <em>The Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em> into her chocolate-frog sized hands.</p>
<p>I was desperate for another reader in the family. Four years later I am happy to report that my plan worked flawlessly. Allie has read every Harry Potter book at least five times. When she’s home sick from school we text each other Harry Potter trivia questions. Or rather, we did do this until she informed me she had an HP trivia book that I should really consider borrowing.</p>
<p>She knows everything there is to know about magical beasts. She’s been reading at a college reading level since sixth grade. She’s the coolest person I know. All of these things are connected.</p>
<p>Recently, while watching one of the early films Allie responded to my mother’s thoughtful question about spell logistics with, “Perhaps you should read the books.” Just totally shut her down. No one should mess with a girl when she’s watching her stories.</p>
<p>I know Harry and J.K. Rowling hard a hard go of it at first, what with the poverty, and manuscript rejections(!), and law suits from Christian associations that feared the magic in the books promoted witchcraft among children. About as valid as the fear that Twilight is leading youngsters down the glamorous road to necrophilia.</p>
<p>Even if you hate <em>Harry Potter</em> because you think it’s too mainstream, or rips off English lore, or is just plain beneath you, you should respect it. This Englishwoman, this single mother, created a universe that made millions of people, adults and children alike excited about reading. She changed my life forever. She made me a better person. She gave me hope, and showed me good wins out. And that’s the most magical thing I can imagine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, in a corner suite on the fourth floor of the very lovely Hotel Rouge in Washington, D.C.&#8217;s tony Dupont Circle neighborhood, I lay on a king sized bed, finished my quinoa/ dried berry / green leaf lettuce / dinner salad, and read the last ten pages of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em>.</p>
<p>For the first time.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Mind you, it&#8217;s no accident I made it this long without reading them. My roommate in college discovered the novel the summer after our freshman year &#8212; that would have been June, 1999. She adored it, and began reading each as it debuted, even organizing midnight Harry Potter parties at the independent bookseller in our hometown.</p>
<p>But I, ever the hater of all things beloved by everyone else, turned my nose up. Not only did my snobbish disdain for something I&#8217;d not read a word of give me the ability to do something unusual &#8212; that is, feel superior to my fellow English majors &#8212; it fit into my aesthetics formed &#8212; where else &#8212; in baseball.</p>
<p>To my mind, Harry Potter was like the Yankees: given every possible advantage for success without working hard enough to make the real fan, the burgeoning 18th c. literature aficionado, feel they&#8217;d earned it. British author? Check. Charming, if easy, narrative? Check check. Accessible for all? Checkity check check check.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. Harry isn&#8217;t a Yankee, though he is born under the burden of heavy expectation. He&#8217;s not Derek Jeter, a seemingly charmed (if likeable) hero. He&#8217;s certainly not Jason Giambi, or Alex Rodriguez &#8212; players who couldn&#8217;t seem to live up to their hype until they were lampreyed onto some greater player&#8217;s underbelly.</p>
<p>No, Harry was Johnny Damon. Johnny of an unknowable level of talent in his early years in Kansas City, Johnny with his lightning strike speed and freakish outfield instinct in Oakland. Johnny in Boston, not fully realizing until the 2004 ALCS, perhaps, just how great a foe he and his teammates were up against, Johnny and his ragtag gang of self-named misfits, the idiots, lacking pedigree and pinstripe. </p>
<p>The Yankees were Voldemort. (How else to explain A-Rod&#8217;s spectacularly nefarious swatting of the ball from the first baseman&#8217;s glove?) An evil, long-simmering force that took over seemingly decent people and turned them into entitled, unappreciative fan-monsters. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in any hurry to read the rest &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a stack of library books higher than Johnny&#8217;s current Mohawk taking precedence &#8212; but I&#8217;m finally learning the lesson about the book and the cover and judgment. Or, at least, the lesson about making sure you assign the correct judgment to said book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I’m in the process of moving across the country, cooking has been the farthest thing from my mind. I eat odd things at odd hours of the day and spend the rest of the time searching for things I’ve lost in one box or another, lamenting my less-than-stellar eating habits to anyone who will listen, and sleeping. Before I left, my aunts gave me a going-away present: <em><a href="http://bit.ly/qWO2Hf">The Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook: From Cauldron Cakes to Knickerbocker Glory&#8211;More Than 150 Magical Recipes for Wizards and Non-Wizards Alike</a> </em>by Dinah Bucholz. Because I’d planned my move around the midnight showing of the last Harry Potter movie, it was the perfect time to get out my wand (or, as my father so adorably called it, my “wizard stick”) and drown my sadness in some Harry Potter treats.</p>
<p>I spent my non-driving hours during the car ride from Boston to Michigan perusing the book and planning a Harry Potter lunch of epic proportions before the midnight showing. As the day got closer, I started to get unreasonably anxious. I often get anxious before large-scale events that have nothing to do with me (Spartan football games, Broadway musicals, and apparently midnight showings). It’s probably some sort of misplaced excitement, but as stupid as it sounds, the end of the Harry Potter franchise was a big moment for me. I’m only repeating what’s been said by anyone my age who started reading the series when they were the same age as the characters. (I was 12, and still young enough to believe that Hogwarts just might be real and my letter had just gotten lost. Yes, it probably wasn’t real. But maybe it <em>could</em> be.) As someone who reads every day, I still believe that I’ll never enjoy reading a book as much as I enjoyed reading the last Harry Potter book.</p>

<p>It may be that my quitting my job and moving from one coast to another coincided with what I’ll go ahead and call The Unofficial End of my Childhood, but I started to get more and more anxious about my big planned lunch. After weighing my options, I decided to downgrade to a snack, so that my epic lunch didn’t make me rushed and late for the movie. I chose to make some Pumpkin Pasties and pretend it was September 1 on the Hogwarts Express, partly because my dad already had most of the ingredients but mostly because the train has all sorts of adorable significance.</p>
<p>When I got to the grocery store, I had a sudden flash of panic. Why had I chosen <em>pumpkin</em>, of all things? It’s not like it’s an ingredient that’s filling the shelves in July. When I asked a worker, she took me over to the aisle and pointed at the small yellow sign: <em>Due to a small crop, canned pumpkin will not be available until the fall. </em>I tried not to have a full-scale meltdown. Apparently I’d attached much more significance to making this dessert than I’d realized.</p>
<p>“What are you making?” the woman asked. Even though I was wearing my Gryffindor scarf, I had moment of shyness and, instead of telling her the truth, I said simply, “A pastry.” “Well,” she said, “can’t you replace it with something? Maybe apple?” I tried very delicately not to lose my shit while I explained to her that it HAS TO BE PUMPKIN AND WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE. She made sure to tell me several times that all the stores in the area were out, and maybe I could just make something else. I said, “No, I really can’t.”</p>
<p>Instead of believing that twit, I went to Meijer. Lo and behold, they had plenty of cans of pumpkin. My adrenaline was pumping and I had a moment of instability where I wanted to go back to Kroger and shove the can of pumpkin in that woman’s face, or perhaps turn her into a bouncing ferret. But I figured my time would be better spent making pastries.</p>
<p>I mixed the butter, shortening, and flour together in the blender, since I had no food processor. The mixture was nothing like the light, fluffy texture it was supposed to be, but I thought I smelled the blender’s metal parts smoking, so I decided to just mix it together by hand and hope for the best. When I was done, the dough didn’t seem as doughy as it should have been, but the recipe specifically said it was better to be too wet than too dry. I wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>Next, for the filling, I stirred the godforsaken pumpkin together with cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg. At this point, I realized that I didn’t really have any idea what pasties were (and I knew I wouldn’t be using them in a burlesque show.) Thankfully, my friend Anna came over to partake and had done her research. The pasties should end up looking something like pierogi, filled with the pumpkin, folded over, and pinched on their sides.</p>
<p>I got the dough from the fridge and shaped it into small circles with my hands, since it was too sticky for a rolling pin. I dredged up some old knowledge from making homemade pierogi and started folding. I got too overzealous with the pumpkin filling and had to spoon some out of each pasty before it could close. I poked holes in the top of each to aerate them, and stuck them in the oven.</p>

<p>Anna and I passed the time watching Harry Potter-related videos (I recommend <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbH0nbilYek">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a9Z050teRY">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a9Z050teRY">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXuOj9d5o8">this one</a>). I decided to check on the pasties two minutes before their 30 were up, and was glad I did, because the thin edges were burnt. The inside, however, was perfect. The pastry was flaky but not dry, and the pumpkin was hot but didn’t burn. They were sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. They weren’t the prettiest, but they went well with my Gryffindor scarf and were a perfect appetizer to tear-soaked popcorn while I realized that I might be a Muggle after all.</p>
