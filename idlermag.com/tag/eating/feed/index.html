										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After finishing <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/07/09/convalescence-and-counting-calories/" target="_blank">my eating plan</a>, I promptly went up north with my family and boomeranged in the other direction. The cottage up north is a land filled with Cheetos and licorice and s’mores and beer. Our altar is the kitchen counter. It’s one of my favorite things about the cottage. But after doing my eating plan, my senses were attuned to the way we talk and think about food and our bodies. None of the men apologized for having some licorice or some chips with their sandwich. All of the women did. We apologized to each other or to ourselves or to the world.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have these cookies. But fuck it, I’m on vacation!”</p>
<p>“I don’t even want these chips. But I’m eating them anyway.”</p>
<p>“I should go running after this. But instead I’ll just be fat!”</p>
<p>We were transgressors. Inwardly I patted myself on the back like some kind of smug asshole for having the light beer or for drinking water instead of pop. <em>You don’t want to get fat</em>, I tell myself. As if getting fat is a disease you can catch; as if it’s the worst thing that could happen. I don’t own a scale and never really set much store by the numbers anyway &#8212; I’m a tallish and a little muscular, so striving for any number is never something I cared about.</p>
<p>Instead, I found other ways to care. I measure with my fingers how much fat does or does not spill over the front of my pants or how much my jeans fold around my thighs. I pinch the undersides of my arms to see how soft they are. I feel for my collarbone. I didn’t even realize I was doing it or that it’s a problem behavior until I heard it named online: “body-checking.” I was physically measuring my imperfections, checking to see if the disease had spread.</p>
<p>What was I afraid of? Why was I so afraid? I was a twiggy little kid. I grew up with a mother who ate healthily and exercised, but who was always loving and <em>never</em> shaming, never said anything negative about my body or appearance. I was occasionally teased for my crooked teeth or ridiculous hair, but only in the way that kids are sometimes mean, never to the extent of cruelty or bullying.</p>
<p>I watched and learned from the way other girls were treated that fat was bad. Fat was ugly. Fat was something I never wanted to be. With my frizzy hair and braces, I already had two things that the pretty girls did not have.  I was average-looking. If I got fat, I knew I’d be officially ugly. (I know this sort of thing inspires a chorus of people saying nice and reassuring things, which is so kind, but I am really not fishing for compliments. That was how I saw the world. I observed and paid attention and learned who was considered pretty and who wasn’t, and knew I was somewhere muddled in between.)</p>
<p>I figured that, if I could only stay thin, I could have a chance at being pretty. I’m grateful I have never crossed into eating disorder or excessive exercise territory. I never needed to be stick thin and I wanted to be strong. But I still spent plenty of time hating myself for the paunch on my stomach or the way my inner thighs always touched no matter how many squats I did. When I said, “I’m fat” or “I feel fat,” what I really meant was that I felt ugly. <em>Fat</em> was a bad word. (AN F-WORD IF YOU WILL.)</p>
<p>And then one of my friends said the following: “PSA: Using the word ‘fat’ to describe yourself when you are not actually fat (a yardstick is being able to shop in non-specialty mall stores) is kind of rude. As someone who has actually faced real, tangible, public discrimination for being fat, I would really appreciate it if we could put a hold on that word.” And then I started doing some thinking and doing some research. I watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XhTA4xOxCc" target="_blank">this video</a>. (HI IF YOU DON’T READ ANY OF THIS, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY JUST WATCH THIS VIDEO.) And I realized I was being a huge asshole (if unintentionally) to others and to myself. It never occurred to me that when I’m lost in my own neuroses, I could be hurting other people. All my fat-hate had been focused on myself and <em>never</em> on others, but it didn’t matter. I’d been using the word <em>fat</em> as a scapegoat, which is really just as awful and discriminatory as using the word <em>gay</em> to mean that something is bad or stupid.</p>
<p>So I’m trying to retrain myself. I’m trying to teach myself that <em>fat</em> is not a bad word. <em>Fat</em> is not an insult and shouldn’t be used as one, whether toward myself or toward others. <em>Fat</em> does not mean ugly or lazy or stupid or mean. Fat is fat. Some people are fat. I have some fat on my body. You can be fat and be still healthy. Being fat does not mean you’re ugly &#8212; my lovely friend who helped me to start thinking about these things is gorgeous as hell.</p>
<p>It’s difficult. It’s really difficult. But especially as a writer, I want to be conscious of what words mean and how I use them and try to not use them to harm myself or others. And fuck apologizing for that extra slice of pizza.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear readers, remember that time I said that counting calories was bullshit? Well, I still think that’s true. But now I’m just a hypocrite.</p>
<p>A few months ago, after six months of rock climbing and a long walk in bad shoes, I sprained my big toe. Despite being one of the lamest possible injuries, it meant that even walking was a challenge. I normally work out five or six days a week, but I really didn’t want to injure myself any worse.  I switched to a stationary bike, did push-ups as if I enjoyed doing push-ups, and tried to stop myself from complaining. I was not very successful. I thought if I just took it a little easy, my toe would go ahead and heal itself. But after three weeks, I was sort of able to walk but hadn’t gotten much better. So I went to the doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor told me I needed to quit doing everything for two weeks. Apparently my toe was too weak for even the friggin’ stationary bike. I realize it’s irritating for an able-bodied human like myself to complain about not being able to exercise. Feel free to skip ahead to the next paragraph where I get less irritating. But I depend on exercise to keep me from being a puddle of anxiety. I also have a hard time taking breaks from exercising, which I know has so much psychological subtext that I’m not even going to go there. Instead I came up with new habits like dusting the top ledge of the baseboard and cleaning the tiny ridges in the kitchen mat. But I was a good girl and listened to the doctor.</p>
<p>After exactly two weeks had passed and after more than a month of only half-assedly working out, I wanted to do something to jump-start being healthy again. I don’t own a scale so I only knew how much I weighed from going to the doctor’s office. And while I hadn’t necessarily gained weight, I had lost muscle tone and didn’t feel like my normal self. I felt lethargic and sad. I didn’t want to diet because fuck diets, but I had a new set of workout videos (<em>TurboFire</em>, of infomercial bleached-blonde fame). And the workouts came with a (wait for it) “5-Day Inferno Plan.” Apparently this eating plan would involve going to hell. Despite my hatred of diets and my worry of becoming too obsessive about counting calories, I decided to go ahead with the INFERNO.</p>
<p>The plan involved eating five effing times a day: a small breakfast, a snack, a small lunch, another snack, and a HUGE dinner with some sort of meat, vegetable, and grain. But it appealed to me because it was still actual meals with actual food (and allowed both cheese and coffee). It took me several trips to get everything because the food plan is VERY SPECIFIC about portions and measurements (which I actually enjoyed because it appeals to my control-freak side), and I didn’t want to mess with the calories. It also cost me nearly $130. (And I didn’t even buy their ridiculously expensive branded protein shake, but instead pilfered some of Charlie’s protein powder.) But by then I was literally too invested, so ONWARD.</p>
<p>Each of the days was paired with either a 50-minute cardio video or a 45 minute cardio + 15 minutes interval training video. The point was that all that work means you should probably be eating more, and mostly protein and vegetables with some brown grains. But even with five meals a day, it only averaged out to 1,200-ish calories a day. Charlie thought it was way too little, but I figured I was a tiny little woman and it would be fine.</p>
<p>I started off optimistic as hell. Here are some of the things I ate in the first few days:</p>

<p>I even got to eat bacon twice. Turkey bacon, but still. I discovered that cottage cheese with fruit isn’t terrible. Some of the recipes were actually delicious—like the egg salad pita, tuna salad, and the turkey avocado wrap. The others, not so much. The first three bites of the baked potato seemed good, considering it had cheese, sour cream, and bacon on it. But it turns out that one tablespoon of sour cream and one sad lonely slice of bacon just is NOT the right ratio for a baked potato. I ended up mostly choking down plain potato and feeling sorry for myself.</p>

<p>I was hungry all the damn time. 1,200 calories is not a lot of food. Do you know how little four ounces of meat is? I asked the man working at the deli counter for two four-ounce pieces of salmon and he <em>laughed</em> at me. Look at this dinner plate:</p>

<p>Not only did I have to scarf down bok choy (which tastes like the insole of a sweaty shoe), but look at the proportion of actual delicious salmon to vegetable and brown rice. I COULD BE EATING A BURRITO WHAT AM I EVEN DOING.</p>
<p>Even though I love having recipes tell me what to do, I got tired of constantly measuring out every little thing. I became obsessed with googling things like “How big is 6 oz of flank steak?” and “How many teaspoons is 3 oz of shredded cheese?” and other such EXCITING things. I didn’t have a food scale so most of the time I was just winging it and feeling like a failure. But then I started vowing that I&#8217;d do better. I started researching food scale prices. I would measure the 1/4 avocado exactly because those precise measurements would make me look and feel good. I’d gotten sucked in, become a slave to the ounces and to counting how many almonds I was eating.</p>
<p>On the third planned day, one of my friends wanted to go out. She was moving away, and it was one of the last days we both had free. I texted her that I was on a VERY IMPORTANT EATING PLAN and might not be able to go out. Was she free on Tuesday, once I was done? No, she wasn’t. I spent hours agonizing over what choice would make me a more terrible person.  My friend was moving many states away, and I had no idea when I’d see her again, versus messing up the plan and maybe having some of the $130 food go to waste. I didn&#8217;t want to give up on the plan because what did that say about me? That I couldn&#8217;t even commit five days to something? I didn&#8217;t want to give up on my friend, because choosing an eating plan over a friend is insane, right?</p>
<p>Eventually I decided that I didn’t want to be the biggest asshole on the planet and that I loved my friend. So I decided to screw the plan for a day and instead eat tapas and drink mimosas and sangria and I didn’t regret a single fucking minute.</p>
<p>After the day off, I finished the rest of the eating plan as closely as I was able. I have no idea (nor do I much care) if I lost any weight. The pictures I took of myself do show a little difference, and I learned how to snack like a grownup. I also learned that some vegetables (cucumbers, red peppers, zucchini) are actually good to snack on, and that almond butter on sliced apples is far superior to peanut butter. I felt like a healthy, active person again.</p>
<p>But I also learned that eating one waffle for breakfast is really depressing. I learned how easy it would be to start slowly shaving calories off my allotted amount. I learned that people don’t like hearing about eating plans, and how easy it would be to lie about what I’m eating. And I learned how quickly those grams of fat and 1/3 tablespoons make you feel like a good and put-together person.</p>
<p>I’d rather not be that sort of person. Instead I’ll maybe try to eat more vegetables and pay closer attention to portion sizes. I will continue to work out and teach myself to take more breaks. I&#8217;ll still be proud of myself when I eat well and work out harder. But I want to continue to be the person who would choose sangria with a friend over a bowl of vegetables by myself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sun is shining, birds are chirping, yes, even here in Michigan.  And because this is Michigan, the desire to break out of the house and leap into spring at a full gallop is strong.  And because I’m from New Mexico the desire to be out in the sunshine is even stronger.  And so I run &#8212; even though I hate running. </p>
<p>Beyond the difficulty of body &#8212; joints pounding, feet aching &#8212; I think the real pains of running for me are those inflicted and remembered by my mind. </p>
<p>I have/had eating disorders. Anorexia, chronic overeating, exercise bulimia. The temporality around “have” and “had” is fraught because there is no “all better” or “completely cured” with these illnesses. Even at my healthiest, the sick and self-defeating thoughts, the obsessions, and the self-hatred remain coiled and ready to attack at the slightest prodding or trigger.  A beautiful piece of frosted cake.  The mention of “bikini season.”</p>
<p>At my worst with anorexia, I was in high school and I would will my body awake at 5 a.m. to pound the pavement of my quiet neighborhood. I forced myself to run, not because I sought health or muscles or freedom, but because it expended calories and it had to do so faster than my endless wandering walking.  This “running” was slow and labored, my disease took the form of an apparition that would drag me forward by a fistful of my too-big t-shirt.  Belly empty, brain full of haze and stars, I was not only running on no breakfast, but the fumes of energy left over from the previous day’s diet.  </p>
<ul>
<li>milk, maybe cereal</li>
<li>skip lunch, pocket lunch money for weekend movies</li>
<li>1 can of low-cal soup for dinner</li>
<li>make sad sandwiches, hide them in dresser drawer to trick family, attract ants, change plan, flush food down the toilet</li>
<li>diet soda forever</li>
<li>low fat yogurt for dessert</li>
<li>perhaps some crackers for snacks, make sure to count them out, nibble them down, make them last</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to keep my daily calorie intake somewhere around 600 calories or less.  I’m sure I was much more precise then, however.  Anorexia is very much a numbers game, a running tally of intake and expenditures.  How many minutes did I run?  How many steps?  How many more can I stand before dying? </p>
<p>So, I’d run before school and sometimes again after school got out, but this second go round had to happen at the high school track so it wouldn’t look excessive to my family when I then popped an exhausted Denise Austin aerobics tape into the VCR and shuffled my zombie body back and forth across the living room carpet.  </p>
<p>At first, this routine was hard. Hunger screams and yelps and whimpers, howls through you.  But eventually you think you beat the system, that you’ve deprogrammed the feelings of starvation.  The hunger dissipates into a dull nothing and you float around on your imagined lightness, the concavity of your belly, and you take incredible pride (overweening, tragic flaw, will cause your downfall kind of pride) in conquering your body.  You’ve overcome human desire.  You are a GOLDEN GOD.  But a golden god can’t hang out with friends at a pizza parlour without worry, or pay attention to just about anything.  Golden Gods become golden by counting and numbering, dividing and multiplying.  There is no actual joy,  just a few rushes now and then borne of the power to deny and punish and hurt yourself and take it because, clearly, you deserve it.  </p>
<p>Your hair falls out in clumps in your shampooed hand. Your period stops. </p>
<p>The world falls away.  </p>
<p>When running, there is no release, rather an intense hanging on to what it means, could mean in terms of reduction.  Is the calorie expended yet?  Has it burned away?  When will I feel it, see it?  How long until I weigh myself again?  How much further can I push that little needle?</p>
<p>Last week, ten plus years after my worst bout with my body, I had a panic attack.  My Facebook feed is full of beautiful runners.  Real runners, runners who traipse through 5Ks before breakfast, Runners who rely on nutritious calorie-filled goos to power themselves through extensive training and amazing distances.  Athletes. Usually I am amazed by these people, motivated by them, or just so completely aware that I am not one of their ilk that I don’t even try to compare myself, but this past week, something tweaked and I saw these statuses of achievement and I lost it.  </p>
<p>My heart sank, my body (in my mind’s eye) grew about four sizes, my physical flaws magnified.  My skin prickled &#8212; it was so disgusted to be associated with me.  10 pm and I was 2 seconds from lacing up my sneakers and flying out the door. I was going to pound that pavement just like I used to, just ‘til it hurt and then a little longer, a little further.  Just ‘til I felt like retching and then maybe go some more.  I was gonna run into forever and not stop until i crumpled into a ball like the unfortunate possum or squirrel that dreamed too big, couldn’t make it across the street.  </p>
<p>Sweat is fat crying.  No pain, No gain. At least that’s what “motivational” pictures on the internet tell me.  </p>
<p>But then I didn’t lace my shoes.  I didn’t eat everything in the cupboard either (overeating is the other way I “deal” with stress and anxiety).  Instead I painted a picture.  Poured my nervous energy into fluorescent pinks and purples on a naked canvas.  This time, the running and eating, they waited.  I like to think it’s because I’m trying, really working and trying, to make them mine in a pleasurable way.  The beginning of my love story (a love of running, food, and self) first requires the elimination of punishment from my calculation of self worth.</p>
<p>I’m running, even if I don’t like it very much now, to find out if maybe I can peel back the memories of sacrifice and belittling, of the drudgery of each footfall, of the movement in circles around my neighborhood serving as a consequence of my failure to be perfect.  I’m hoping that underneath all those stories, I’ll break through to some place where I feel okay with my limitations, where running is a thing I can do, and not a thing I have to do. Though the wicked little calorie fears still linger, I’m pushing to find release.  Pleasure in the inhalation and exhalation of breath.  Power in the ability to move with speed while lapping up the sunshine like some Edenic creature.  I know I probably won’t get there fully, but I’m practicing getting closer.  I’m already really amazing at hating myself, pushing too hard, denying myself. Now, more than anything I’m practicing finding what feels good when I run.  It might not make the best internet meme, but I’m aiming for a less pain, some gain.  Revising the motto: Just Do It, but if it hurts, it’s okay to stop.  It’s okay to stop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I’m flying to the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) Conference in Chicago (a conference for writers, teachers, and book nerds of all varieties). It’s the first year I don’t have to sit at a table and force flyers into writers’ unwilling hands or present a paper that I’m only 20% sure is legitimate. I’m free to carry a flask (even if I fill it with water and only pretend it’s gin), wake up whenever I want, and be only marginally cooperative. I’m going to AWP to see old friends, meet people in real life that I’ve only ever met on the internet, maybe go to some panels and readings, and schmooze. Well, in my head I’m schmoozing; in reality I’m standing in the corner staring at someone important while I try to get the courage to go up and talk to him, and he walks away before I can make up my mind. I will not be eating.</p>
<p>Normally, eating is the highest of my priorities. Sometimes it’s even above getting dressed properly. I always eat three meals a day. If I don’t, my sugar level crashes and I become a monster whose superpower is whining and complaining about migraines, intent only on eating but also unable to decide what she wants or how to get it. My days are planned so that this monster stays penned up in her cage. But at AWP, it’s feast or famine. All my normal eating habits go straight out the window. I eat like a 10-year-old child left without a babysitter. My brain is too scrambled from the simultaneous presence of great writers and fear of looking like an idiot.</p>

Even though I made sure my face looks good, I keep head down to avoid eye contact. Pretend like I’m not a tourist like the twenty other conference-goers in line. I order a bagel. They are out of all but onion bagels. I order an oatmeal. They will somehow forget my order and I have to order again. Now I’m starting to run out of time to make it to the first panel. On the way out the door, I realize I’ve made no plan where to actually <em>eat</em> the oatmeal. I try to eat it while I walk, but the steam from the oatmeal fogs up my glasses and I can’t see. I drop the spoon on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Once I’m in the conference hotel, I sit in a corner behind a stray table and bend the oatmeal lid to use as a spoon. I hope no one can see me but of course someone I know will come up to say hello. I’ll have to hoist myself up from the ground to hug her. I will get oatmeal on her coat. I vow to get a portable breakfast sandwich tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I hurry to the first panel and sit down in a seat at the end of one of the rows, unwinding multiple scarves and trying not to breathe too loudly. Sitting at the end of an empty row means everyone has to step over me. But I will not yield because the hurry and the oatmeal have made me sweaty, and it’s best if I keep as far away from everyone as possible.</p>

Or not.</p></div> Once the panel is finished, I realize that, even though I’m not hungry, this will be my only chance to eat until dinner. I’d Yelped a cute lunch place nearby but there’s no time for that, so I duck my head and make a beeline for Subway. Half the conference had the same idea. We cram in next to the plastic tables and try not to graze elbows (unless the writer next to me is famous, in which case I WILL try to graze elbows). Everyone is fumbling with their conference badges and standing on their tiptoes to glare at the cashier, as if that will make the line go faster. I give up and leave. I bought my ticket to AWP and I WILL NOT spend it in a Subway.</p>
<p>While I climb the stairs to the next panel, I remember the peanuts. Every time I fly, I ask for peanuts and only eat one of the two little bags. It seems silly to throw it away, so I save the extra bag in my purse for some indeterminate time. I realize that NOW IS THAT TIME. Outside the conference room, I pour two salty bags of peanuts into my mouth so that the crinkly package doesn’t annoy everyone during the talk. I wash it down with a paper cup of free coffee.</p>
<p>By the time I’m supposed to meet up with my friends for dinner, I’m jittery and my blood sugar is so low I want to buy one of those $8 sandwiches they were selling in the lobby that were more bread than anything else. I know I’m on my way to dinner but I’m concerned I legitimately might not make it. When I get to the lobby, the caterers have gone home to their own dinners. I go back upstairs and walk from conference room to conference room, peeking in each until I find the leftovers from some reception or another. I dart in and grab a sad-looking smashed half of a brownie. To assuage my guilt and shame, I take one of their pamphlets. I never read it.</p>
<p>I meet my friends for dinner and we order all the courses, even though they make you pay extra for salad and bread. We order overpriced bottles of wine. We imagine ourselves a night full of telling stories with strangers, pretending we’ve read books we haven’t, and remembering why writing matters. Instead we are so full we end up in our beds early. I write myself a reminder to get a sandwich in the morning. I lose the note and fall asleep.</p>
<p>By the time I get home I’ll be craving fresh fruit like someone with scurvy. I’ll lay on the couch and eat apples and vow to eat like a normal human being next year. By next year I’ll forget, but I keep collecting extra bags of airplane peanuts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve read this column for any period of time you’ll know that onions and mushrooms are my sworn enemies. People who aren’t picky eaters tend to think I’m just being stubborn, and that they are the one who will convince me to drop my sword and end the fight. No, I don’t like onions, even in onion rings. I like fried things as much as the next girl, but the onions are still slimy, sluggy things I don’t ever want to ingest. Yes, I’ll still be able to tell even if you chop them up really tiny. I’m not just being an asshole; it’s the texture, not the taste, that bothers me. My reaction is completely beyond my control—if I accidentally bite into an onion, I either have to spit it out like a two-year-old or force myself to try and chew around it, which usually makes my eyes water because it’s so unpleasant. My body rejects them on my behalf.</p>
<p>Being picky in this way means that people like to make fun of you. For some reason, being picky about a few things makes people assume I’m picky about all things. In high school, my friend’s mother used her daughter to scout ahead with the dinner she planned to make before I came over. “My mom wants to know if you like wheat bread,” she would ask. “My mom wants to know if you like strawberries.” Of fucking course I like bread. Who doesn’t like bread? They seemed to think I would run away screaming and in tears if I ran across some mushrooms. High school is painful enough without looking like an uptight, boring asshat, so I have devised lots of neurotic ways to hide my picky eating that avoid both the sworn food enemies and the mockery.</p>
<p>At restaurants, I ask ask ask. I’m paying for that shit. It’s a huge bummer to pay for some food and then have to pick around most of it. (I am not good at sending things back.) Beware especially Mexican restaurants. They like to sneak onions in without mentioning them on the menu. If I suspect something might have onions or mushrooms, even in the sauce, I always ask. “I’m not sure if the burrito has onions, but if it does, can I have it without?” If you are there with friends, you shouldn’t have to explain yourself. If you’re with people you don’t know well or with coworkers, someone will inevitably be like “WHY DON’T YOU LIKE ONIONS ARE YOU STUPID,” at which point, instead of my usual treatise on the texture versus taste issues I have, I just lie and say I’m mildly allergic. This always makes people understand without having to discuss it further, and then deflects the conversation because people love to talk about their own food allergies.</p>
<p>At dinner parties, if I know the people well, I usually just tell them upfront that I have an aversion to these foods. Problem solved. If they put up a fuss, there’s always your “allergy” to explain. If I don’t know the people well, I ask to bring something. Even if it’s just some bread and cheese, I know I’ll have something to eat if they decide to make an onion tart or something. I never want to hurt someone’s feelings, especially because I think cooking is one of the highest forms of love, so instead I revert to trickery. It’s really easy to just take a small helping of the offending dish, cut it apart and smash it around a little bit to look like you’ve eaten something, then fill up on the dinner rolls. A childhood full of avoiding the green vegetables has made me an expert at sculpting a dish that looks eaten but hasn’t been.</p>
<p>The problem is that these methods are nowhere near 100% effective. Sometimes I’ll still get something at a restaurant with big hunks of onion. If I’m out with a professor I want to impress, I’m already a nervous wreck and trying avoid looking like an idiot. I could send the food back, but I think that makes me look like a snob (“Yes, hello, these onions offend my delicate tongue.”). I might as well just drink my pop with a pinkie in the air. I won’t send food back unless it’s not fully cooked. I hate having to spit out a bite of food because it makes me feel like an obstinate child (and maybe I am), but if I bite down on a crunchy piece of onion or a fatty piece of chicken, I don’t have much choice. Rather than just spitting it into a napkin (it turns out that most people know what you’re doing), I usually fake a sneeze into a napkin. Everyone’s dignity is spared, except for whomever has to launder the napkins.</p>
<p>Once, I was having dinner at a boyfriend’s house for the first time. His mother had made beautiful, miniature pot pies. When I cut one open, I went into a mild panic. It was filled with peas and onions and other things I couldn’t eat. I started eating the chicken and the crust, very slowly, hoping that if I could just eat it slow enough, maybe some of it would disappear. I was devastated because I was starving and the parts I could eat were delicious. I was clearly broken. I’d just started trying to move the vegetables around on my plate when his mother asked, “Do you not like it?” I’d already made a major faux-pas by starting to eat before they said grace, so I was dying to save face and did not want to offend her. The meal had clearly taken hours to prepare.</p>
<p>“Of course I like it! I’m just a slow eater ha ha ha!” I said. More than half the pot pie was still sitting on my plate, so I think we all knew it was a blatant lie, but I went ahead and shoved huge forkfuls into my mouth and smiled. I couldn’t swallow, so I hoarded the food away in my cheek like a chipmunk until his mother left the room to go get the dessert plate. I took the opportunity to fake-sneeze the food into my paper napkin, and hid the napkin in my pocket. For the rest of the meal, I nonchalantly dropped bites of pot pie into my lap, then stuffed the napkins into my bulging pockets. I waited until I got home to throw the napkins away.</p>
<p>If you ever see someone stealthily tucking away a mangled piece of chicken in their napkin, don’t be offended. We picky eaters do not want you to think your cooking is abysmal. It is not your fault. We are doing this because we don’t want to hurt your feelings. Please invite us again. Maybe next time we can just order pizza. But only pepperoni.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I learned that <em>The Idler</em> was going to devote a week to The Lady herself (Gaga, that is), I thought The F Word might have to opt out, due to obvious subject matter constraints. As I thought more about it, though, I started thinking about the reasons I named this column what I did. </p>
<p>While I think Americans like talking about food almost as much as they like eating it, I think that food can also become a bad word, especially for women. Indulgence is a sin, one always committed with excuses (A bad day at work. A bad boyfriend. I’ve been doing a juice cleanse for a month). Food can be a bad thing. Do you notice how you don’t want to be one who orders dessert first? “I’ll get one if you get one.” “We’ll be fatasses together.” It’s shameful to be the one who wants it. Unless, of course, you have someone else to balance your want for the dessert with feelings of regret afterward. I’d say it’s almost in fashion to think that you are fat. Or to say that you <em>think</em> you’re fat. No one wants to hear a woman say that she thinks she looks beautiful and thin today. Any compliments should be countered with something negative.</p>
<p>Woman 1: “Ugh, I ate so much at dinner today. I must have gained twelve pounds.”<br />
Woman 2: “Shut up. You’re so skinny.”<br />
Woman 1: “Well, my stomach is pretty flat, but I’ve pretty much resigned myself to big thighs.”<br />
Woman 2: “No way. I am so much fatter than you.”<br />
Woman 1: “Are you kidding? You have <em>hips</em>. I look like an eleven-year-old boy. And you have the best smile. My teeth are so hideous.”<br />
[Note: This is an actual conversation I’ve had. More than once. I’m no less guilty.]</p>
<p>On an on, a contest of who can out-ugly whom. Instead of focusing on what we like about ourselves, we’re looking for the flaws.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve noticed an upsetting trend where I don’t feel like I can say anything when I feel happy about the progress I have made. I’ve never been very overweight, but I definitely gained the freshman 15, and have worked about four years to get to a point where I have incorporated exercise and (mostly) healthy eating into a part of my daily routine. I make sure I balance cardio with weight training and with relaxation, like yoga. I went clothes shopping a month ago and fit into a size two pants for the first time. The only person I felt comfortable sharing my excitement with were my mom and my friend Anna, who has made a similar effort to be healthy and now can run half marathons in her sleep. And still beat everyone.</p>
<p>As I was typing that paragraph, I can feel a sense of ire from invisible readers. I felt afraid typing it. Even worse, I have a problem now where many of my pants don’t fit, so I worry about looking unprofessional at work, but don’t have the money to replace all of my pants. I realize this is very much a first-world problem. And, it’s barely even a “problem.” But I know that I can’t voice thoughts like this without someone saying “SHUT UP. YOU ARE SO SKINNY. YOU GO TO THE GYM ALL THE TIME. I HAD TO BUY A SIZE BIGGER PANTS YESTERDAY.” It’s not like I haven’t been there too. It’s not like I feel great about myself at all times. However, I’m really tired of the culture of self-hate. I’m tired of having to lie and say I’m so fat when I know I’m not. What’s wrong with our conceptions of food and our bodies if we don’t feel comfortable telling the truth about them?</p>

I’d agree that her body is far from the average woman’s body, but she’s not afraid to be as much of a freak as she wants. She feels free to appear in public in ridiculous hats or showing enough skin to incur some really unfortunate sunburns. She doesn’t give a shit about what you think. It’s not a shock that I saw lots of Gagas out for Halloween—what an opportunity for women to be as much of a freak as they want, and go to out without covering up, pulling down, checking and rechecking the mirror for telltale fat rolls. </p>
<p>On Halloween, I went to see <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> at midnight, where people were dressed as half boys, half girls, in lingerie, as Aeon Flux, men dressed as women, women dressed as men, women dressed as men dressed like women, and lots of skin all around. While it was definitely not something you’d want grandma to see, it was so refreshing to see a large crowd of people enjoying being themselves, comfortable in their bodies. </p>
<p>Obviously, there are health concerns to being overweight that should not be ignored. But, for the love of Gaga, can we please try to look for things that we like about our bodies, rather than picking on everything that we hate? As Gaga would say, “I want your love.” Or, alternatively, “Rah rah ah ah ah, ro ma, ro ma ma, ga ga ooh la la.”</p>
