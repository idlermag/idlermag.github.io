										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book you reread is different from the book you read the time before. You change. Your reading strategies change. The book expands to fill more of your life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about books I love, that I reread because I love both the experience of reading them and the experience of having read them deeply and as part of the rhythms of my life. But I don&#8217;t reread the same way every time, and I reread each book differently. My first few readings of many books usually conform to the genre reader archetype: I read for plot, to find out what happens, and then I reread to find out what I missed, to dwell on beautiful sentences and clear up confusion engendered by reading so fast. But my subsequent rereads are idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>Since I discovered the books of the amazing sf writer Samuel R. Delany in my teens, I&#8217;ve read my favorites several dozen times. As a younger reader I liked the shorter, more tightly plotted novels he wrote in the 1960s, in preference to his shaggy, more theoretical later books, with their uneasy sexualities and ambiguous endings.</p>
<p>Since it was one of those early favorites, I&#8217;ve reread <em>Nova</em>, his 1968 Holy-Grail-in-Space story, more times than I can count. The book starts with a wonderful set piece in a port on Triton, where we are introduced to Mouse, who plays a synesthetic instrument, the “sensory syrynx;” Katin, the character who is writing a novel and annoys me because he is so relatable and I see the bright-eyed college kid part of myself in him; and the brilliant, damaged Captain Lorq Von Ray, who is recruiting a crew for his trip into the sun on the <em>Roc</em>. The worldbuilding is great: everyone has plugs in their wrists and neck, to plug into ships and machines so that everyone can do actual work with their bodies. A scene takes place at a galactic museum. It is a wonderful, rich space opera story about history and writing and bodies and blindness and empires rising and falling.</p>
<p>But what I forget because of the way I reread is that this grail quest book is also a story of a bitter rivalry between the Von Ray and Prince and Ruby Red, owners of a huge company that makes spaceship machinery and controls mines of a Macguffin energy source, Illyrion. The story is told episodically with flashbacks to connections and clashes between the Reds and Von Ray &#8212; and Von Ray&#8217;s doomed romance with Ruby. But I always skip the flashbacks, because Prince Red is cruel and violent and Ruby is duplicitous, and I care more about Mouse and Katin than about the clash of empires. So the epic story, upon multiple rereads, has become for me a story about very different people brought together on a ship, and their picaresque, important travels across the galaxies talking about technology and writing and life and history.</p>
<p>But because I skip the Prince Red parts doesn&#8217;t mean I just reread a few pages or scenes I like. I reread probably two-thirds of the book. The parts I love don&#8217;t make sense without the experience of having (mostly) read up to that point in the book. The process of reading matters. And the parts I love have a different valance when they&#8217;re less inflected by the cruelties of Von Ray&#8217;s youth. Often the books I reread are different than on the first read for more subtle reasons, paragraphs that suddenly jump out, motivations that are suddenly revealed. But when I reread <em>Nova</em>, given the parts I skip, I literally read a different book.  And I love that book too.</p>
