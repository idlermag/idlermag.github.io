										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TV advertising and the insane amount of heart themed decorations at my local supermarché have notified me that Valentine&#8217;s Day has rolled around yet again. I’ve mentioned before <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/14/what-are-you-doing-for-valentines-day/">I don’t really care about this “holiday.”</a>  It might sound like I’m trying to be cool with the anti-Valentine&#8217;s Day attitude, but I seriously don’t think about it. Now, happily married (I’m really not trying to be a bitch about this if you’re Pro-V and single), Valentine&#8217;s Day just isn’t important. . . unless you’re going to go ALL OUT for it.</p>
<p>February of 1998 I celebrated Valentine&#8217;s Day with my high school boyfriend with the most clichéd date in the history of clichés.  We had a romantic (read: Italian) dinner at a local eatery, I was presented with flowers and a heart shaped box full of candy, and we went to the movies to see THE MOST craptastically romantic movie that ever wooed an entire generation of adolescent girls: <em>TITANIC</em></p>
<p>OH YEAH.</p>
<p>Cheesiest Valentines Day EVER. For me, anyway.  I was too young to get a marriage proposal from my true love on top of the Empire State Building after finding a ring in my champagne glass while a brass band played “All You Need is Love” with fireworks going off in the background and a fuck ton of white doves flying over our heads after an dinner where we shared a comically long spaghetti noodle while two Italian characitures serenaded us, so I settled for watching <em>Titanic</em>.  (This is what everyone was striving for in 1998, right?  I have no idea)</p>
<p>Anyway, this year I plan to top it.  Husband is in Moscow on this heartiest of days for a conference (it’s when the best miserable Russian weather is in season, really) and I’ll be home alone.</p>
<p>But, wait, I hear nobody say, how will you make Valentine&#8217;s Day cheesy with all sorts of love <em>sans</em> husband??</p>
<p>WITH EFFIN’ NACHOS, man!</p>
<p>A couple of dear friends and I are actively taking part in making Valentine&#8217;s Day cheesy  via <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html" target="_blank">a homemade cheese sauce</a> and watching anything and everything romantically ridiculous on Netflix and YouTube.  I’ll miss Husband, of course, but in his absence I really can’t think of anything more cheesy and beautiful than nachos and THUMBTANIC.*</p>

<p>Happy Valentines Day, everyone!  I hope <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiIsEgC3Wc" target="_blank">all your thumbs go on</a>!</p>
<p>*Disclaimer: I did not discover &#8220;Thumbtanic&#8221; by myself.  I happen to be friends with some awesomely wacky people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never cared much about Valentine’s Day, one way or the other. I don’t moon over a romantic evening or loudly proclaim that it’s some corporate bullshit designed to play on our tender emotions in order to get us to buy diamonds and chocolate. I’d rather get worked up over something important, like getting blue-shelled at the end of a <em>Mario Kart</em> race. Even though Saint Valentine was a pretty cool guy, Charlie and I take the opportunity to spend some time together and maybe eat some excellent food, rather than buying gifts.</p>
<p>As usual, though, I decided to bake my heart out and charm Charlie with something neither of us should be eating. In general, we eat pretty healthy, so I like to use as much butter and sugar as possible when I make a treat. I’d had this recipe for <a href="http://bakeitinacake.com/recipes/doublerainbowcupcakes" target="_blank">Double Rainbow Coconut Cupcakes</a> from the wonderful Bake It in a Cake website saved on my computer for months. If you would like to salivate over some amazing recipes, go there. She literally bakes things into cakes and cupcakes. It’s genius.</p>
<p>The recipe is immensely complicated, which is part of the reason I chose it. Baking feels natural to me &#8212; with all its exact measurements, way easier than cooking &#8212; so I like to try something difficult and see if I can do it without screwing up too badly. And this recipe has MARZIPAN RAINBOWS baked inside coconut cupcakes, topped with buttercream frosting and rainbow coconut. It needed three and a half sticks of butter. The only answer is yes.</p>
<p>A warning: If you want to make this yourself, marzipan is EXPENSIVE. I paid $14 for two packages, which only made 12 cupcakes. Another warning: Cream of coconut is near impossible to find. I tried three different grocery stores, including Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods. On the morning I planned to make the cupcakes, I drove back to Safeway with my hair disheveled and without having eaten breakfast and tried to recall all the research I’d done. At last, I found a sad, discounted squeeze-bottle of coconut cream next to the liquors &#8212; in addition to baking, it’s also used to make piña coladas. I went home triumphant, rolled up my sleeves, and began.</p>
<p>Marzipan is almond candy dough. I divided it into six sections, and started to dye them. I had no idea how much food coloring to use, so just squeezed some on and started smooshing it around like Play-doh. The red made my hands look like I’d murdered someone. It was fun as hell, even though it took an immense amount of time. I kept having to stop and wash my hands to keep the colors from bleeding and to sprinkle powdered sugar to keep the marzipan from getting too sticky.</p>

<p>Then, I had to roll out the each of the colors into long strips, which I’d then stack in order to make the rainbows. I don’t have a rolling pin, so I did the civilized thing and rolled the dough into little snakes with my hands, then used a plastic cup and my fingers to roll it flat. I’m completely incapable of measuring anything spatially, so I used a tape measure to make sure each strip was as close as possible to the 12 inches x 2 inches the recipe recommended. The dough stretched and broke a lot, and I worried that the rainbows wouldn’t look very cute and ALL WOULD BE LOST.</p>

<p>I trimmed the end and the sides with a butter knife to make right angles, anxiety-eating most of the leftover dough as I went. Then, I cut the rainbows into 12 pieces. I shouldn’t have worried, because they turned out so fucking cute.</p>

<p>The recipe had called for toasted coconut. While on my quest for cream of coconut, I’d looked for pre-toasted coconut, but I have no idea if that actually exists. I never did find it. How hard could it be to toast my own coconut? While I was playing with the dough, I’d put a cup of coconut on a baking sheet and put it in the oven for five minutes at a time, according to the internet. I used a near-empty bag of coconut that had been in my pantry for longer than I care to admit &#8212; I figured it would be safe after it had been toasted, then baked. The coconut was done after only ten minutes. It probably could have toasted longer, but I was afraid it would burn.</p>

<p>Next, I mixed the dough and poured it into the cupcake pan, two tablespoons at a time. I used skim milk rather than the whole milk the recipe called for, as if that made up for the three and a half sticks of butter. I’d also used wheat flour &#8212; not because it’s healthy, but because I’m lazy and it’s what I had on hand. Then, I pressed the rainbows into the batter. They looked enormous, especially on top of the two tablespoons of batter in each cup. The cups nearly overflowed even before I topped the rainbows with dough.</p>

<p>The recipe told me I shouldn’t press the rainbows all the way down to the bottom, but I had to press them in a little to keep the dough from running over. All my alarm bells were going off like YOU ARE SCREWING IT ALL UP but there was no stopping the rainbow cupcake train. I put the cupcakes in the oven.</p>

<p>While the cupcakes baked, I started to dye the coconut for the topping. I almost skipped this step because it’s so pointless, but I knew it would be so effing adorable that I couldn’t resist. My food coloring is made of gel; I couldn’t get it to mix with the coconut. I decided to mix the gel with water, and dumped the water in the coconut. It was pretty and soggy. The coconut probably wasn’t supposed to be wet, but at least it looked good.</p>

<p>I whipped together the butter and powdered sugar to make the buttercream frosting, and checked on the cupcakes. They were HUGE. I sat in front of the oven and watched the batter creep toward the edges of the pan like it was going to fall off a cliff. It was all very dire. After 25 minutes, I pulled the cupcakes out. The kitchen smelled incredible, but they were some ugly, lopsided fuckers. I could see the rainbow peeping through the wrappers and worried that the marzipan had melted.</p>

<p>Feeling disheartened, worried that I’d wasted too much time and money on this ridiculous idea, I was decidedly un-Valentiney. Once the cupcakes were cool, I frosted them and sprinkled the dyed coconut on top in miniature rainbows. They were cute as fuck, even if they still looked a little wonky and I had no idea how they would taste.</p>

<p>Turns out, there was a reason to warn against pushing the rainbows all the way down. The marzipan had sank to the bottom of the cupcake and fused to the wrappers. If you were careful, you could peel the wrapper off and only eat a minimal amount of paper.  But dear sweet Saint Valentine did they taste incredible.</p>

<p>It took me three hours to bake and nearly 45 minutes to clean up the kitchen, but I believe Charlie’s exact words were, “Holy shit.” That’s love. Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone.</p>
<p><em>Postscript</em>: For next time, I’d use white flour. It would be so much prettier that way. I’d also cut the rainbows much smaller so they won’t stick to the bottom, and make smaller cupcakes. I ended up with a lot of extra dough, but I’d run out of cupcake wrappers. I had so much extra that I attempted to make more plain cupcakes AND a cake, both of which stuck to the pan. I ended up digging pieces of them out with my fingers and dipping them in the extra buttercream, then throwing the rest away. It was after midnight before I awoke from my sugar coma and was able to eat normal food.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you happen to be someone who was alone, forgotten or rejected on Valentines Day you may be thinking: Hell, even a damn dirty ape can get a date, and they don’t even have to send flowers!  Why not me?!”  Well, here’s a thought to cheer you up:</p>
<p>Yes, even stupid animals can find a partner, but there’s no way their mating rituals would work in the harsh dating world of the human race.</p>
<p>Consider, for instance, these courtship strategies from the animal kingdom.  I have translated the animal behaviors into human dialogues to display the various degrees of failure that would ensue:</p>
<p><strong>1. The giraffe method</strong> <img data-attachment-id="3767" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/15/5-leas-unromantic-animal-mating-rituals/giraffe-tongue/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg" data-orig-size="640,577" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Giraffe Tongue" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=300&#038;h=270" alt="giraffe" title="Giraffe Tongue" width="300" height="270" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3767" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=300&amp;h=270 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=600&amp;h=540 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/giraffe-tongue.jpg?w=150&amp;h=135 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>How can you tell she’s ready to go all the way?</p>
<p><strong>Guy:</strong>  Hi.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Hi.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> On your way to the bathroom?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> No.<br />
<em>Guy slaps her bottom a few times</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> How ‘bout now?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Yes, now I have to pee.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Oh good, could you save me some?  Here’s a mug.<br />
<em>A few minutes later, the Guy sips from the mug full of urine from the Girl who, for the purposes of this joke, has not yet run away</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Your urine is great!   Will you sleep with me?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> No.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Please?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> No. I’d like to keep my options open, if you don’t mind. I like older guys.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Okay, I’ll just follow you around all night with urine breath until you change your mind.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Oh, please don’t.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> No, it’s cool.  I’ll just be right next to you in case that older dude doesn’t show up. Then you can take pity on me.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong>  Security?</p>
<p>That’s right.  A male giraffe spots a female, head-butts her to induce urination so he can taste it to see if she’s ready to mate, and then follows her relentlessly until she gives in or another male shows up and they fight it out.  Fail.</p>
<p><strong>2. White-fronted parrot method</strong> <img data-attachment-id="3768" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/15/5-leas-unromantic-animal-mating-rituals/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01.jpg" data-orig-size="500,448" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="CR09gParrotWhiteFronted01" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01.jpg?w=500" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01.jpg?w=300&#038;h=268" alt="parrot" title="CR09gParrotWhiteFronted01" width="300" height="268" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3768" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=268 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=134 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/cr09gparrotwhitefronted01.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>When this lovely green bird goes after a mate he does so by locking beaks with a lady bird.  Kissing.  Normalish, yeah?  Wait for it. . .</p>
<p><strong>Guy:</strong>  Well, hello.  You’re very beautiful<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong>   Why thank you.<br />
<em>They kiss</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> That was wonderful<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I think I love you.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> I think I love you too.<br />
<em>Guy vomits into Girl&#8217;s mouth</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Ack! Gross! What are you doing?<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I’m showing my love for you by sharing my food!<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Sharing?  You just vomited in my mouth!<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Yep.  Mozzarella sticks. You like?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Get lost.</p>
<p>For these birds, second base is the male regurgitating the contents of his stomach into the female’s mouth. Maybe bird vomit tastes better than human vomit, but still. Ick.</p>
<p><strong>3. Bonobo method</strong> <img data-attachment-id="3769" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/15/5-leas-unromantic-animal-mating-rituals/bonobo9yg/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bonobo9yg.jpg" data-orig-size="300,208" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bonobo9yg" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bonobo9yg.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bonobo9yg.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bonobo9yg.jpg?w=640" alt="bonobo" title="bonobo9yg"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-3769" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bonobo9yg.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/bonobo9yg.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>These little apes engage in sex for almost everything.  Sounds awesome, right?  Let’s see if there can be too much of a good thing. </p>
<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Hello.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Hi.<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Meet my brother<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Meet my sister<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I’m hungry<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Look! A restaurant!<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> I’m angry with you for not paying for our meal!<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Don’t be angry!<br />
<em>Lovemaking ensues</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> I’m sorry we almost got in an argument!<br />
<em>Lovemaking is initiated. . .</em><br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Whoa, whoa whoa. Look, I’ve had about enough, okay? Five times in the last hour including an orgy with our siblings, and I&#8217;m exhausted, all right?  This isn’t fun anymore.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> You’re tired?  We should probably have sex to wake you up!<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Count me out.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Okay then, where’s your sister?</p>
<p>Bonobos use sex as a means of greeting. They have sex when they’re excited about finding food. They have sex instead of fighting or violence to resolve conflicts. (Holy crap, are they more advanced than us?) This means they have a less violent society as they tend to just, erm, “hug” everything (<em>everything</em>) out, but, seriously, who can keep up with that sort of lifestyle? Besides, as mentioned in the above dialogue, their social boundaries are way less strict. As in, it’s all in the family. Ew.</p>
<p><strong>4. Anglerfish method</strong> <a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="3770" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/15/5-leas-unromantic-animal-mating-rituals/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg" data-orig-size="500,255" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="tumblr_krk4v66ySn1qz7tiao1_500" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg?w=500" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg?w=300&#038;h=153" alt="anglerfish" title="tumblr_krk4v66ySn1qz7tiao1_500" width="300" height="153" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3770" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg?w=300&amp;h=153 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg?w=150&amp;h=77 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/tumblr_krk4v66ysn1qz7tiao1_500.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Ever have the feeling she wants a little more than you&#8217;re willing to give?  </p>
<p><strong>Girl:</strong> Hullo.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Hi, looking for a mate?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> As a matter of fact, I am. But I don’t actually want to look at you, talk to you, or have you around for any other reason than to fertilize my eggs.  Can you live with that?<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Sure!<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> I just need you to gnaw into my intestine and stay there until you dwindle down to an appendage full of sperm that can do its thing whenever my hormones tell you there are eggs to fertilize.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> So I’d lose my brain, heart and eyes and all sense of feeling?  What’s in it for me exactly?<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> It would make me. . . happy?<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Pass.</p>
<p>Yep.  Male anglerfish just attach themselves to a female and dissolve down to nothing but glands, making the female anglerfish an independent woman.  All the women who are independent throw your fins up at me.</p>
<p><strong>5. Hippopotamus method</strong> <img data-attachment-id="3771" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/15/5-leas-unromantic-animal-mating-rituals/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania.jpg" data-orig-size="400,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania.jpg?w=400" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="hippo" title="van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3771" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/van-zandbergen-ariadne-hippopotamus-hippopotamus-amphibius-in-river-katavi-national-park-rukwa-tanzania.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Aromatherapy, anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Hellooooo beautiful.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Uhm, hi.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Did you see what I did over there at the bar?  I fought all those other guys.<br />
<strong>Girl:</strong> Yeah, I saw. I’m not really impressed.<br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Well then, allow me to show you another little trick of mine.<br />
<em>Guy drops his pants, turns around, proceeds to urinate and defecate in front of Girl</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> What do you think of that?  Pretty hot, right?<br />
<em>Girl recoils in disgust and runs away</em><br />
<strong>Guy:</strong> Wait! If you go all the way over there you can’t smell my poop! Here, I’ll shake my ass around so the scent can waft over to you! Where are you going?</p>
<p>Male hippos impress potential special lady friends by fighting at the old watering hole with each other and pooping themselves. The odor apparently does the trick for female hippos. Good for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong>: I&#8217;m not really the romantic sort. That said, I&#8217;m facing a perfect storm this Valentine&#8217;s Day. It&#8217;s the ten-year anniversary of my first date with my wife. (Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Our first date was on Valentine&#8217;s Day. What?) We eloped exactly six months later. And a year after that, we did a ceremony with our families.</p>
<p>So this February 14 is the official start of the year of the ten-year-anniversary. (My wife has already started celebrating unofficially by marking the dates of our first kiss and the day she broke up with her boyfriend of the time.)</p>
<p>My wife and I were housemates before we started dating, and we really started to realize (or admit to ourselves) that we were going to start seeing each other because we&#8217;d curl up on the couch every evening and watch <em>Michael Palin&#8217;s Hemingway Adventure</em> on PBS together. So I bought her a copy and we&#8217;ll spend Valentine&#8217;s Day curled up on the sofa watching it again. (After the kids go to bed, of course.)</p>
<p>So maybe I&#8217;m a bit of a romantic after all.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: I&#8217;ll probably be avoiding facebook and Twitter, because people will be really gross and mushy or will be whining about how they are SO ALONE and I&#8217;d rather not see that. My boyfriend and I don&#8217;t get each other gifts for Valentine&#8217;s Day; we&#8217;d rather spend the day doing something fun. We have a belated date planned for when he comes to visit me in March, and I&#8217;ll be sending him some homemade candy. Or crying over videochat. Either one.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Malta</strong>: Probably using it as an excuse to eat a little candy or two…or ten (not those chalky message hearts, those are gross).  Valentine&#8217;s Day, for me and Husband, is overshadowed by the “Christmas in February” also known as February 13th, Husband’s Birthday.  I happily take the out since I&#8217;m not really enthusiastic about Valentine&#8217;s Day.  Maybe I’m a little jaded, but on the whole I see no point on putting so much pressure on one day in the middle of winter when, let’s face it, everyone in the world is really effing cranky (in Michigan, anyway. –11 degrees with the wind chill making it feel more like I’ll go off my flipping rocker if it takes me longer than one second to get from the front door to my car and I’m supposed to feel romantic all of a sudden?  Not happening).  I&#8217;ve always told Husband I don&#8217;t care about it and we are under no obligation to observe it.</p>
<p>That said, I did give him a Valentine one year.  I used it as a means to make Husband retire one of his favorite jokes. He had explained to me, in jest, that since Pandas wouldn’t/were too stupid to mate to save themselves from extinction we should be able to eat them because they’re on their way out anyway.  Sometimes when I’d ask what he wanted for dinner he’d say “Panda Meat” because he liked to make me mad.  Pandas, in my opinion, are not for eating.</p>

He got a Valentine from a little Beanie Baby Panda. His soft, bean filled paws offered a Caramello bar (Husband’s favorite) and a little heart shaped sign that read, “Please don’t eat me.  I love you.”</p>
<p>It was a turning point for Husband.  He would never again be able to think about consuming the meat of a Panda without thinking of chocolate and love and the most pathetic tone I could muster for the voice of the adorable little Beanie Baby.  If we do anything on Valentine&#8217;s Day it is to remember that we don’t eat Pandas.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Sloan</strong>: I&#8217;m celebrating Valentine&#8217;s Day by not celebrating Valentine&#8217;s Day. I&#8217;ll be drinking ghetto blasters and writing snarky things on the internet like every other Monday. This is not just because I&#8217;m single; my hope is to one day find someone who enjoys these things, too. That way we could do them together on V-day. Last year I celebrated by going to the Dirty Show in Detroit&mdash;if it&#8217;s running this year (Ed. note: <a href="http://dirtydetroit.com/">It is</a>) and you&#8217;re looking for plans, I highly recommend it: alcohol, cute people, and art. There&#8217;s something for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: What am I doing for Valentine&#8217;s Day? Well, nothing formal. The wife and I will work all day, the kids will do their thing at school and we&#8217;ll pick them up and bring them home. Then my wife will go to her ice skating lessons so she will be able to take our son to the skate rink while I stay home with the kids. Hopefully they will both be tired and fall asleep easily so my wife and I can have a little bit of quiet time.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to Valentines from any of my students. The agency where I work doesn&#8217;t celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day in the classroom but we&#8217;re not stopping families, especially those with siblings that are celebrating in their schools, from bringing in cards to quietly disperse throughout the day. I hope the kids remember me!</p>
