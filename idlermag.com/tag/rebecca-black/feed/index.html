										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven’t heard, dear readers, there’s a new crap sandwich in town and this shit is gourmet.  It’s served on fancy artisan bread with hand cut shoestring potatoes fried in truffle infused oil and a somehow snooty pickle spear on a bed of arugula.</p>
<p>It’s Rebecca Black’s “Friday.”  </p>
<p>Upon hearing how bad this song was supposed to be my curiosity bested me.  The ensuing audio-visual assault left me wanting to do <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY6PXoyNP1k">this</a>.  </p>
<p>Seriously.  </p>
<p>It’s really bad.  </p>
<p>And it’s been stuck in my head for days.  </p>
<p>If you haven’t heard it yet <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0">DON’T GO HERE</a> to discover how atrocious it is unless you want to deliberately destroy your sanity.</p>
<p>If you do choose to listen/watch, be forewarned.  Side effects include, but are not limited to: extreme confusion, bemused but frustrated giggle fits and awkward laughter, multiple exclamations of “WTF!?”, headaches, urges to obnoxiously sing the lyrics aloud to yourself, and divorce if you play it loud enough to wake up your napping spouse. (Husband is already looking for apartments.)</p>
<p>In an attempt to exorcise this infectious ironic Internet phenomenon from myself, and because you’re possibly very curious about it now, I present this lyrics-and-video-play-by-play-narrative-deconstruction/commentary.  It required repeated inflictions of the offensive material and I had to do shots to psych myself out before hitting play.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GWdwnNRk34?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The song/video begins with typical optimistic buildups of “Ooh”s and “Yeah”s as we see pages of a day calendar removing themselves one by one.  </p>
<p><em>Seven a.m., waking up in the morning<br />
Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs<br />
Gotta have my bowl, gotta have cereal<br />
Seein&#8217; everything, the time is goin&#8217;<br />
Tickin&#8217; on and on, everybody&#8217;s rushin&#8217;</em></p>
<p>Rebecca prepares for school.  Whoop-dee-whoop. Not the most exciting set up, but I can roll with it.</p>
<p><em>Gotta get down to the bus stop<br />
Gotta catch my bus, I see my friends (My friends)</em></p>
<p>A convertible full of attractive youngsters drives up.  None of them are wearing seatbelts as they beckon to Rebecca to join them in a, “Hey, hop into the Tragic and Untimely Death-mobile” type way.  Viewers may wish this to be foreshadowing, but despite the song/video being a wreck, there is (sadly) no car crash.</p>
<p><em>Kickin&#8217; in the front seat<br />
Sittin&#8217; in the back seat<br />
Gotta make my mind up<br />
Which seat can I take?</em></p>
<p>OMG!  Everyone knows if you didn’t call “shotgun” you sit bitch!  </p>
<p>This moment makes me want to punch a baby.  The music implies something important is about to happen as it builds up to debut the chorus. Will it be a moment of jammin’ rewards, perhaps?  </p>
<p>Wait for it. . .</p>
<p><em>(Chorus)<br />
It&#8217;s Friday, Friday<br />
Gotta get down on Friday<br />
Everybody&#8217;s lookin&#8217; forward to the weekend, weekend<br />
Friday, Friday<br />
Gettin&#8217; down on Friday<br />
Everybody&#8217;s lookin&#8217; forward to the weekend<br />
Partyin&#8217;, partyin&#8217; (Yeah)<br />
Partyin&#8217;, partyin&#8217; (Yeah)<br />
Fun, fun, fun, fun<br />
Lookin&#8217; forward to the weekend</em></p>
<p>Yeah, you mentioned that. And I would like to mention, as someone who’s had voice instruction, the way you spread your vowels when singing, “Fryeedayee”, makes me cringe.  </p>
<p><em>7:45, we&#8217;re drivin&#8217; on the highway</em></p>
<p>Suddenly it’s nighttime and Rebecca still sits bitch in back of the convertible, but she and her friends are seated on top of the car, so we know they’re really having fun.</p>
<p><em>Cruisin&#8217; so fast, I want time to fly</em></p>
<p>Five teens in a convertible, no seatbelts, speeding, and three of them aren’t seated safely?!  Where the eff is the fuzz? Or a car crash?</p>
<p><em>You know what it is</em></p>
<p>No.  What?  Tell me, what?!</p>
<p><em>I got this, you got this</em></p>
<p>WHAT?!  What we got?!</p>
<p><em>My friend is by my right, ay<br />
I got this, you got this<br />
Now you know it</em></p>
<p>Don’t you tell me what I know!!</p>
<p><em>Kickin&#8217; in the front seat<br />
Sittin&#8217; in the back seat<br />
Gotta make my mind up<br />
Which seat can I take?</em></p>
<p>We covered this!  </p>
<p><em>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Yesterday was Thursday, Thursday</em></p>
<p>Someone took her vitamin “duh.”</p>
<p><em>Today i-is Friday, Friday (Partyin&#8217;)</em></p>
<p>Yes. . . and?</p>
<p><em>We-we-we so excited<br />
We so excited<br />
We gonna have a ball today</em></p>
<p> Are these lyrics written by a first year foreign language student?  Where are the verbs?</p>
<p><em>Tomorrow is Saturday<br />
And Sunday comes afterwards</em></p>
<p>Yes, but what’s after Sunday?  The Apocalypse? Please?!</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t want this weekend to end</em></p>
<p>But you said earlier you wanted time to fly!  Gotta make your mind up, Rebecca.</p>
<p>I’d say it’s a great tune for kids (easy, clean lyrics, etc.), except I’m worried a child’s musical ear could be permanently damaged.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s infuriatingly catchy.  If you hear it I guarantee it’ll infect your brain for a minimum of seventy-two hours and drive you mad.  </p>
<p>And forget about antidotes.  I’ve tried all of these:</p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzllVlzzeuo">The Wonders</a></p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykwqXuMPsoc">The Narwhal song</a></p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJkPWMaNaIM">Bananas in Pajamas</a></p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cVlTeIATBs">Dumb and Dumber</a></p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUyRS3dEr0o">This</a></p>
<p>And in an act of desperation, <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA">this</a></p>
<p>There is no cure.</p>
<p><a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GaKaGwch0U">This parody</a> is only slightly helpful.  It’s “Friday” recomposed, with lyrics as interpreted by a lip reader.  It’s hilarious, but beware: the parody lyrics and original music will collide in your mind and you’ll go even more bat-crazy, but in a fun way. </p>
<p>There is a bright side, though, and it’s this:</p>
<div class="embed-hulu"><iframe width="640" height="370" src="http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=zg3t9oWyfsj8-ZSvacfPlA" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen> </iframe></div>
<p>It’s probably the best thing to happen to this ridiculous song.  </p>
<p>I’d like to note that I do not intend to bash Rebecca Black.  I’m sure she’s a lovely girl who’s too young to be solely responsible for how terrible this song/video turned out.  Also, I’m sorry, <em>Idler</em> readers, if my deconstruction has made “Friday” all the more enticing and irresistible.  Some things are just too wretched to bear alone.</p>
