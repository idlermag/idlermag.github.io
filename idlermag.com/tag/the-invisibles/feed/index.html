										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So that’s that. Time to pack on up and get on out of this universe. </p>
<p>Today’s date &#8212; December 21, 2012 &#8212; has long been the source of much consternation for conspiracy theorists of all manners, driving scientists, writers and artists of all types to support or disprove the armageddon it supposedly brings in its celestial importance. For some, unique planetary alignment, interpretations of the ancient Mayan calendar, and random support found in both the works of Nostradamus and the Torah all suggest that a great shift is about to occur &#8212; on this, the day to end all days.</p>
<p>Well, as you may have guessed, I prefer to get my deep philosophical understanding of worldwide collapse and rebirth from comic books. </p>
<p>As I described <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/12/06/the-truth-is-in-here/">previously</a>, <em>The Invisibles</em> stands as one of Grant Morrison’s most compelling and complex bodies of work, not the least for its tightly woven vision of the countdown to the end of the world. For much of its narrative, the eponymous heroes of the series work against their opposite number, the Outer Church, to free humanity from the shackles of fear and loathing. In the end, however, we come to discover the battle was not nearly as black and white as it seemed. Ultimately, both sides of the embattled coin were working toward the same goal: the end of consciousness and identity as we know it on December 22, 2012. This is the morning after our last great night out on the town, except that instead of a cosmic hangover, we get to experience nirvana or heaven or, as Morrison describes it, the Supercontext.</p>

<p>One of Morrison’s most important theories about the nature of the universe, the Supercontext is the world as it was always meant to be &#8212; a four dimensional state of complete unity between creation and its inhabitants. Individualism is both eliminated and multiplied, as we are simultaneously all connected through time and genetics back to the first protozoan lifeform, a single organism with infinite aspects, faces and branches through which any identity we desire can be expressed. Want to be a rock god? A killer revolutionary? A public school teacher? In the Supercontext, it’s all there for the taking. And when you’re bored with one identity, one can just shed his or her fiction suit and put on another.</p>
<p>Our world, as we experience it today (but no longer tomorrow!), is the result of the crossing between creator and creation &#8212; the download of a higher dimensional being into our flimsy three through the rift in reality caused by the release of the first atom bomb. Like an obscene liquid pouring into a container not fit to hold its contents, this magic mirror refracts back a broken universe of conflict and overlap between good and evil, health and disease &#8212; invisibility and desolation. Our world, in this moment, retroactively became the very struggle <em>The Invisibles</em> purports to describe, but the mistake we all make is believing it is a battle between ideology and not, simply, a labored movement back toward our true point of origin. We are living in reverse with time speeding up every second (can’t you feel it?), moving closer and closer to our own birth back into the Supercontext. And tomorrow, if all goes to plan, is when the cord will finally be cut. </p>

<p>The obvious comparisons to the act of creation, particularly that of a comic book, are of course no accident. Morrison depicts a world where characters can step outside of panels, move between moments &#8212; folding time as if it were simply paper to be manipulated, drawn upon, and then erased and redrawn. Words are weapons for both sides of the war between the Invisibles and their mirrored foes, and like Oppenheimer’s grand pronouncement, they have a way of becoming real the moment they are uttered. As the series reaches its glorious conclusion, some 60 issues and 3 volumes later, the final confrontation between the two opposing forces comes down not to violence, but to language itself. Dosed with an upgraded version of a drug once given to King Mob during a near death-inducing interrogation by the Outer Church, the King Archon experiences the mad effects of Key 64 &#8212; the psychedelic literalization of the printed word. POP goes the symbol of all that is oppressive in our universe, a new era ushered in through words and emotion rather than violence and physicality. Because of this shift, and as if to signal we’re ready for the next step in our evolution, BARBELiTH &#8212; placenta to the Supercontext &#8212; finally bursts to signal our readiness for rebirth.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10872" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/12/21/the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it/invisibles2_3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/invisibles2_3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,987" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Invisibles2_3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/invisibles2_3.jpg?w=195" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/invisibles2_3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/invisibles2_3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=987" alt="logoplasm" width="640" height="987" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10872" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/invisibles2_3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/invisibles2_3.jpg?w=97&amp;h=150 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/invisibles2_3.jpg?w=195&amp;h=300 195w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The mysterious giant red satellite hovering just beyond the dark side of the moon, BARBELiTH is frequent meme throughout the run of the series, appearing first as graffiti on the wall during a psychotropic Invisible initiation ritual. At once placenta, a model of the true nature of the holographic universe (in that all sides are indeed the same), and a great cosmic stoplight, BARBELiTH is that which nurtures humanity in its dreams, appearing most frequently following a severely traumatic experience. Alien abduction, shamanic activity, and near death experience are all different interpretations of our brush with the oncoming Supercontext, and Morrison’s great red dot &#8212; this period on the end of the universe we know &#8212; is there to prepare us most fully. In fact, it is only the moment when man reaches out to touch BARBELiTH, moves beyond its normal conception of space by sending a N.A.S.A. contingent to greet it, that the world experiences its second gushing rift in reality. This time, however, the break is motivated by love, not war. And thus it seems we are prepared for the apocalypse after all.</p>
<p>Would that I believed our world had reached this place on Morrison’s timetable, but with mere hours left to go before sunrise on December 22, I fear we’ve not quite made it yet. Humanity, as we’ve seen over the course of the last week, month, year, and decade, is definitely changing, and I believe (I truly do) evolving for the better. But just not fast enough. </p>
<p><em>The Invisibles</em> has meant many things to me over the years, and it’s one of those rare pieces of literature that shift ever so slightly with every reading, moving us and it toward greater understanding with every page turn. It demands to be revisited, quite literally, asking that we rinse and repeat until we get it right. And we haven’t gotten it right yet. We’re still serving out our time in a hologram of selfishness and pain, constrained by three dimensions and only pretending to understand what lies beyond. It’s time for us to start rewriting our story, to stop letting the illusion of contradictory forces distract us from our greater purpose. We need to embrace our place as part of grand unified theory &#8212; not of physics but of psyche. It’s time to relinquish an either/or mentality and embrace a universe turned inside-out &#8212; to identify with unity over ego and grow into something better, that which we were always meant to be.</p>
<p>So, are you ready for what comes next? Because wouldn’t you rather our world end not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a cheer?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everybody loves a good conspiracy theory. Books, movies, and television are chock full of fictional and non-fictional attempts to make sense of the world &#8212; not with the simplest of explanations, but in the most interesting way possible. We want all dots to connect, even if matching point A to point B is frightening, because a world without a master plan is a much more chaotic place to live. It’s too easy to lose one’s sense of self in a sea of random occurrence and unrelated happenstance. The comfort derived from knowing that it all (finally!) makes sense is pretty compelling, after all.</p>
<p>Therefore, I subscribe to as many conspiracy theories as possible &#8212; not with any seriousness of course, but I find it makes our world a much more fascinating place to inhabit. I’m not particularly troubled by the tracking device that was injected with my first measles vaccine, particularly now that I carry a smartphone with me everywhere I go. If they want to find me, I say have at it. I’ll likely be at work. Or at home. Or at a comic book shop. Thrilling. I frequently see individuals on the train or walking down the street who look oddly familiar, like younger or older versions of friends or acquaintances. Merely coincidence, or do the past, present and future all exist simultaneously in our three-dimensional space? Tough call, but I like the road upon which this line of questioning travels.</p>
<p>But what if every conspiracy, every crazy idea ever to grace the pages of the <em>Weekly World News</em>, was actually true? What if the deepest and darkest secrets you’ve only heard whispered about in dreams are happening behind the closed doors of the highest offices in the land? What if they really are out to get you? Then you’re experiencing something like <em>The Invisibles</em>.</p>
<p>Originally published in three volumes from 1995 to 2000 from the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics &#8212; and now available in one complete omnibus edition &#8212; <em>The Invisibles</em> is the brainchild of writer Grant Morrison, and perhaps one of his finest and most complete works to date. For centuries, the Invisible College has worked in secret to combat forces that would see humanity enslaved through physical and psychic means. Their foes are the Archons of the Outer Church, extra-dimensional beings whose only desire is complete and utter control of the minds and heart of the human race. The Invisibles will use any means at their disposal &#8212; magic, time travel, psychic projection, guns &#8212; to free us and ensure our elevation to the next level of existence. As we tread quickly towards the end of the world we know and the beginning of the next, the Invisibles are always there, working in the shadows to prevent our complete and utter oppression. And where the Invisibles are, their opponents are not far behind.</p>

<p>Morrison weaves an enormous tapestry with this series, tying historical data with the wildest of conspiracy theories imaginable. No stone remains unturned in this series, as everything from alien abduction to the Marquis de Sade is laid out on the table for inspection. The world the Invisibles inhabit is certainly complicated, at times mind-boggling in its detail and contradiction, but at the same time refreshingly strident in its convictions. There is an intrinsic good and bad in the universe, or so we believe at first glance. But the deeper into this dark world we go &#8212; past the flash of a gun barrel and beyond the elegant gore of the enemy’s cloaked face &#8212; the more smoke is created in this massive conflagration. We’re never truly sure who the real enemy is, and how insidious their reach is within the very characters we come to root for. Is there really an Outer Church, or is that simply the backside of the Invisible College itself &#8212; two sides of the same coin &#8212; hurdling ever more decisively towards December 22, 2012, the morning after our supposed armageddon? This dilemma only gets more confounding as we read this narrative in a post-9/11 era, where terrorism, no matter what the cause, elicits a distinct knee-jerk reaction of antipathy. Where does the line fall between the fight for freedom and a spread of terror? Even the characters themselves rarely have the answer.</p>

<p>Broken down into potentially hundreds of cells, with relatively little communication amongst them, these Invisibles represent the height of Enlightenment individualism and opposition to societal abuses. Every cell consists of five members, exemplifying the core aspects of the metaphysical world &#8212; air, fire, water, earth and spirit. For most of the series, we follow a single British invisible cell, only getting peeks of and guest visits from other freedom fighters around the globe. At the center of the action is King Mob, a mystery novelist turned James Bond, and most commonly thought of as a direct representation of the author himself (He even takes on the nom de guerre of “Kirk Morrison” when interrogated ruthlessly by the enemy.). Mob is the spine upon which all three volumes and their characters attach themselves, and we’re treated to the inside of his head far more than almost any other figure. That said, there is an intense physicality to King Mob that drives much of the action, from his advanced martial arts training and bloody gun-fighting to his intense lovemaking with fellow Invisible Ragged Robin. Even his spirit form, sent back to the 1920s to unravel alchemical secrets, manages to copulate so furiously as to set a magical severed hand into five-dimensional motion. And as King Mob gets most out of control and unfocused, so too goes the team, spinning towards madness.</p>

<p>It’s difficult not to empathize with protagonists that want to free the world from endless submission, no matter what their means, particularly ones surrounded by such fascinating personal history. Lord Fanny, a Brazilian trans woman shaman, is truly a light throughout the series, exhibiting adept prowess at magic and psychic ability, not to mention a sharp tongue and even sharper sense of fashion. Lucille Butler, the conflicted operative known as Boy, was once part of the establishment herself, a New York City police officer whose brother disappeared after boarding a black train to one of the United States’ 23 secret concentration camps for dissidents. A troubled lad from Liverpool, Jack Frost is destined to be the new Buddha &#8212; the new age messiah who will ultimately usher mankind into its next state of being. His path towards enlightenment is both bloody and introspective, and he more than any other character represents doubt. Is any of this really happening, and if it is, what chance does humankind really have?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the ill-fated, time lost Ragged Robin is above all closest to my heart. Star of the deeply compelling second series, Robin is illustrated magnificently by that volume’s primary artist Phil Jimenez. While the work of many exemplary pencillers grace the pages of this enormous tome &#8212; including Jill Thompson, Chris Weston, and Steve Yowell &#8212; Jimenez’s crisp line and attention to detail serve Morrison’s story best of all, lending a sense of realism to an otherwise chaotic set of circumstances. His Robin, newly appointed leader and still a mystery to her comrades, is an exceptional beauty clad in a warrior’s garb of black leather and fishnet stockings, with sharply curved eyebrows just reaching around the edges of her Raggedy Ann-inspired face paint. It is through Robin that we come to understand much of Morrison’s grander plan, as time speeds up towards both the end of the world we know and the coronation of a new British king &#8212; an Archon who would bring about the utter devastation of the human spirit at the turn of the year 2000. </p>

<p>Truthfully, the sheer breadth of ideas Morrison spreads on this canvas is too overwhelming to take in on a single read &#8212; or a single analysis. Having read this story of relentless domination and heroic destruction more than a half dozen times, I’ve only begun to crack the seal on Morrison’s true genius.  Morrison’s initial intention for <em>The Invisibles</em> was that it function as a hypersigil, a magical focal point for jumpstarting intellectual freedom in the years leading up to and beyond the millennium. Indeed, that magic permeates every page, reflecting Morrison’s own experience (legend tells of his own abduction by aliens, mirroring that which he wrote) and refracting it outwards towards the reader’s internal life as well. Beyond the mad conspiracy and shades of ultra-violence rests a story of genuine hope through perseverance and honor among compatriots. One needn’t believe every word of what Morrison writes to get to the core of the story &#8212; you only need to believe in the power of man, armed against overwhelming darkness, to experience a great appreciation for the battle he lays out before you on the page. And frankly, the conspiracy doesn’t need you to believe in it anyway. It’s going to get to you either way. Of that we can be certain.</p>
