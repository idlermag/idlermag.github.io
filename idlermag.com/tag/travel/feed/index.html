										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>April 9, 2009</strong></p>
<p>I’m unsettled. I’ve never traveled for work before, but I like that it’s a thing &#8212; “traveling for work.”</p>
<p>“Do you get to do any traveling?” people ask when you tell them you’re considering a job. </p>
<p>“Two or three times a year,” in this case.</p>
<p>“That’s great!” they respond, as if it’s somehow a <em>de facto</em> vacation. </p>
<p>I suppose it is in some ways, but mostly I feel the weighty responsibility to be the sole representative for my company while speaking with customers, and to avoid overspending my per diem. I also feel like it’s my job not to get swallowed up by this city with which I am absolutely unfamiliar. </p>
<p>Well, that’s not entirely true. </p>
<p>I am familiar with Washington, D.C., but not from any practical experience. I just lived here (virtually) for about two hundred hours in <em>Fallout 3</em>.</p>
<p>Of one thing I’m certain: I was completely unprepared to ride the escalator out of the metro station this morning. As I made the long and steep ascent, that distinctive concrete ceiling curving all the way around me, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end. I used to think that was just an expression, but I actually reached back there and felt the little downy buggers standing at attention. Then Ron Perlman’s voice intoned somewhere inside the back of my head: “War. War never changes.”</p>
<p>So, UNSETTLED. I am it.</p>

<p><strong>April 10, 2009</strong></p>
<p>The conference I’m attending hasn’t been too busy, which is fine by me, since I’m pretty much flying by the seat of my pants over here. Fortunately I speak fluent Shakespeare Geek, so even if I can’t answer an academic’s question about the varying introductions to different editions, I can at least end the conversation with a genial quote-off.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to venture too far out for lunch, since I’m the only one working the booth. D.C. favorite Five Guys Burgers and Fries is near the conference hotel. The Washington Post says they’re the “Willie Wonkas of burgercraft,” so I thought I’d give it a shot.</p>
<p>Side note: who spells “Willy Wonka” incorrectly? Where was your childhood, o nameless journalist? Know you not Roald Dahl? Gene Wilder? Have you eaten nary a Nerd?!</p>
<p>On the way to lunch today I saw a dog tied up outside a Chinatown gift shop. I’m not sure what breed it was. Some kind of smallish terrier, I think. No blue heeler, to be sure, but I couldn’t help thinking of my beloved Dogmeat from <em>Fallout 3</em>. It was definitely friendly, so I gave it a pat on the head and almost involuntarily said, “You know, I think you&#8217;re the first dog I&#8217;ve met that didn&#8217;t try to eat me.”</p>
<p>Once again I got the neck hair prickles. Once again I ruminated over the popular idea that video games aren’t able to affect us as deeply as other art forms, and furthermore, won’t ever be able to do so. </p>
<p>I am unconvinced.</p>
<p>On the way back from the burger joint, the dog was still outside the shop, lounging in a patch of sidewalk sun. I still had half a brown sack of fries because seriously, they give you way too many. The dog lifted its head at my approach. Maybe it was because of the earlier head pat, but I had a feeling it had more to do with the aroma of the peanut oil fried potatoes in my possession. In a different (virtual) time and different (virtual) place, this might have been my chance to gain a permanent companion. So I slipped it a fry. </p>
<p>So sorry anonymous dog parent, but the cat will mew, and dog will have his day!</p>

<p><strong>April 11, 2009</strong></p>
<p>Today was the last day of the conference. Farewell, English professor who lurked around my booth the whole time! You had a face as gaunt as Charon’s with a personality to match. That is to say, I liked you.</p>
<p>I scheduled an evening train back to New York, but the conference exhibits closed at 12:30, so that means someone got the whole afternoon to herself. I knew exactly what to do. I popped in the earbuds to my iPod, queued up my Galaxy News Radio playlist, and headed out to the National Mall. Why fight it? I’m finding my way around D.C. via my intimate knowledge of a video game. True story.</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed to find traveling from The Capitol Building to the Lincoln Memorial took about a hundred years longer than it took me in-game. Not to mention I don’t have anywhere near the endurance of my avatar. Can you imagine what kind of great shape you’d be in, carrying 150+ pounds of wasteland crap around at any given time? I didn’t mind the long walk, though. Time flies when you’ve got The Ink Spots’ “Maybe” in your ear.</p>
<p>I was pleased to see the Museum of American History and Museum of Technology (er, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum) were exactly where I left them, and in better condition, to boot! </p>
<p>By the time I reached the Washington Monument and Danny Kaye was refusing to leave the Congo, a woman stopped me to ask for directions. Wearing iPod earbuds is apparently a sign for “I know where I’m going,” even in D.C. It means the same thing in New York, but there I like to pretend it really means “leave me the hell alone.” I was happy to oblige this woman’s request, though. It was a beautiful day in the Capital Wasteland.</p>
<p>“Do you know the way to the Lincoln Memorial?” she queried.</p>
<p>“It’s a straight shot thataway,” I pointed west. “But don’t go straight down the middle. I mean, unless you want the experience.”</p>
<p>She laughed because she thought I was making a joke about wading through the reflecting pool. I smiled because I knew it really was about leveling up. And super mutants.</p>
<p><em>That’s right, lady</em>, I thought, <em>I’m the Lone Wanderer, and this is real life.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m from Las Cruces, New Mexico, a city populated by around 99,000 people where you can somehow still run into everyone you know at the Super Walmart on Valley Drive and Avenida de Mesilla. It’s the kind of place where high school sports rivalries are king, where teenagers huddle down into a dusty ditch bank and drink watered down beer while fields of cotton grow dry and wooly and the sun bakes the ground into a crack-fissured clay. The weather forecast forms a bingo board of little yellow sunshines, disturbed every once in a good while by thunderous storms that pour in fresh wet stripes punctuated with whipcrack flashes of lightning. </p>
<p>People there talk in funny accents &#8212; a marriage of cool, laid-back, Californian English and dramatically elongated Spanish syllables. One “gets down” from the car to go into the store, and carries the onus of a silly nickname like a mythological birthright. The food is fat with flavor, the culture, thick with artists. Stay long enough and a slow and sleepy boredom seeps deep into your bones, not a boredom that irritates so much as builds a gravity that keeps you in one place, makes you stay &#8212; warm, dream-heavy, happy. When choosing a grad school, I picked faraway places on the map fearing the lotus-eater lull of my beautiful home and an almost genetic tendency toward petrified paralysis. I’ve been working through the cold perspective of living in East Lansing, Michigan for about 10 years, now.</p>
<p>I’d never been to Boston, Massachusetts until a few weeks ago. Everything I knew of the place was a small collage of colonial history, Celtics basketball, the regulars of the downstairs bar, <em>Cheers</em>, and some dramatic scenes from <em>Good Will Hunting</em>. (“I gawt huh numbuh&#8211;how bout them ah-pples?”) Representing the non-fiction journal I work for at MSU, I attended a conference for the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) in a complex hamster cage of a hotel conference center/shopping mall in downtown Boston. Imagine thousands of writers anxiously milling about in their scarves and wryly chosen spectacles. Aisle after aisle of booths, books, authors, publishers, editors. In some ways I felt completely at home. Not geographically, per se, but in my seat of comfort and power; I was in a place where my love for literature and language could find friendship and revel in nerdy delights. In other ways I felt completely lost and alienated. Amidst the movement, the clouds of chatter, the thousands of people just like me, I could at times feel dull, null, nil. </p>
<p>The snow outside was falling sideways in wet messy sheets. The streets were puddled with thick ice water ponds much deeper than my sneakered toe could dip. Inside, the conference hummed with body heat and dizzying distraction, the intermingling exhalations of too many mouths.</p>
<p>Making my way through the labyrinthine levels and turns, past the conference center, the Starbucks, the Coach store, beyond the reach of Armani, Louis Vuitton, the kiosks at the mall, down the escalator and across a hidden underpass below the exposed snowy street above, I bought a ticket on the train and booked it to Harvard. Nervous and alone I watched the stops on the map too closely. I focused tightly on the colored lines, the dots for each station, as Boston people populated and detrained the car with an easy indifference.</p>
<p>After trudging through slick muck in Harvard Square for at least twenty minutes, I was cold, lost, and spent, but I found the tattoo shop, finally. My friend’s brother, Sky, was my artist. He’s from my hometown, but I’d never met him. And here we were, together, two desert kids in Massachusetts telling stories of sun, Spanish art, the power of tamales and cholo style. And he was quiet, funny, smart, thoughtful, with a tiny Zia symbol etched behind his ear. A teacher, a maker, an avid Netflixer, much like myself. And he carved a red heart into my forearm, needled in colors of New Mexico sunsets onto the banner, marked my love of TV (with equal parts wink and sincerity) into the geography of my body. When the pain burned hotter and my eyes would roll back away from the whirring, Dia de los Muertos and retablo inspired pieces settled my gaze. We talked about loving a place, our home, and how we could never really go back. Our stories overlapping with the colors he was stitching. Intersecting lines and routes. Mappings. Intersecting lines and roots. </p>
<p>No longer lost, I made my way back to the dirty subway platform, still concrete and grey, still alien, but a little less scary, a little more known. Cold, tired, surrounded by strangers, I carried my new gift home. My heart throbbing in my coat sleeve, hidden, secret, and mine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as a nonfiction writer, I’ve already managed to lie to you before I even start. Quit cooking, start reading is not quite true &#8212; I pretty much never stop reading. Not to eat, brush my teeth, not even when cleaning the kitchen or taking a walk. I read my way through the winter hibernation and through the summer vacations. Whenever I fly, I carry 2-3 books on the plane with me because I’m too cheap for an e-reader and because I’m likely to get through at least two. The back problems are totally worth it.</p>
<p>One of my professors sent me the reading list for my fall literature class ahead of time so that we can go ahead and get started. A cooler person than me might have been dismayed, but it made me thrilled to start school. Partly, I was psyched because I’d already read some of the things on the list, which made me feel educated as hell. And that meant I could reread them, actually remember them, and maybe think of some smart shit to say ahead of time in class. (But not too many smart things &#8212; no one wants to be THAT girl, and I don’t want to be shunned at the after-class happy hour.) I’ve already started rereading Nabokov’s <em>Lolita</em>, and have been keeping a list of the beautiful and inventive language he uses so that I can try to learn something while I limp along in my novicehood.</p>
<p>For example: “. . . a poplar playing its liquid shadows all over the local Honor Roll” (p. 137); the backyard with “apple-green light” (p. 31); Lolita with “all four limbs starfished” across the chair (p. 174). Oh dear, I got too Englishy. But if you can’t appreciate the gorgeous prose, then I probably can’t appreciate you. I’m also excited to reread Raymond Carver’s short stories “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love” and “Beginners.”</p>
<p>I expect to probably be cooking much less when I’m in school, and writing to you about the best ways to jazz up rice and beans, writing a treatise on the various forms of caffeine, or on the best way to discreetly drink wine during workshop. But before I do all of that, I’m headed back to Michigan with my dad’s side of the family and Charlie to go up north to one of my most favorite places.</p>

<p>We all spend a ton of time reading up there, moving from the hammock to the dock, to the pontoon, to a lawn chair, and back to the hammock again. My dad reads exactly one book a year. He always reads it up north, and it’s always about music. Last year I let him borrow my copy of Steve Almond’s book <em>Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life</em>, with its companion playlist. The year before that, he read Keith Richards’s <em>Life</em>, and read aloud anecdotes about prostitutes and drug cocktails. The year before that, it was Alice Cooper’s book <em>Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roller&#8217;s 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict</em> (which is actually pretty hilarious).</p>
<p>For me, I found a used book at the lovely <a href="http://www.greenapplebooks.com/" target="_blank">Green Apple Books</a> called <em>Not for Bread Alone: Writers on Food, Wine, and the Art of Eating</em>, edited by Daniel Halpern. It’s a collection of food writing from well-known writers, including Wendell Berry, Charles Simic, Joyce Carol Oates, and Francine Prose, among others. Before I get started with classes and get buried under class readings, I’m bringing that one up north, along with Julia Child’s <em>My Life in France</em>, which was given to me as a gift and I MUST READ before I lose all steam.</p>
<p>Reading while lying in the sun and/or eating is one of the things I enjoy most. I wish you all a happy summer, and happy reading!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wonder what is like being from another country. This sounds sort of stupid, but Americans often have a strange, warped view of the music of other countries. It is not unexpected to have a country-specific oritentation towards your own pop culture. We are the center of our experience and of our own perspective. In music, we are aware of the music originating in other countries, but it ebbs and flows. In the 90s the pendulum was the alt.rock movement coming from Seattle and other spots. Then the pendulum swung towards the UK with Oasis and Britpop. But what would the 90s have been like in other countries? Just how dominant is the American music scene in other countries? How did the music coming from the USA play in these countries during musical boom times and musical bust times? What happens when the pendulum swings in the opposite direction?</p>
<p>England may not the best example, since the UK has produced so much of our popular music in the past 50 years. Let’s think about other English-speaking countries like Canada and Australia. Have you ever tried to watch the Juno awards on CBC and felt that even without a language barrier that you may as well have been watching a program on how to learn Morse code? A quick trawl through the record books shows an unmatched FIVE YEAR WINNING STREAK FOR BRYAN ADAMS. On the female side, Anne Murray and Celine Dion have four-year streaks. The Tragically Hip, a quintessentially Canadian band, have won multiple Juno awards. </p>
<p>The Aria awards, from Australia, can feel equally as disjointed. The Hall of Fame class of 2011 consisted of Kylie Minogue and the Wiggles. Yes. The Wiggles, torturers of parents for over a decade. Yet a swirl through the award winners does not always yield a wacky result. For in 1998 the Aria Album of the Year was <em>Unit</em> by the Brisbane band, Regurgitator. Never heard of them? Of course not! But I have, and let me tell you, they’re great.</p>
<p>In 1998 I spent some time participating in an overseas study program through Michigan State University. I spent time in Australia, folks, Sydney and Canberra to be more precise. Now you would not know this from looking at me but I LOVE Australia and have for thirty years. (Is that possible? When did I first learn of Australia? Let’s see. . . Superman 2 on HBO, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor wanting beachfront property, globe spins to. . . Australi. New Year&#8217;s Day 1982. Yep, thirty years) Once I got over my initial cowardice and signed up for the program, I departed from Detroit in early January of 1998.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9269" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/23/regurgitated/unit/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Unit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=640" alt="Unit" title="Unit"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-9269" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Once in Australia, I heard bits and bobs about this band from Brisbane. The HMV store I lived at in Sydney had the CD on display, a silver cover with a great yellow circle on the front. Yet I didn’t buy it. When our group arrived in Canberra I remember talking with an Australian girl about the band, “the Gurge” she called them. I was really trying to chat her up when my attention was distracted by a ditz with big brown eyes (look it up) and when I turned around the Aussie was gone. But her words on the band stuck with me. I bought a Rolling Stone with the band on the cover and read up on them before really digging into their catalog. It took my return to the states before I got a chance to buy <em>Unit</em>. Actually, I came into work one day and there was in my locker. I had no idea my manager ordered it for me from the import sheets, and it was such a wonderful shock. I bought the disc and took it home to listen to it.</p>
<p>The disc opens with the song, “I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff.” You need to know the first LP, <em>Tu Plang</em>, to understand that opening song. On their first CD the band is very rockish, muscular and melodic, with lots of crash and <em>sturm und drang</em>. The humor is evident (&#8220;I Sucked A Lot of Cock To Get Where I Am&#8221;) as are the band’s interest in different sounds (&#8220;G7 Dick Electric Boogie&#8221;). Hearing those songs and then this first song, you come to an understanding that the band is branching into a new direction, one that may not be well received. But then on &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; the band is just a ripping motor of super fast, super fun music. Two songs in and <em>Unit</em> is only about 6 minutes long and just tons of fun. Then you get to the third song, called “! (The Song Formerly Known As)&#8221; which is a killer. Sort of like a hybrid Prince song, catchy and rocking and vibrant. In these songs you hear the sounds that were being planted on that first disc and watching them bloom is very exciting. The disc was strong in 1998 and while it isn’t quite as strong in 2012, the tracks that stood out still stand out. &#8220;Bubble Boy&#8221; is the second greatest song about an inflatable sex doll, only trailing Roxy Music’s &#8220;In Every Dream Home A Heartache&#8221; on that sparsely inhabited trail.</p>
<p>The not-yet-extinct music video helped the band with their image and the videos from the <em>Unit</em> LP are as strong as the songs. &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; acts out the plot to <em>Tron</em>, while “!” shows the band standing around in Japanese crowds.  Other videos are computer animated and silly and disposable but somehow entertaining and engaging as well.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9270" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/23/regurgitated/art1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Art1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=640" alt=". . . Art" title="Art1"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-9270" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> There are a few themes that pop up on <em>Unit</em> that make their way into Regurgitator’s follow-up CD, <em>. . . Art</em>, most notably a sense of disconnection from humanity and the embrace of technology as a substitute for traditional human interaction. These themes are sometimes subtle, sometimes not. Even on their poppiest of songs, and man oh man does <em>. . . Art</em> have some poppy songs, there is a bittersweet underpinning to every lyric. On &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; from <em>Unit</em>, Quan Yeomans sings “everyday I talk to my machines/more sense than talking with human beings.” This disconnect, the withdrawal into the virtual doesn’t sound too far-fetched today but in 1998 could it have seemed real? The last song on <em>. . . Art</em> is titled &#8220;Virtual Life&#8221; and the words are about needing everything from the TV screen and needing nothing else from a regular life. As a man who spends too much time on Facebook, this song feels prophetic. We surrender so much of ourselves to exist online.</p>
<p>When I was in Australia I noticed a sign in the classrooms on my second day in the country: a sign beckoning students to turn off their cell phones. Back home, cell phones were car phones and were the size of a foot. They weren’t everywhere and they certainly weren’t “your phone.” In some ways it feels strange that one of the most removed continents, hell, THE most removed continent on the globe would be so quick to adapt to new technology. At the same time, with that early adaption, perhaps that is where the burnout so aptly described on these songs originates. In the late 90s there was so much of an undercurrent of chatter speaking to “pre-millennium tension” but without any substance or understanding of where that tension originated from. Here, in Australia, was a band that was singing out about a different type of tension between technology and human connection, which has grown and overgrown the globe in the 14 years since the words were put to tape.</p>
<p>When I listen to <em>Unit</em> and <em>. . . Art</em>, I am magically whisked away from here to another land and another time. As with any nostalgia, some of the memories hold up, some don’t. The tracks on these two LPs, however, hold up in all their poppy greatness. I see that the band continues to record and release music. I’m glad for that as we are all better off with a band like Regurgitator in the world. Humor, discontent, observation and melody. What more do you need?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I travelled to Chicago to attend a writers’ conference, AWP. AWP is the Association of Writers and Writing Programs. They have a yearly conference in late February where all of the people who belong to AWP, or programs that are associated with AWP, can get together. We attend panels about writing, go to off-site poetry readings, meet online friends face to face, gather information about grad schools, and escape from our real lives for four glorious days.</p>
<p>This year brought home about 10 pounds of journals, two fancy bags, and a head cold that I’m still getting over. I was supposed to bring home new contacts and a connection to an agent. But I panicked.</p>
<p>Last year the conference was in Washington, DC. I went to interesting panels and talked with people in elevators and at the book fair. I even asked a couple questions at the panels. I tweeted and laughed and bonded with complete strangers over the experience of spending four days in a new city discussing writing and literature.  Not so in Chicago.</p>
<p>I rode the train to the Windy City and in the Amtrak station other people were talking about what they would do at the conference. I thought about saying I was going too, but these people were talking to friends and I was a creepy eavesdropper. I stayed mute.</p>
<p>The muteness followed me to Chicago. I wanted to talk to people at the panels. In the more crowded ones we were pretty much on top of each other, with people sitting on the floors at a couple. But all I could think was that the person next to me was taking hardly any notes. This particular panel was about how the panelists, editors at various journals, had changed their writing style after gaining experience editing other people’s work. I took copious notes. The lady to my left wrote down the panelists’ names and then nothing. I wanted to tell her to give her chair to a floor person who would benefit from a comfortable position in which to take notes.</p>
<p>Then the floor people started asking stupid questions and I gave up hope of helping them. They kept asking the speakers to stand up when they were talking so they could be seen. None of the panelists wanted to, you could see it in their eyes. I’m pretty sure one panelist &#8212; I’ll omit names in case I’m reading into things &#8212; rolled her eyes at the people in the front row. Standing was awkward and they had to pass around one mic instead of using the convenient tabletop mics the hotel had provided. I was irritated and I knew I was being a bit irrational but that rarely stops me.</p>
<p>In DC I made arrangements to have lunch with fellow Idler Jill Kolongowski a few days before I left. We knew each other from college and I wanted to see her again to kind of cement our quasi-friendship. We met, hugged, and ate Italian food. Her gnocchi looked amazing but I didn’t know her well enough to ask for a bite. This year, after growing closer online, I didn’t set up a time to meet with her at all. We happened to run into each other at the book fair after I spent days thinking I should have tried to find her but not doing anything about it. I was broken.</p>
<p>And I was hating people. There was the lady sitting next to me at a very not crowded panel who kept looking over my shoulder and writing down something every time I wrote down something. There were multiple panels where there weren’t enough handouts to go around. Generally, I’m an excellent note taker and prefer to write down what I’m interested in as opposed to having someone tell me what’s most important. But when there were handouts and they ran out, suddenly I wanted one. I needed one! Now there would be hard to spell author last names and bullet points and a bevy of information I wouldn’t be able to access just because someone miscalculated the popularity of learning the best ways to introduce the element of surprise in short stories. I had seen a gentleman in my “Beyond Pulp – The Futuristic and Fantastic as Literary Fiction” get up and chase down the handout he wanted. I was <em>not</em> going to be that guy. Heaven forbid I embarrass myself in front of a room of people I’d never see again.</p>
<p>At one panel the two women in front of me struck up a conversation and ended up sharing email addresses and Twitter names before the panel even started. I wondered what they were talking about. I think I heard mention of <em>Sherlock</em> and wanted to join in, but didn’t. How do you just turn to a stranger and find out something you have in common? I texted this question to my friend back home because obviously the best way to make contacts at a conference is to have your nose in your cell phone.</p>
<p>One lady was knitting during the panel I was excited about the most. Knitting. She was already there when I found my seat; I got in as soon as the room cleared. I assumed she had attended the previous panel and was just killing time before the next one started. But she didn’t stop knitting when they started talking. She was all “knit, purl, knit, purl” oblivious to her surroundings. The five young women on the panel had put time and effort into research about how to make money while writing and this person was crafting during their talk. Halfway through she seemed to remember where she was and packed up her needles. Instead of politely listening she got up and walked out.</p>
<p>By the end of the week I was exhausted. I wandered aimlessly through the book fair, tried to talk to the people manning the booths but my sentences weren’t coming out as planned. I left early due to overstimulation and hid in my hotel room.</p>
<p>Why was my Chicago experience so different from DC? I know not everyone judges me as harshly as I judge them. I know I can talk to strangers and come out the other end unscathed. And I know I’m not the only one with these worries. I definitely wasn’t the only one glaring at the knitting lady or laughing silently at the guy chasing down a silly handout. Many of the attendees are like me, quiet in large groups, expressing themselves through blogging instead of talking, planning out exactly what to say in any situation that could possibly arise at a 10,000 person conference.</p>
<p>Many of the attendees pushed through these worries and got stuff done anyway. They tweeted that they were wearing purple zebra print tights and to say hello if you saw them at the book fair. They bonded over walking twelve blocks through wind and snow. Most of us let go of our fears and said hello to an author whose books are well worn on our shelves back home. A writing conference may seem a little ironic since we are often loners, but we love each other. We get each other. And even if one of us is broken and walking alone down the street, another writer will strike up a conversation and give a girl like me great advice on how to write a short story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I’m flying to the Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP) Conference in Chicago (a conference for writers, teachers, and book nerds of all varieties). It’s the first year I don’t have to sit at a table and force flyers into writers’ unwilling hands or present a paper that I’m only 20% sure is legitimate. I’m free to carry a flask (even if I fill it with water and only pretend it’s gin), wake up whenever I want, and be only marginally cooperative. I’m going to AWP to see old friends, meet people in real life that I’ve only ever met on the internet, maybe go to some panels and readings, and schmooze. Well, in my head I’m schmoozing; in reality I’m standing in the corner staring at someone important while I try to get the courage to go up and talk to him, and he walks away before I can make up my mind. I will not be eating.</p>
<p>Normally, eating is the highest of my priorities. Sometimes it’s even above getting dressed properly. I always eat three meals a day. If I don’t, my sugar level crashes and I become a monster whose superpower is whining and complaining about migraines, intent only on eating but also unable to decide what she wants or how to get it. My days are planned so that this monster stays penned up in her cage. But at AWP, it’s feast or famine. All my normal eating habits go straight out the window. I eat like a 10-year-old child left without a babysitter. My brain is too scrambled from the simultaneous presence of great writers and fear of looking like an idiot.</p>

Even though I made sure my face looks good, I keep head down to avoid eye contact. Pretend like I’m not a tourist like the twenty other conference-goers in line. I order a bagel. They are out of all but onion bagels. I order an oatmeal. They will somehow forget my order and I have to order again. Now I’m starting to run out of time to make it to the first panel. On the way out the door, I realize I’ve made no plan where to actually <em>eat</em> the oatmeal. I try to eat it while I walk, but the steam from the oatmeal fogs up my glasses and I can’t see. I drop the spoon on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Once I’m in the conference hotel, I sit in a corner behind a stray table and bend the oatmeal lid to use as a spoon. I hope no one can see me but of course someone I know will come up to say hello. I’ll have to hoist myself up from the ground to hug her. I will get oatmeal on her coat. I vow to get a portable breakfast sandwich tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I hurry to the first panel and sit down in a seat at the end of one of the rows, unwinding multiple scarves and trying not to breathe too loudly. Sitting at the end of an empty row means everyone has to step over me. But I will not yield because the hurry and the oatmeal have made me sweaty, and it’s best if I keep as far away from everyone as possible.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_8991" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8991" data-attachment-id="8991" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/02/27/how-not-to-eat-at-awp-2012/subway/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/subway.jpg" data-orig-size="1288,374" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="subway" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/subway.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/subway.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/subway.jpg?w=300&#038;h=87" alt="subway" title="subway" width="300" height="87" class="size-medium wp-image-8991" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/subway.jpg?w=300&amp;h=87 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/subway.jpg?w=600&amp;h=174 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/subway.jpg?w=150&amp;h=44 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-8991" class="wp-caption-text">Eat fresh. Or not.</p></div> Once the panel is finished, I realize that, even though I’m not hungry, this will be my only chance to eat until dinner. I’d Yelped a cute lunch place nearby but there’s no time for that, so I duck my head and make a beeline for Subway. Half the conference had the same idea. We cram in next to the plastic tables and try not to graze elbows (unless the writer next to me is famous, in which case I WILL try to graze elbows). Everyone is fumbling with their conference badges and standing on their tiptoes to glare at the cashier, as if that will make the line go faster. I give up and leave. I bought my ticket to AWP and I WILL NOT spend it in a Subway.</p>
<p>While I climb the stairs to the next panel, I remember the peanuts. Every time I fly, I ask for peanuts and only eat one of the two little bags. It seems silly to throw it away, so I save the extra bag in my purse for some indeterminate time. I realize that NOW IS THAT TIME. Outside the conference room, I pour two salty bags of peanuts into my mouth so that the crinkly package doesn’t annoy everyone during the talk. I wash it down with a paper cup of free coffee.</p>
<p>By the time I’m supposed to meet up with my friends for dinner, I’m jittery and my blood sugar is so low I want to buy one of those $8 sandwiches they were selling in the lobby that were more bread than anything else. I know I’m on my way to dinner but I’m concerned I legitimately might not make it. When I get to the lobby, the caterers have gone home to their own dinners. I go back upstairs and walk from conference room to conference room, peeking in each until I find the leftovers from some reception or another. I dart in and grab a sad-looking smashed half of a brownie. To assuage my guilt and shame, I take one of their pamphlets. I never read it.</p>
<p>I meet my friends for dinner and we order all the courses, even though they make you pay extra for salad and bread. We order overpriced bottles of wine. We imagine ourselves a night full of telling stories with strangers, pretending we’ve read books we haven’t, and remembering why writing matters. Instead we are so full we end up in our beds early. I write myself a reminder to get a sandwich in the morning. I lose the note and fall asleep.</p>
<p>By the time I get home I’ll be craving fresh fruit like someone with scurvy. I’ll lay on the couch and eat apples and vow to eat like a normal human being next year. By next year I’ll forget, but I keep collecting extra bags of airplane peanuts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>EarthBound</em> does not begin with a plane ride. This, to me, right now, is the one place where the game feels wrong. In 1995, a 10-year-old would have been able to get on an airplane alone. (I did, as a 10-year-old, and while I don&#8217;t remember specifically, chances are that I did as a 16-year-old in 1995 as well.) I&#8217;m not totally sure whether Ness should get on a plane at the very beginning, or whether he should start abroad, and then take a plane home after discovering a mysterious meteor. Ness starts the game at home, and a plane ride feels like it would be the perfect vehicle for the sense of dislocation that seems to drive <em>EarthBound</em>.</p>
<p>Ness starts his quest walking around the local town of Onett (yes, I&#8217;m still talking about the beginning, I&#8217;ll come back to that), a normal-ish place with a hotel, a bank, shops, and an arcade. Ness can buy hamburgers, a hat. It all seems perfectly natural, except that the player is seeing all this for the very first time. I don&#8217;t know the streets. I&#8217;ve never seen the people behind the counter before. And the hamburgers don&#8217;t just make you feel good, they restore your health. The hat is armor. The tough-looking kids at the arcade aren&#8217;t just up to no good, they attack you. It&#8217;s all perfectly normal, and perfectly strange.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this week, I got on a plane. A meteor just fell, and my family and I are looking for a new place to live. It feels a bit like we have super powers. We call people and they take us up unfamiliar stairways and unlock new doors. I&#8217;m driving a different car, listening to different sounds beamed in from space. Peanut butter doesn&#8217;t just make me feel good, it keeps me going.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having a hard time distinguishing between my life and the game. I&#8217;m finding myself in places with names like Onett, Found Stone, Happy Happy, Sour Cherry. I&#8217;m looking at the same apartments in different colors. I&#8217;m looking at the same monsters in different colors. I&#8217;m doing things again and again.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this week, I got on a plane. Everything had changed already, but stepping into a pressurized metal tube and bouncing through the air gave me a transition, like a loading screen. I had to wait and look at things. There were stores, but the prices were different. A baseball hat was armor. I talk to people and they say the same things again and again. Things look similar, fall into the same patterns, but everything is totally different.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s a light beneath everything. I&#8217;ve only caught a glimpse of it, and I have a long way to go, but I&#8217;m still chasing after it.</p>
<p>Next week: Back to the game, if I can start telling it apart from my life again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aloha, fair readers. In case you aren’t friends with me on Facebook or didn’t notice my incessant posting, I was in Hawaii last week on a birthday trip from Charlie. We stayed in a hotel a block from Waikiki Beach on the island of Oahu. Waikiki is this sort of strange paradise where everything looks like a postcard, but so much of it is so touristy that we had a hard time telling what was authentic and what wasn’t. At any moment I thought someone might jump out and tell us we were actually on a movie set and this was all a gigantic piece of scenery. Do Hawaiians actually call each other “cousin,” or did they just do that on our tours? Who knows.</p>

<p>Like any good tourists, one of the main things on our agenda was to eat a shit-ton of food. On our first night, we were so jetlagged and confused by the fact that it was still balmy at 11 p.m. that we had a late dinner at an open-air Cheesecake Factory. Our meal was lit by flickering torches and all I could smell was the tuberose lei around my neck. (Say what you want about Cheesecake Factory, but I’ve never had a meal there that wasn’t awesome.)</p>
<p>The next night, we boarded a tour bus with our guide Cousin K (Yep. Try to take that seriously, if you can) and headed off to a luau. Cousin K gave us tips for getting the most out of our drink tickets and for sitting where we’d be the first to the buffet and have the best view of the ocean. And, best of all, he didn’t force us to sing anything (unlike some other tour guides I could mention).</p>
<p>After getting off the bus and getting leid (har har), Charlie and I shoved other people aside and booked it to go grab a table where Cousin K had recommended.</p>

<p>Charlie came back from the bar with a few extra drink tickets from an older woman who gave them to us because we “looked young,” along with a large mai tai. We both took our shoes off and watched the sun set and watched other tourists take nervous, awkward pictures with the insanely good-looking hula dancers. Neither of us had much to say. We were a little shell-shocked that everything could be so perfect. What kind of place was this?</p>
<p>Then, it was time to eat. We were summoned with an effing conch shell to where the pig was buried in the ground to roast.</p>

<p>After some ceremonial words and torch-lighting, none of which I understood, they enlisted two burly dudes (well, one burly dude and Cousin K) to pull the pig out of the ground. Vegetarians, you might want to look away at this point.</p>

<p>Thanks to Cousin K’s tip-off, we were one of the first dismissed to go get food. Because it happened so quickly, I sort of doubt that the pig pulled out of the ground was the one we actually ate. But I’m going to go ahead and pretend that either they are super fast or we ate one they’d prepared in the exact same way an hour earlier. Even though, as you know, I’m a picky eater, I filled my tray with as much as I could. I figured that even if the food was gross, I’d be eating gross food in <em>Hawaii.</em></p>

<p>In the upper left, you’ll notice another mai tai. The left side of my plate was macaroni salad, rice, and fried fish &#8212; Americanized, nothing special. In the bottom, on the middle, was pineapple coleslaw. I’m the worst Polish girl ever in that I don’t like cabbage, but I tried a little, and my god was it delicious. Not onion-y at all. I even tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poi_%28food%29" target="_blank"><em>poi</em></a>, a Hawaiian food made from the taro plant. It looked like a dip or a soup, but it’s not really either and we were supposed to eat it by itself. It’s known for being odd (a lot of Hawaiians don’t even like it much), and I kept confusing it with <em>koi</em> fish, so I got grossed out and didn’t eat much of it.</p>
<p>Now, let me draw your attention to the meat. When I saw the pig come out of the ground, I was sure the meat would be fatty. I’m very picky about my meat &#8212; I don’t bother with steak unless it’s a filet mignon, and I rarely eat sausage or ribs because I hate chewing on fat. Apparently some people like that? I don’t understand it at all. But this pork. It had almost the texture of pulled pork, and was amazingly tender without an ounce of fat. I could’ve eaten an entire plate of it. It didn’t need sauce, gravy, salt, or pepper. Let me tell you how good it was: I wish I’d left the cake and filled that part of the tray with meat instead.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was full of mai tais, piña coladas, holding hands with strangers (several times during various “giving thanks” and/or “welcome” and or “goodbye” songs), and sexy hula dancing.</p>

<p>By the time we got home, we crashed and went to bed at 10:30pm like an old couple.</p>
<p>On one of our last days, we cut up a locally grown pineapple for lunch. Whether we were dehydrated or just wearing vacation goggles I don’t know, but the pineapple was orgasmically good &#8212; sweeter and juicier than any I’ve ever had. I feel dirty even writing about it.</p>
<p>We ate the entire thing in one sitting.</p>
<p>Postscript: In Hawaiian, <em>aloha</em> means not only “hello” and “goodbye,” but also “love.” So this post is brought to you from the F Word with aloha.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I fell for tequila long before I ever traveled to Mexico. From what I remember &#8212; although tequila memories are always a bit blurry &#8212; I’ve never actually fallen because of tequila. That honor goes to the Mexican dark beer, <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/75/667" target="_blank">Negra Modelo</a>. Cerveza oscura  &#8212; dark beer &#8212; was my drink of choice on the weekends in <a href="http://www.stuinmobiliaria.com/ixtapa-zihuatanejo-costa-grande-guerrero/" target="_blank">Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo</a> after I started living and working in Mexico.  </p>
<p>A story for another day. . .</p>
<p>When I was in high school and college my liquor was whiskey. It wasn’t until I graduated and started working that I tasted tequila. My best friend on my first job, as an internal auditor at the first “too big to fail bank” <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/04/18/mckenna-speaks-at-american-accounting-assn-public-interest-conference/" target="_blank">Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company in Chicago</a>, was the oldest of five children of Mexican immigrants. Maria invited me to all the family’s gatherings. </p>
<p>Tequila was an important part of parties at their house, and the men &#8212; and Maria’s mother, sisters, and aunts – drank tequila shots to celebrate the new year, a birthday, a baptism, or just about any happy occasion and all the sad ones. Maria’s father, Rodolfo, taught me a rule of thumb for drinking tequila – one is never enough and three is too many.</p>
<p>When I started working in Mexico following that rule kept me safe.</p>
<p>I went to Mexico – and Argentina and Brazil – in 1997 as the project leader for J.P. Morgan’s Year 2000 (Y2K) project in Latin America. At that time, I was working for KPMG Consulting. Later I would go to work for J.P. Morgan directly in Latin America so I could stay on the project and in the region. I returned to the states at the end of 2001 after returning to BearingPoint, the successor firm of KPMG Consulting, once the Y2K project was completed.</p>
<p>During the early years of the project, 1997-1998, I worked primarily in Mexico. It was closer to New York, where the JP Morgan global team was based, and I preferred Mexico to Brazil or Argentina. Not that I didn’t like the other two countries. They have their charms, but Mexico was where I felt most comfortable.</p>
<p>I was the boss. As a woman, a foreign woman, you might think I had a hard time. Not at all. I could read and write Spanish fairly well when I arrived and worked hard to learn how to understand spoken Spanish and to speak as an educated professional during my time there. </p>
<p>My team, all men, were a big help in achieving that goal. The best way to learn a language, after loving with it, is to socialize using it.</p>
<p>The majority of the team came from the local KPMG offices and the rest from the local J.P. Morgan offices. There were a few women working with me in Argentina and Brazil, but in Mexico City it was all men. Management assigned primarily the younger professionals to help me with the tedious testing and documentation tasks needed to successfully complete the projects in each country before the start of the new millennium.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, KPMG is KPMG all over the world. We worked hard and played harder. The Mexican professionals treated me like a queen. We celebrated a project milestone or just the end of a long week together and I never had to eat alone if I didn’t want to. I never felt alone or unsafe in Mexico City. </p>
<p>One of the restaurants we liked to go was Mezzanotte, in Polanco on Avenida Presidente Masaryk. It was great because they had excellent Italian food and then, later in the evening, it turned into a nightclub. If you stayed through dinner you could keep your table and we danced the nights away in between them.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to taking tequila “la bandera,&#8221; Mexican flag style at Mezzanotte. The waiter serves three shot glasses. One has tequila blanco, another has lime juice for the green of the flag and the third contains sangrita, a spicy tomato juice chaser for red. I don’t know if it’s traditional but the guys always made me shout “Viva Mexico!” when we drank “la Bandera.”  </p>
<p>In short time I realized I really liked the taste of tequila. That can be a dangerous and expensive bow to the local culture, since I was never served less than a reposado, or aged 100% agave tequila. More often they ordered an añejo, the finest. I acquired a preference for <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a>, which is wasted if not taken straight. But a lady, and the boss, should not routinely drink her staff of young men under the table via tequila shots. It’s both tacky and a career-limiting move.  </p>
<p>Another restaurant, La Valentina in Polanco , was where the team introduced me to <a href="http://www.cocktailtimes.com/original/don_paloma.shtml" target="_blank">the Paloma</a>. Take a tall glass, some ice, a generous helping of tequila and Squirt. The carbonation in the lemon-lime flavored Mexican version of Squirt &#8212; much more pungent than Squirt available in the United States &#8212; serves as an inebriation antidote. You can have the flavor of tequila, and much more of it than doing straight shots, and remain upright for much longer. This approach, too, has its limits but I thankfully never reached them in any unpleasant way.</p>
<p>Another place the guys took me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Garibaldi" target="_blank">Plaza Garibaldi</a>, the <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2007/12/31/musings-on-the-eve-of-the-new-year/" target="_blank">center of mariachi</a> in Mexico City. The best cantina &#8212; and one a woman is allowed to enter &#8212; is <a href="http://www.planeteyetraveler.com/2010/06/24/cantina-crawl-salon-tenampa/" target="_blank">Salón Tenampa</a>. The only thing you drink there is tequila and only by the shot. All the better to get drunk enough to sing along. I’m still a big fan of mariachi. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mofzQYHbOw" target="_blank">“Volver, volver, volver a tus brazos otra vez. . .”</a> </p>
<p>I didn’t go home to Chicago much during this period. The Christmas holiday is the one time I always went back to cold, snowy Chicago. After a while the city seemed so much less warm than Mexico. I always picked up a bottle of very good tequila &#8212; something different each time but always an añejo &#8212; for Christmas at Maria’s and shots with her father. Each year I also bought Cuervo’s annual Reserva de la Familia special edition tequila in a wooden box hand-painted by a Mexican artist. My favorite one is <a href="http://www.cuervo.com/products/box.aspx?artist=grabados-de-artemio" target="_blank">the first, 1997</a>, by Artemio Rodriguez because it’s a typical Mexican drawing, white on blue.</p>
<p>There’s a bottle of <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/anejos/herradura-tequila-anejo.html" target="_blank">Herradura añejo</a> in my cabinet now. There’s also a bottle of Cuervo for margaritas and one of those long, tall, blue bottles containing <a href="http://www.tequila.net/tequila-reviews/reposados/corralejo-tequila-reposado.html" target="_blank">Corralejo Reposado</a>.</p>
<p>I have my tequila but I do miss <a href="http://retheauditors.com/2011/02/02/special-for-forbes-a-business-travel-story-about-mexico/" target="_blank">Mexico</a> mucho.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am mainly a beer drinker, but I like to say I am an “equal opportunity drinker,” so I will try anything once. </p>
<p>When I was prepping for my recent journey to the Keweenaw Peninsula (some 550 miles away from me in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula), I reached out a friend who attended college in the area.</p>
<p>He gave me a detailed list of destinations, attractions, and bars. It was more than enough to go on for my short visit. Then, a few days before I was to set out on my trip, he sent me another email. It contained a simple message:</p>
<p>“Go to Shute&#8217;s in Calumet and have a drink called a Moscow Mule.”</p>

Delicious.”</p>
<p>It sounded good to me. I’m a fan of ginger beer on its own, and bringing vodka to the party would only add to the fun.</p>
<p>Fast forward several days, and I was in Calumet with my girlfriend Steph, and we found Shute’s resting on a corner. It was an old, thin building—but long. It was built in the 1800s during the hay day of copper mining.</p>
<p>We walked in and were amazed by the interior. The bar maintained its Victorian feel and look: dark wood, murals, a glass awning over the bar. A young bartender asked for our order, and I quickly replied “Two Moscow Mules.” He seemed both pleased and surprised by the request, because we stood out like tourists. </p>
<p>I watched him make the drinks, and moments later, they were before us, in copper mugs as my friend promised. The first sip was glorious and refreshing&#8211;it was a hot, sunny day outside. The ginger and lime masked any flavor of the vodka, letting me know this drink could prove dangerous and sneak up on me. </p>
<p>We chatted with the bartender, as we were especially interested in the copper mugs. “I usually ask for a driver’s license to hold when I make those.”</p>
<p>“Why?” I asked between sips.</p>
<p>“We had a couple of them walk away this winter. And they are $25 a piece.” This price was later confirmed when Steph and I visited a nearby gift shop. </p>
<p>The bartender went on to share more about the drink: it is actually a double shot of vodka, which happened to be Five O’Clock, and he did a slow count while pouring. He had to use Vernor’s ginger ale, as real ginger beer was too expensive, and they were already undercharging at $4 a pop (Travel Tip: you can drink for cheap in the Keweenaw).</p>
<p>While we finished our drinks, the bartender shared some of the history of the bar, the town, and of the early days of mining. History was all around us in Calumet.</p>
<p>It was my first Moscow Mule, and it was worth the drive from Lansing. It will be a drink, and a moment, I will always remember.</p>
