										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong> Remember <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/16/a-day-in-the-life/">my <em>Octodad</em> review</a>? Well, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1432651738/octodad-2?at=1f33aab22cb79d0b&amp;response_id=450058" target="_blank">they are making a sequel</a> thanks to Kickstarter.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1432651738/octodad-2/posts" target="_blank">they’ve re-released <em>Octodad</em> in celebration</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to properly celebrate this occasion we’ve decided to release an updated version of Octodad 1 with <strong>TWO NEW LEVELS!</strong> Right now only the <strong>Windows v1.5</strong> is available due to some issues with Mac’s Lion OS, but Mac owners can expect their own v1.5 in <strong>September</strong>. Now these levels aren’t for the feint of heart and are a bit of a challenge, but they do bring a bit of closure to the first game’s story.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Gavin’s reflections about <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/08/06/let-me-tell-you-a-story/">narratives in video games</a> plays nicely with a Rock, Paper, Shotgun piece about why <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/01/look-single-player-people-are-just-better/" target="_blank">single player gamers are a better ilk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stress again, I would hate it if I appeared pompous at all when I suggest that single-player gaming, ever-more the forgotten gem of our hobby, is for the more sophisticated, intellectual individual. It takes something more, a different kind of mind, a more educated, refined view, to understand and value the art of the single-player. Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>The worth of single-player comes in the form of narrative. As with any good novel, or a finely crafted film. It is the equivalent to literature. While multiplayer is an ill-informed argument. It has no direction, no beginning nor end, no meaning.</p>
<p>Games are made with intent. Like books, films and television, the finest examples among them are those that both exist to say something, but allow the player to create his own interpretation. And while of course there are any number of poor or stupid single-player games, there is no multiplayer that evenly closely matches the finest RPG or adventure.</p>
<p>Like I say, I would be just mortified if anyone interpreted these words to be snooty or condescending. I’m just saying people who prefer single player games are a better class than people who mostly opt for multiplayer.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.roflgames.com/DPadWebsite/www/index.htm" target="_blank"><em>Owlboy</em> will be released this year.</a> It’s one of the few platformers I’ve actually gotten excited about since <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/" target="_blank"><em>Doukustu Monogatari</em></a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkwgJK88Ajs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The demo should be released on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The Independent Games Festival’s chairman, Brandon Boyer, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36571/GDC_Europe_We_Have_A_Responsibility_To_Support_Indies_Says_IGF_Chairman_Boyer.php#comment115948" target="_blank">calls for independent developers to push the limits of the game experience and for consumers to pay a fair wage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For too long we’ve been relying on this model that says that games are more or less interchangeable products, marketed and sold as products, and if they’re all just slight variations on the same theme, or if they do little more than give our thumbs something to do in idle time, of course we’re going to be wise shoppers and choose the cheapest among them.</p>
<p>An album purchased on iTunes can cost nearly ten times as much as most people are willing to spend on a game — even when that album itself is actually embedded in the game — [the slide here is of the $1.99 NOBY NOBY BOY app sitting right on top of the $11.99 NOBY NOBY BOY soundtrack] but by and large people don’t buy an album to listen to it once and complain it only took 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>People value music more because it adds an emotional pitch and rhythm and color to life, it speaks to something more essential, it reminds them of a place and time, it reminds them of where they were when they first experienced it and who they experienced it with.</p>
<p>And there’s no reason that we shouldn’t also be aspiring to that same exact sort of resonance in whatever small ways, crafting experiences that invite people to return to them, not because it extends a dollar value, but because it feels like a place they actually want to re-visit, or adds that same color and rhythm.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Lastly, here is a cinematic trailer for the <em>Guns of Icarus</em> MMO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are anything like me, you got sick of steampunk around the same time you stopped reading Boing Boing. My initial delight with steampunk is almost certainly connected to my love of good sci-fi and fantasy. The connection between magic and technology is nearly essential for the genre, if only for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>My techno-scientific geek brain knows that the devices like airships couldn’t work without some sort of alchemy.</li>
<li>The technology often is so advanced, despite its analog bent, that Clarke’s third law applies.*</li>
</ol>
<p>But after hundreds of cosplay pictures and derivative movies, comics, and video games, the novelty began to wear. Yet one day, about a year ago during a quiet afternoon of unemployment, I found myself playing a game described thusly, “In an apocalyptic steampunk future, you are a privateer ferrying goods across treacherous airspace. Protect your airship and yourself from an onslaught of pirates, and safely reach your destination to reap the rewards.”</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/6967593" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Admittedly, by the description, I was expecting something RPG-ish, a simple, stripped down <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skies_of_Arcadia" target="_blank">Skies of Arcadia</a> (an exceedingly wonderful Dreamcast game), but <a href="http://musegames.com/games/guns-of-icarus" target="_blank">Guns of Icarus</a> was decidedly not that and my expectation certainly explains some of the other reviews you can find online:</p>
<blockquote><p>You’ve already imagined something more spectacular than Guns of Icarus can offer. This third-person action game’s midbattle story panels may hint at such a time and place, but the game itself is a one-note diversion that tips its full hand within minutes of starting your first play-through. As it stands, there is a bare-bones version of the game you can already play for free within your Web browser. – Kevin VanOrd, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/gunsoficarus/review.html" target="_blank">Gamespot</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There is really no story here at all. Each level has a little postcard before it with some trite description of the hardships of that region, but there is no explanation whatsoever of the main character’s (note that I don’t use the word protagonist) motivations. Why is he delivering cargo? Why does it have to be in a Zeppelin? Who is he delivering to? Why does he commit suicide-by-pirate at the end? Why did he bring cargo with him when he went off to die? No explanation is given for anything, and the entire campaign is over in about 20 minutes. &#8211; CB Droege, <a href="http://gaming.icrontic.com/reviews/guns-of-icarus-review/" target="_blank">Icrontic</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These descriptions are as accurate as they are misguided. The game was originally developed for a <em>web browser</em>. I have never found a robust story in a browser based game (please prove me wrong), let alone one that lasts more than twenty minutes. Their beauty tends to be in simple, repetitive game machines, something fun to pick up now and again, play a quick round, and then get back to work. If that’s the standard, then this game shines brilliantly.</p>

<p>There are only really two game mechanics, shoot the attacking pirates and repair your ship. Each mission is measured by distance between the two locations you are carrying undescribed cargo to and from. En route you are assaulted, depending on difficulty, by three different sorts of aircraft who damage your will damage your engines (which will eventually halt your progress forward), cargo hold (you get ship upgrades, if you have enough cargo left over), rigging, and the zeppelin (which will make you explode). The longer the route you take in the campaign, the more upgrades you get, and the more prepared you are to go <strong>Into The Breach</strong>.</p>

<p>You can’t not die in The Breach, the entire point is to survive as long as possible by killing by managing your time killing air pirates and repairing your ship. Your distance meter ticks up, rather than down, and the further the distance, the further the bragging rights. The best part? Multiplayer co-op (up to four) with url-based invites which, combined with Twitter, would make it incredibly easy to have a mid-afternoon pick-up game.</p>
<p>Totally worth it for <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/49800" target="_blank">five bucks</a> (originally, ten for the full version), especially if you can sucker a few friends to buy it on a quiet Saturday afternoon.  And, if this game does tickle your steampunk funny bone, you should be aware <a href="http://gunsoficarus.com/community/blog/mechanical-renaissance/" target="_blank">an MMO is in development</a>.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>*For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws" target="_blank">the non-geek</a>: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</p>
