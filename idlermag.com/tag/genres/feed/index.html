										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Kevin, you make me nervous when you talk about Daniel as being <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wJ">&#8220;100 years old.&#8221;</a> I&#8217;m the old man of the bunch, after all, and if anyone ever goes back to those first <a href="https://idlermag.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii/">Final Fantasy VII</a> posts and figures out how old that actually is, I might get my game columnist license revoked.</p>
<p>Anyway, before we get too far into a &#8220;who&#8217;s older than whom&#8221; argument, let me say that I&#8217;m digging the choice of <em>Cave Story</em> as our Gamers&#8217; Club game. I&#8217;m sometimes a bit jealous of the world of indie or other unusual downloadable games that exist in the PC world or on the XBox Live Arcade service. I do have Steam installed on my Mac, but it&#8217;s old and underpowered, and I&#8217;ve been burned before, spending hours downloading a game only to find that my lappy couldn&#8217;t even open it. So I&#8217;m blissfully happy to not only be able to get <em>Cave Story</em> on WiiWare, but to have something to do with my woefully underused Wii and an excuse to pull my <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/29/in-control/">WaveBird</a> out of storage. (I&#8217;m a little bit put off that the game is $12 on WiiWare when it&#8217;s only $10 on Steam, but I&#8217;ll get over it.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played about an hour and a half of <em>Cave Story</em> so far, and already it&#8217;s grabbed me in a way that <a href="https://idlermag.com/tag/earthbound/">EarthBound</a> never did. I&#8217;m not deep enough into the story to say much in narrative terms about why that might be &#8212; and I&#8217;ll admit that I do want to go back to <em>EarthBound</em> on my own another day to try and figure out why so many classic RPG fans love it so much &#8212; so my initial take is that <em>Cave Story</em> does a really great job of mixing the architecture of the 2D platform game with the narrative techniques of the classic 2D RPG. (That is, it&#8217;s another example that <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/06/01/sucked-in/">game architecture isn&#8217;t determinative of genre</a>.) The game uses platform mechanics to allow the player to navigate the world, but RPG mechanics to deliver the story. The player jumps from ledge to ledge to get around town, and explore new areas, and has conversations with non-player characters (NPCs) to find out what to do next.</p>
<p>And for me, right now, that mixture is magic. The platformer elements add a bit of challenge and interest as I&#8217;m exploring, and the RPG story elements give me a reason to keep exploring, and to keep jumping in the difficult parts. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/11/18/mario-gets-old/">written</a> <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/10/playing-the-penguin/">before</a> that I&#8217;m not a big fan of platformers, but I&#8217;m enjoying <em>Cave Story</em>, and looking forward to playing more.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more I&#8217;m looking forward to talking about, hell, we could probably do an entire post just listing the cultural and video game references &#8212; Balrog alone cites both <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wG">Kool-Aid Man</a>, and there&#8217;s something very <em>Metroid</em> about the way the game makes you navigate vertically and horizontally, and retrace your steps rather than moving in a single direction <em>Ã  la</em> Mario. Finally, I&#8217;m curious to know if anyone else noticed that when the Balrog asks if you want to fight, you can actually say &#8220;no&#8221; and he goes away. If the game is short enough, I my play though a second time just to find out if not fighting the Balrog has an impact later in the game. (I wanted the &#8220;experience&#8221; triangles, so I didn&#8217;t fight the Balrog in the demo, but I did fight him in my current playthrough of the full version. I also did some grinding in the graveyard, killing and respawning the knife-slasher frog until my pistol was at full power.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually a bit giddy, boys. It&#8217;s taking all my willpower to not start chanting <a href="http://mission17.org/documents/Derrida_LawOfGenre.pdf">&#8220;Genres are not to be mixed. I will not mix genres.&#8221;</a> (That&#8217;s right. I just threw down some Derrida. Bla-dow.)</p>
<p>Onward! Next time I talk about the actual story, rather than just acknowledge that it exists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not a post about <em>Portal 2</em>, even though I&#8217;ve been playing the game so much that my wife has started to make cracks about me loving the game more than her. (It&#8217;s not true, just in case you&#8217;re wondering. I&#8217;ve been chasing trophies in the single-player game while I wait for the PSN co-op mode to come back up. Or to get someone to use my second controller here. Maybe my wife. . .)</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m going talk about the first <em>Portal</em>, released for the PS3 as part of <em>The Orange Box</em> in 2007. It&#8217;s kind of hard to track down in that form these days, even though the XBox version is $20, and everywhere. If you can&#8217;t track it down for your PS3, you can play it on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, VALVEe&#8217;s online gaming community on your Mac or PC.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever played the original <em>Portal</em>, <em>Portal 2</em> makes total sense. <em>Portal 2</em> gives you new puzzle pieces, and larger, more varied environments, but it does such an incredible job of building a rich, multilayered world using the same tools as the original <em>Portal</em>, that it&#8217;s easy to forget how unique and engagingly odds those tools were the first time around.</p>
<p><em>Portal</em> initially presents itself as a perfectly transparent environment. You wake up in a glass cube, and you are instructed to enter a series of chambers where you use a portal gun and a number of environmental objects to solve twenty spacial/sequential puzzles. You&#8217;re told at the beginning where the endpoint is going to be&mdash;with the exception of the first &#8220;00&#8221; chamber, each test chamber is numbered 1/19, 2/19, etc.</p>
<p>Until, of course, the whole thing goes off the rails. GLaDOS, the malevolent artificial intelligence whose voice guides and taunts you in turns, is actually trying to kill you. (There are hints throughout the game that she&#8217;s done this before.) The final puzzle ends with a platform slowly lowering itself into molten metal. After escaping from this deathtrap, you have to find your way through the machinery behind the puzzle rooms and eventually to GLaDOS herself, whom you have to destroy.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways of looking at <em>Portal</em>. It&#8217;s a wildly entertaining puzzle game. <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/f/classicradar-portal-is-the-most-subversive-game-ever/a-20110321105926471036/p-2" target="_blank">It&#8217;s the most subversive first-person shooter ever created.</a> It&#8217;s a master class on <a href="http://scrawledinwax.com/2010/06/16/the-ideology-valve-then-there-will-be-cake-guest-post/" target="_blank">game design which leads you forward on a specific path while persuading you that you&#8217;ve found the way yourself</a>. I&#8217;d like to argue, however, that <em>Portal</em> is a remarkable illustration of the distinction (in video games) between architecture and genre, and the results that are possible when you exploit and break down genre conventions.</p>

<p>Sorting <em>Portal</em> into a specific genre is a bit tricky. While the game is built on a first-person shooter engine (much like VALVe&#8217;s <em>Half Life</em> series), it&#8217;s really impossible to describe the game itself as a first-person shooter. You don&#8217;t really have a gun. There are almost no enemies to be killed, and the dangers you face are largely environmental&mdash;water hazards, physical obstacles that will push you off of moving platforms, and stationary turrets that will shoot you on sight but will shut down if you simply knock them over. In fact, <em>Portal</em> is constructed as a puzzle game where the world explodes at the end. After twenty increasingly complex discrete environments, you &#8220;escape&#8221; into space. You climb rusty stairs and squeeze between heavy machinery. It&#8217;s no longer clear where the endpoint will be. At times it seems that GLaDOS can see you, and at times you appear to be undetectable. You keep trying to move forward, although from time to time you have to stop to figure out where exactly forward is.</p>
<p>The twenty-first &#8220;escape&#8221; level is by far the longest level in <em>Portal</em>, although it&#8217;s still clearly designed to be completed in a single session. When I played for the first time, you couldn&#8217;t have convinced me to turn it off. My heart raced, and I&#8217;m a bit ashamed to say that for the first time in the game I resorted to some online guides when I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out what to do next. I didn&#8217;t want to stop and save and think. I had to keep running. I didn&#8217;t feel safe in any particular spot, not usually because of any direct, impending danger, but because I suddenly had no idea of what would happen next. I knew I was headed toward a confrontation with GLaDOS, but I didn&#8217;t have any idea what I could possibly use as a weapon. While I loved all the puzzle levels, and imagined myself writing an article about how the game largely removed itself from time&mdash;that is, most of the puzzles aren&#8217;t based on reflexes so much as figuring out how to use a tool to solve a problem&mdash;but the final level creates a compelling sense of urgency, largely because of the idyllic timeless abstraction of the earlier levels.</p>
<p>Which, in the end, is <em>Portal</em>&#8216;s big secret. It&#8217;s not a first-person shooter. It&#8217;s not a puzzle game where the world explodes at the end. If you take the narrative seriously, <em>Portal</em> is actually a single-level game with a clever twenty-stage tutorial. <em>Portal 2</em> reinforces this. While there are recognizable puzzle levels&mdash;and part of the fun of <em>Portal 2</em> is the way that aesthetics, the different &#8220;skins&#8221; that are draped over the same wire-frame 3D architecture are used to convey time, setting, and story&mdash;the puzzle levels exist to teach you how to use the increasing variety of tools that you need to use to navigate the spaces between worlds. Even more so, the puzzles themselves exist within the worlds this time, giving you more frequent opportunities to peek outside, and occasionally to move in and out of the puzzle spaces.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s all built on a single fascinating twenty-stage tutorial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it safe to say that the horror genre is generally  considered to be a relatively low quality one?Â   That is to say, regardless of box office, can most of us agree that the  genre has a pretty poor output to quality ratio?Â  Just take a look at Netflixâs horror  section.Â  There are few films rated  higher than two stars and fewer still higher than three.</p>

These are filmmakers of the highest order and they bring  something to the table most horror directors let fall to the wayside:  depth.Â  These are well made films that  donât spend the majority of their time referencing others in their genre,  constantly winking at us.Â  They do not  rely on the shock value of gore and nudity.Â   The absurdity of the conclusion of <em>Rosemaryâs Baby</em> would not have worked as  well as it does without Polanskiâs ability to craft such a phenomenal paranoid  thriller beforehand.Â  Youâre already in  it to win it before those kooky tenants reveal Rosemaryâs black-eyed  baby!</p>
<p>But what about some more current stuff?Â  Is there  anything in the genre worthwhile?</p>

(cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers) of the <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqDToaLuJ7I">early eighties</a>.Â   These guys are <em>actually</em> scary.Â   But more importantly, we care about the protagonists.Â  And after watching them fight, panic and  squeeze their way through claustrophobic tunnels for the better part of an hour the film&#8217;s mad, bloody crescendo feels like a release.</p>

She continuously visits him in their apartment complex&#8217;sÂ courtyard, barefoot in the snow, impervious to the cold.Â  She repeatedly tells himÂ that she cannot be his friend, and yet.Â  <em>Let The Right One In</em> is a vampire film unlike anything you&#8217;ve ever seen, and I hear  the <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reRRAEVHq8E">American remake</a> is actually quite good.Â  Surely a testament to its source material.</p>
<p>And so there is hope.Â  You needn&#8217;t settle on theÂ straight-to-video tripe that clutters up genre.Â Â Like anything worthwhile,Â truly great  horror filmsÂ have to be sought out. Any suggestions?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Films are time capsules. They reflect the trends of the era: The fashion, the cars, and the political climate. Nowhere is this more evident than in the films of the 70s. Just as film was evolving, we were evolving as a nation. Presidential scandals are fairly commonplace now but in 1972 the nation was rocked by Watergate. That, coupled with the growing dissatisfaction with the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, created a climate of unrest and mistrust with the government and it wasnât long before those feelings translated to film. Thus, a niche genre was created in 1974 that had a healthy life throughout the decade: The paranoid thriller.

In a paranoid thriller you donât know who to trust. You donât trust your friends, you donât trust your government and you certainly donât trust your lover. Your home isnât safe. <em>Maybe itâs been bugged</em>. You donât go to the police. <em>Maybe theyâre in on it</em>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 100+ year history of cinema, there is no doubt in my mind that the 70s represented the best era of filmmaking. It was a time driven by creativity, not box office. Films were driven by character, not plot and CGI was a meaningless acronym. Modern cinema evolved from the rules that were broken during this decade of decadence. The word âfuckâ was first uttered in a major studio film in 1970. Sex became more graphic. Violence became more realistic. Even the summer blockbuster was invented in 1975. Modern masters like Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg, and DePalma were mere novices paving the road to the future at twenty-four frames per second. Film today would not be where it is without the trends set in the 70s.</p>

Playing as almost a direct reaction to Watergate, itâs perhaps the epitome of the genre. <em>The Conversation</em> chronicles Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), an expert in wiretapping and surveillance, as he becomes increasingly unhinged by his inability to interpret a recording of what may or may not be a murder plot. The irony is that Caul is an expert in invading other peopleâs privacy yet is obsessed and consumed with maintaining his own, even living off the grid (or as off the grid you can get in 1974).  Typically in a paranoid thriller the hero turns to his friends for help, but Caul has alienated all his friends here with his intense obsession with his privacy. The filmâs haunting final shot perhaps serves as the defining image of this sub-genre.</p>

Interestingly, <em>The Conversation</em> and <em>The Parallax View</em> both use the plot device of our hero being unwittingly tricked. Not only can the hero not trust the people around him, he canât even trust himself. <em>Parallax</em> also uses Warren Beattyâs 70s cool to its advantage to create an engaging hero as opposed to Gene Hackmanâs troubled and icy Harry Caul.</p>

He finds himself on the run from not only the assassins but from his own employer, which may have been behind the hit. <em>All the Presidentâs Men</em> (or <em>ATPM</em> as my friends and I call it) is a cinematic version of Watergate detailing the reporters who helped uncover the scandal. While <em>ATPM</em> covers its source accurately and professionally, <em>Condor</em> takes a more cinematic approach that makes for a film thatâs more fun. <em>Condor</em> is also the most aggressive of these thrillers in taking on the government. In this story, the entire CIA may be the enemy.</p>
<p>Other notable paranoid thrillers of the 70s include <em>Marathon Man</em> (1976), the little seen <em>Winter Kills</em> (1979) and, to a more abstract degree, the critically lauded <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> (1978). These films are fun relics of their era and every film listed here is a skillful thriller in its own right. For fans of 70s cinema, these are required viewing but for those interested in broadening their film palette, I suggest you take a walk through this brief but memorable sub-genre. Just make sure youâre watching with someone you trustâ¦</p>
