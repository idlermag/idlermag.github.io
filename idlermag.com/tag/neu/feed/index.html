										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consider the great bands in music, and then consider what makes these bands rise above the usual accolades into <em>being</em> something great. So many groups have tandems within the band, two artists that provide direction and ability. Two artists who may develop friction. I remember reading about the Clash and coming across a passage describing Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. I am paraphrasing but I have always remembered the quote as saying, “The Heart and the Head, the Rhythm and the Groove.” Your heart represents the passion and the routine by the very nature of the organ there is nothing by rhythm; the head with its ability to free flow and really flitter around your skull is the groove, a squiggly line going from point A to point B. With the Clash Strummer was the Heart, Jones was the Head. Think about other tandems in rock. The Stones: Mick Jagger the Head, Keith Richards the Groove. These tandems are combined of artists of similar interests that grow and learn from each other before surpassing each other and eventually chafing at each other. Out of this tension and friction can come great art as well as great wreckage of bands ruined. The German band NEU! is one of those bands, a meeting of great art that ended in great wreckage. </p>
<p>NEU! was two people: Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger. Rother plays guitar, Dinger plays drums. Boom, two people making such lovely music. The history of the band centers around the city of Dusseldorf as Dinger was from there, fled from there and returned there after the war. Rother was the son of a man who moved around (Munich, Hamburg, England, Pakistan) before settling in Dusseldorf. Both men would play in small-time bands, each honing their skills. As I mentioned in my article on <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/06/23/kraftwerk-the-early-days/">the early days of Kraftwerk</a>, Rother and Dinger were in an early incarnation of that band. In fact, Dinger played drums on the very first Kraftwerk LP. August of 1971 saw the two split from the formative Kraftwerk to form their own group. Together the band recorded and released their self-titled debut LP in 1972.</p>
<p>Right away you can hear the music split between the two men. <em>NEU!</em> varies between long, driven songs with a similar insistent drumbeat and glistening playing. Really that is the band, that is their sound, that conflict and friction between the two men. &#8220;Hallogallo&#8221; from <em>NEU!</em> is what I consider the NEU! sound. The song is long and flowing, it conjures up the feeling of motion when standing still. The guitar is what drives the song; the drums are present but subtle rather than dominant. The rest of the LP, to me, sounds like a tug of war between the artists. You get a song that the drums are louder in; you have a song written by Dinger. More guitar, Rother. Regardless the debut is a classic, almost an idea for something new (NEU?) that arrives fully formed. Even with a perceived friction the music is strong and lasting.</p>

<p><em>NEU 2</em>, from 1973 is famous for being half completed before the band ran out of funds. Rather than continue the revamped and modified existing tracks. The song &#8220;Super 16&#8221; is on side two three times in differing speeds. See kids, back in the day your Mom could buy you a portable turntable with differing speeds. You got your 33rpm, your 45rpm and your 78rpm. In rare occasions there was a fourth speed, 16rpm. The Highway HiFi played records at 16rpm, presumably a slow speed would allow for a RECORD TO BE PLAYED IN AN AUTOMOBILE. When that idea circled the drain the 16rpm speed was used primarily for radio transcription discs or LPs of narration for the visually impaired. What did the band do? Well the issued the song on 33 1/3 rpm, sped it up to 78rpm, and then slowed it down to 16rpm. I wonder if the songs would sound like the 33 rpm if you played them on the wrong speed. This experimentation does set the band apart and upon first listen you do feel kind of. . . gypped. But when you really listen to the original songs and their variations the songs become fuller, you understand the textures better when hearing them slowed way down and then sped way up. &#8220;Super 16&#8221; would go on to be featured in <em>Kill Bill</em> in homage to the Kung Fu film, <em>Master of the Flying Guillotine</em>. At the 16rpm the song has deliberate menace where the clang once was. Another aspect of the LP I find so fascinating is the concept of running out of money for studio time. In today’s age of ProTools, Serato, and GarageBand you never need to run out of anything other than your abilities. Of the many outstanding songs on the LP, the second track, &#8220;Spitzenqualitat,&#8221; stands out on repeated listens. Here is a song that Dinger truly shines on, laying down a concrete and repetitive beat that would echo through music for decades. Listen to the drums and the echo and think. Then take a piece of paper and trace the bands that you think of while listening to that drumbeat. At first I heard Public Image Ltd, naturally. But then I thought of Joy Division. In the first 1:44 of the song you hear a direct link to the music of today. Mind-altering stuff.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vrZ7z6Jqt4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Now <em>NEU!75</em> is something new; on this LP you can hear the band pull apart. Side one belongs to Michael Rother, with his glistening guitar and shimmering beauty. The lead off track, &#8220;Isi,&#8221; sounds like everything before and yet is so singular and unique. Rother was playing in another band at this point in time, Harmonia, which is a band for a future column. I see this cut as a direct link to his solo work, <em>Flammende Herzen</em> in particular. The sound is addictive and you just fall into the groove.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/YiMQ5r5y78g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Side two belongs to Dinger. The songs on this side are more song-driven, with a direction to go with the churn. There are lyrics and on the song &#8220;Hero&#8221; the listener gets a feel for where Dinger’s musical intentions are. As with the Rother songs on side one, you can plainly hear where Dinger’s career would take him. After Neu! split he formed a new band, La Dusseldorf. I have only heard some of their catalog but what I have heard the blueprint for their sound is this Neu! song, &#8220;Hero.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYeVvp8sdmg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The friction ripped up the band, but in 1985 the two men reunited for a tumultuous series of recording sessions. The music from this period were cobbled together by Klaus Dinger, and issued by a suspicious label by the name of Captain Trip in 1995 as <em>Neu!4</em>. This release would be a sticking point between the two men up until Dinger’s death in 2008. Yet in 2010 with the re-rerelease of the Neu! catalog the LP was rearranged, tidied up and issued as <em>Neu!86</em>. I have a copy of the original LP and when I listen to it after the collected work of the first three Neu! LPs it is far weaker than anything that came before. It feels, upon listening, that the people playing in the band were not, in fact, Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger. It sounds processed, dated, a relic of the mid 1980s. Am I glad it has been reissued? Sure. Am I clamoring to buy it? No.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rb4Nm-cRdtk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Looking at their catalog as a whole the music of Neu! is remarkable for its beauty and directness. It makes you want to move your feet and your hips. It sounds like sunset and thunderstorms. It sounds like two individuals creating music separate and in tandem, making beautiful music. It sounds like now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we look back at Kraftwerk it is easy to have no knowledge of the early days of the band, before they really were “Kraftwerk.” Springing from the formative West Germany in the 60s Ralf Hutter and Florian Schnieder worked together as far back as 1967. Their first band was called Organization and released a record in 1970. One of the YouTube clips I found was of Organization playing the Essener Pop Und Blues Festival in 1970, playing the song &#8220;Ruckzuck.&#8221; This would become the first song on Kraftwerk’s self-titled late 1970 release. The translated title is &#8220;Quickly,&#8221; and the version with the full Organization band did just that. When I saw this clip it wasn’t as shocking as the footage I will describe, but the clip did really make me think of Santana at Woodstock. Not due to anything more than the size of the band and the groove they are all laying down. The cut in clips of young Germans is also very interesting to see…watch any old WDR clips and the audiences always seem so bored with what they are seeing. Maybe perplexed is more accurate.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eB-sl6ZLpo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><em>Kraftwerk</em> and the follow up, the cleverly titled <em>Kraftwerk 2</em> fit into a mold of musical pieces rather than songs, and my by &#8220;pieces&#8221; I mean in the classical sense of the world. Big C Classical, that is. Many of the songs on these LPs take time to build to a peak or a progression. They feel composed of many different sections that don’t really seem to interconnect. Some are refreshing and intriguing, some are not. <em>2</em> feels much darker in tone and texture than <em>1</em> yet both are surpassed by 1972’s <em>Ralf und Florian</em>. What a title and what an album cover! The music on this LP, side one in particular, seem to owe to the darker sounds on the previous LPs. Side Two contains the song &#8220;Tansmusik&#8221; (dance music), a light and airy song, as well as very danceable; and the track entitled &#8220;Ananas Symphonie&#8221; that breaks down in the translation to &#8220;Pineapple Symphony.&#8221; I love Hawaiian music and this, to me, is a strange amalgam of avant-garde German music with the feeling in the air of Hawaii. Slack key computer if you will. This track directly points towards the aforementioned Autobahn and the road to where we find the band today.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCg7hPeUdvE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>What I did not know or had forgotten was the period in the early 70s when Hutter left the band that the group mutated into a trio. The footage, recorded once again on German TV, just slays me and shocks me. I am still shocked, SHOCKED, that I had never seen these clips before. The footage is of a trio. Florian Schneider is playing flute on the clip, but that wasn’t what I was shocked to see. The guitar player and the drummer, just taken aback by their skill and what they added to the band, startled me. Every clip of footage I have seen of the group have been fairly similar: two to four men, Germans, standing over banks of machines playing flutes or pads the stimulate the sounds.  (Look at the black and white footage of &#8220;Ruckzuck&#8221; compared to the Organization version; the B&amp;W footage shows that Kraftwerk haven’t changed their performing habits in over 40 years) A bit of digging uncovered that this music was recorded during a time that Ralf had left the band and the band slogged on with Michael Rother and Klaus Dinger of Neu! Well, of course the sound was different, Schneider basically joined another band while keeping the band’s name; sort of like marrying your sister-in-law.  But the clips did more than that; the video clips changed my schema of what Kraftwerk is. Before I had a vision of the band as a group that owed more to avant-garde classical music than to the blues or traditional rock sounds. This clip changed that thinking.  The song “Kahkteen, Wuste, Sonne” (cactus, water, sun) sounds and feels like a Kraftwerk song from the era of performance. The song feels textured and propulsive without feeling over dependent on an American musical influence for easy access. Another period clip is of the song, &#8220;Reuckstoss Gondoliere,&#8221; which feels like something you would find on the first side of the first LP. Those songs, yeah, they feel like Kraftwerk in one form or fashion. The clip entitled &#8220;Koln 1971&#8221; is the song that tipped me onto my own head. It smokes, just smokes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqTOwBnNNfc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Even now, having re-listened to all of Kraftwerk’s music, even without detecting more of what I heard in that clip, my definition of what Kraftwerk is and was is changed. Perhaps it was more that seeing the band doing something new validated a thought in my mind that they COULD do something new and outside the realm of what I was familiar with. Many bands undergo metamorphoses that leave you looking but not recognizing what they are. Sure the footage really is of Neu! with Florian Schneider, but even that changed my vantage point. I didn’t know, no, I didn’t think he was capable of keeping up and adding something to that type of music, to the tunes. I thought of the music in such a mechanical, rigid way that seeing this long-haired German hippies totally wailing changed my own vantage points and approach to thinking about music. What this footage also did was give me fresh ears for listening to the LPs from that time frame. Midway through the song &#8220;Stratovarius&#8221; on <em>Kraftwerk</em> there is a churn I hadn’t heard or paid attention to before, the churn of a rhythm section, a churn I heard on the meeting of Kraftwerk and Neu!.</p>
<p>When I think of Kraftwerk I think of a standard bearer and an easy symbol, for Krautrock and beyond. I know that there were hundred of bands that you can label with that terminology. But I think Kraftwerk is the one people think of first yet I bet this music, is the last thing they would associate with the band. </p>
