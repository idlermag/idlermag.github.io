										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>The movie theatre is my home, and the idea that someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way is devastating to me.</em></p>
<p>&#8212; Christopher Nolan</p></blockquote>
<p>I saw <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> approximately 24 hours after the tragedy that occurred in Aurora, Colorado. I didn’t think twice when I purchased the tickets, even though I had heard about it all the way to work that Friday morning. It wasn’t until a security guard entered the theatre right after the house lights had dimmed and checked the emergency exits that I found my eyes and mind wandering. I scanned those same exits. I looked at the folks around me, especially those who had gotten up to leave. Returning with no concessions or evidence of purpose only sent my imagination off. I had to decide whether or not person X was likely to commit a violent act. Surely that old man here with his wife wouldn’t brandish a weapon? That group of guys? That mother of three?</p>
<p>Part of me was embarrassed that any of it had even crossed my mind. Aurora&#8217;s Cinema 16 security was not prepared for such a random act of violence precisely because it was unthinkable. To my knowledge, nothing like it had ever happened before. The last time I can recall any violence linked to a movie screening was in the early 90’s after the release of <em>New Jack City</em>. I confess to being ignorant as to whether or not any gun violence actually took place (mostly fights, if memory serves), but I feel confident in saying that no one was shot IN a theatre, and certainly not over 50 people. But yes, it has happened now and we tell ourselves we must do something so it can never happen again.</p>
<p>But we do not live in the world of <em>Minority Report</em>. We can&#8217;t predict individual acts of violence. We can only <em>react</em>. There isn’t a place we can go that will be completely and absolutely safe, but there are places where violence is far less likely to occur. The movie theatre should be one of them. I believe that it still is.</p>
<p>Time will tell, of course. This appears, so far, to have been the act of a lone and probably unbalanced individual. There will always be crazies. There will always be acts of random violence in public places. Are we to live in fear? Are we to walk out of our front doors every day expecting the worst? Of course not. But we feel the need to react. There must be something, anything that can be done.</p>
<p>I must admit to being pleased that the result hasn&#8217;t been a return to the argument that the film itself was responsible for inciting violence. We know that to be at best a gross oversimplification. Films themselves are reactions to the human experience. They hold up a mirror. It may be wiser to look at America’s appetite for violence. Violent films are made because they make money. A violent culture, or at least a culture with a taste for consuming violent images, leads to violent films, not the other way around.</p>
<p>There were more than a few scenes in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> that made my wife shield her eyes, all involving guns. I looked for her reaction because I was affected as well. But I did settle a bit as the film continued. I cannot pinpoint when, specifically, but I know that I eventually did what I had come to do &#8212; I watched a movie. And though the Aurora tragedy never fully left my mind, I was able to push it into the background. My hope is that in the future other moviegoers will be able to do the same, their fear dimming with the theatre lights, not forgotten, but not triumphant either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always been picky about when to buy and when not to buy a copy of a film. In the days before Netflix streaming, before Redbox and OnDemand, I would be so bold as to pick up a bargain bin film that I had never seen, but looked interesting. I am so old as to admit that that bargain bin film was probably on VHS, at least in the early goings. I lined my shelves. I bought previously-viewed films from the likes of Blockbuster and, showing my age even more, Mammoth video. Not only did I need to see everything, but I needed to display what I had seen like trophies.</p>
<p>Those days are long gone. Not solely because of the aforementioned home viewing options, but because I no longer have anything to prove. Recently, my wife even convinced me to put some of my DVDs away. Like, actually away. As in no longer in the line of sight. Growth is hard; growth is good.  My wife’s insistence that I stop burdening <em>all</em> of our living room shelves with my nerdom notwithstanding, I continued to purchase films, but with much more discernment. Instead of grabbing anything (and everything) I could, I made a point of only picking up films that inspired me, films with legitimate replay value, even if only in part. (I have been known to throw in a film just to watch one scene.) This new approach has made for a smaller, more purposeful collection. It’s also served to highlight my now seemingly archaic need to have something physical to reference.</p>
<p>In the age of streaming films and E-readers I still have shelves lined with DVDs and books. I had an easier time, I think, transitioning to an exclusively digital music collection because of my desire to have music with me at all times. CDs are cumbersome, an iPod is not. It’s been harder to make the transition elsewhere because, at least for me, the experience is as important as the thing itself. Books have a smell, a texture. In the completion of a page there is progress and physical evidence of it. I love bookstores. Love them. I could spend hours wandering the aisles of one, and have. Honestly, an E-reader just lacks character.</p>
<p>The same is true of film. Watching a movie that you chose (or in my case, settled on, watching only the first few minutes before wondering if I’d made a mistake, then choosing to give up on the idea all together) from an online menu isn’t anything. Busting out a copy of <em>Magnolia</em> intending to display and share in its brilliance, but instead ruining a party? Now that’s something. Going to a theatre? Now that’s even something-er. That’s an event. Even going to one of those dinosaur video rental places has got more going for it. At least you got off of the couch.</p>
<p>So I still have a ton of DVDs that I can’t yet bear to part with, even though some of them could surely go. I don’t really need an excuse to be lazy. I should get up and go to the movies, right? When I was a kid we used to walk ten miles through fifty feet of snow just to see a movie! Sometimes I feel old. Other times I worry that convenience will do away with the theatre experience the way that digital music has destroyed the album.</p>
