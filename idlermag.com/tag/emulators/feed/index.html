										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>EarthBound</em> is a challenging choice for the Gamers&#8217; Club for the same reason, hopefully, that it will be an interesting one. <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/09/13/earthbound-starting-blind/">Last week</a>, I wrote that playing <em>EarthBound</em> made one a member of an exclusive club, which is true mostly because the game itself is so hard to find. The only official release of <em>EarthBound</em> in the US was the Super Nintendo version from 1995. Unlike <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Dragon Quest</em>, <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, and, sometimes it seems, every other role-playing game ever released for the NES, SNES, or N64, <em>EarthBound</em> has never been re-released for another system. It&#8217;s not available on the Wii&#8217;s Virtual Console, and <a href="http://kotaku.com/5154779/this-might-be-why-we-dont-we-have-earthbound-on-virtual-console-yet" target="_blank">Kokatu.com doesn&#8217;t think it ever will be</a> (mostly because the music pays homage a little too closely to recognizable &#8212; and copyrighted &#8212; songs).</p>
<p>So in order to legally play the game, you have to dig up a working SNES machine, and shell out somewhat north of $100 for a working cartridge.</p>
<p>Or you can download a ROM and use one of the many excellent SNES emulators. Which I may or may not have done. Which in turn may or may not have led to the discovery that the many excellent Mac emulators don&#8217;t work with the Lion operating system. This may or may not have led me to download a new excellent emulator for my wife&#8217;s PC. (I also may or may not think that said hypothetical emulator isn&#8217;t quite as excellent as the emulator which I will neither confirm nor deny having used previously on my Mac.) Furthermore, I may or may not have discovered that my save file disappeared when my wife moved a set of files which may or may not have included an emulator from her desktop to a folder named &#8220;Gavin&#8217;s fun stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can, however, confirm that I have at this point that I&#8217;ve played the first 20 minutes of <em>EarthBound</em> three times. There&#8217;s not a lot of substance to say yet. I&#8217;m amused by the battle mechanics &#8212; in the first serious battle, with an enemy named &#8220;Starman Junior,&#8221; the battle party consists of Ness, his neighbors Picky and Pokey, and a bug named Buzz Buzz. Buzz Buzz, of course, is the most valuable member of the party, as he casts an impenetrable defensive spell (or &#8220;psionic&#8221;), and inflicts 100+ points of damage with his attacks. Ness, by contrast, inflicts 3-4 (that&#8217;s &#8220;three or four,&#8221; not &#8220;34&#8221;) points of damage per attack, and Picky and Pokey &#8220;apologize profusely&#8221; and &#8220;pretend to cry&#8221; by turns.</p>
<p>And then Buzz Buzz is squished, with hardly a thought, by Pokey&#8217;s mom. And he dies. Yeah.</p>
<p>I can see why Andrew <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-1R9">might find the whole thing a bit too cutsey</a>, and I&#8217;ll be interested to see if the battle mechanics are enough to hold my attention, or whether grinding with a broken bat as my weapon gets old really fast.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also looking forward to actually moving forward, rather than climbing that damn hill to find that meteor. Again.</p>
