										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robin McKinley&#8217;s <em>Dragonhaven</em> is set in Smokehill National Park somewhere out west, where the major draw is a population of <em>Draco australiensis</em> &#8212;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop there.</p>
<p>I love this novel about a national park with dragons, which is also a meditation on parenting, communication, and memory. The premise alone was enough to sell me on this 2007 novel by the author of a dozen or so smart, humane, chatty fantasy novels, but I&#8217;ll give you a little more detail to explain why I love it so much.</p>
<p>Jake Mendoza is the teenage son of the director of the dragon studies institute at Smokehill, a chronically underfunded, understaffed dragon reserve. Almost no one sees the dragons on the millions of acres of parkland; Smokehill rangers track dragon population by counting the casualties among wild sheep, deer, and bison. Smokehill also has a very strange dragon-proof (and more importantly, poacher-proof) fence. Jake and his father are both devastated by the death of Jake&#8217;s mother three years before on a dragon study sabbatical in Kenya (the world&#8217;s only preserves for the endangered dragons are at Smokehill, in Kenya, and in Australia, to which dragons are native. The detail in <em>Dragonhaven</em> on the rediscovery and near-extinction of dragons and the politics of protecting enormous, flying, endangered species is right on.)</p>
<p>The following happens in the first 50 pages of the book, so don&#8217;t fear spoilers. Jake is belatedly allowed to do his first solo hike in the park and stumbles upon a dragon. It&#8217;s not just a dragon, which he has never seen up close before, but a dragon who has just given birth, which no one in the records has ever seen. And not only that, the dragon is dying, shot by a poacher. These are all unthinkably strange things, but Jake is focused only on the surviving baby dragon, who he saves and tries to raise, despite knowing &#8212; because of that complicated legislative picture &#8212; that it&#8217;s illegal to save the life of a dragon.</p>
<p>The relationship between Jake and Lois the baby dragon and the serious parenting crash course Jake has to undertake (what do you feed a baby dragon and how do you keep it from burning you? How can you do anything else when she needs feeding every half hour?) is compelling and all-consuming and feels true. The book is structured as a memoir Jake is writing to explain the events at Smokehill to a national audience, and he explains that he was so short of sleep while raising Lois that some of those years were a blur. Jake&#8217;s voice really does feel like a teenager&#8217;s voice and it sells you on the story and its required suspensions of disbelief because you trust that it happened the way Jake said it, even if he didn&#8217;t understand the larger political ramifications.</p>
<p>There are excellent small observations: because it seems absurd to Jake to say “Good dragon, Lois” like he was talking to a dog, he says “Hot stuff, Lois!” as a praise-phrase. And it&#8217;s exactly right that interspecies telepathy would cause terrible headaches.</p>
<p>If the book had a different cover I could see it being sold as a thrilling adventure novel, or as a touching book about parents and children. As it is, look for it in the young adult section of your bookstore or library.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Melina Marchetta is an Australian writer well known for her YA novels set in Catholic high schools (the wonderful <em>Saving Francesca</em> is a frequent reread.) She also won the Printz, a high honor for YA books, for <em>Jellicoe Road</em>, a book I found so sad that I haven&#8217;t ever picked it up for a second read. But in the last decade she turned her well-tuned characterization and plotting skills to fantasy, writing <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em>, my recommendation for your summer reading.</p>
<p>It is my contention that some of the best recent high fantasy is about trauma and recovery from trauma. Novels of wars between low-tech nations and their rulers are an excellent place to think about personal and social trauma; a writer can enlarge the boundaries of traumatic events so widely that it becomes impossible to think that these events would <em>not</em> have repercussions in individual characters&#8217; lives. In realistic fiction and in our own lives it&#8217;s a lot easier to bury a hugely traumatic event and assume that a character is over it, but when the entire kingdom suffers we cannot. In fact, in <em>Finnikin</em> the movement from silence to speaking together about horrible experiences is an important narrative trajectory. I&#8217;m not saying that <em>Finnikin</em> is very dark, but it is about recovery. (Another excellent example of this is Kristin Cashore&#8217;s Graceling novels.)</p>
<p>When <em>Finnikin</em> opens we find the eponymous main character, a young man, on his usual pursuits: going through the land looking for help for his exiled people and for information about both the dead and the possibly living &#8212; could the heir survive? Ten years before, Lumatere, a small, peaceful kingdom at the confluence of trade routes, had been invaded by troops from the north. Lumaterans blamed a magic-wielding minority for their troubles and began to persecute them. In response to their cruelties, at her death at the stake the priestess Seranonna cursed Lumatere, shutting it off entirely from the rest of the world. Those who were able to flee the country were shut out, unable to contact their “lost beloveds.” An impenetrable cloud lay over Lumatere.</p>
<p>Finnikin&#8217;s self-imposed work is the keeping of the <em>Book of Lumatere</em>, recording who was lost &#8212; at the closing of Lumatere, in massacres at refugee camps, of the plague &#8212; and who stayed alive. He also has been working with the kingdom&#8217;s former head courtier to convince other countries to offer a piece of land to the exiled Lumaterans. But when they meet a young woman who says she knows where the heir might be, their plans have to change.</p>
<p>I particularly like that in this book, after what might in a more conventional novel be the ending, Marchetta makes us stay with the characters and learn how they move together toward wholeness, understanding, and &#8212; dare I say &#8212; happiness. (This paragraph made intentionally vague to avoid spoilers.)</p>
<p>The sequel, <em>Froi of the Exiles</em>, was published a number of years ago in Australia but is now available in bookstores here. I haven&#8217;t read it yet, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m recommending for my own summer reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was growing up, my dad spoke fondly about the time in his life when he reread his favorite book, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, once a year. “On an exceptionally hot evening in July,” he would quote in a funny voice, imitating a friend who didn&#8217;t get his love for the book, “a young man came out of his garret on S Place and walked slowly toward K Bridge&#8211;what is this stuff?” But during the 1970s, he made a point of reading the book every year.</p>

It&#8217;s <em>Little, Big</em>, by John Crowley, a sprawling fantasy family saga. Sometime during the summer, some hot and languorous week, I have a strong sense that it&#8217;s time. I drop the five other books I&#8217;m in the middle of, find a place to read and a bowl of apples, and return to the story. I haven&#8217;t memorized the first line like my dad did with his book, but <em>Little, Big</em> starts with Smoky Barnable walking from the City to the house called Edgewood to get married. Alice (called Daily Alice) Drinkwater is waiting. She takes a bath in Edgewood&#8217;s Gothic Bathroom, with stained glass and a stone tub (this is an indelible image for me). And the story goes inward and outward.</p>
<p><em>Little, Big</em> is subtitled, in the style of Victorian novels, <em>The Fairies&#8217; Parliament, </em>and it is indeed an exploration of the sympathetic magic between world and person, Word and utterance, wood and bird. The family story of the Drinkwaters is implicated in a magico-political rebuilding of America. A heartbroken young man builds a memory palace. Alice&#8217;s great-uncle photographs fairies in the bottom of the garden. Edgewood&#8217;s rusty orrery grinds back to orbit. The title reminds you to be attentive to the echoes of “as above, so below” throughout Smoky and Alice&#8217;s family story.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised, really, that I can&#8217;t recite the first line, because while the book&#8217;s language is beautiful, lyrical, and deliberate, I experience it after so many rereads as a sequence of dream images. When I reread <em>Little, Big</em> I fall back into them. I read for the images I can&#8217;t forget &#8212; and for unremembered images so vivid I&#8217;m amazed I could forget them. Every time I reread I&#8217;m struck by an incident involving a changeling that I find so terrifying that I block it out, just like the characters do. The structure is cyclical, too, so that I know that the story will turn back, like the paths in the private walled garden in the novel. I haven&#8217;t reread <em>Little, Big </em>yet this summer, but soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a certain day in June, 19&#8211;, a young man was making his way on foot northward from the great City to a town or place called Edgewood, that he had been told of but had never visited. His name was Smoky Barnable, and he was going to Edgewood to get married; the fact that he walked but did not ride was one of the conditions placed on his coming there at all.</p></blockquote>
