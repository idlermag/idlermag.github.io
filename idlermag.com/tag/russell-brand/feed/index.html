										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve all seen those little segments on fluffy morning “news” shows or the similar comparative layouts in fitness magazines &#8212; those ones that urge you to substitute one high-calorie meal for a delicious but healthier alternative. Eat this, not that, they say. You can have a black coffee, sausage sandwich and an orange for the same amount of calories as one of your syrup-soaked, chocolate drizzled, bucket-sized, morning drinks! Do it! Your waistline will thank you!</p>
<p>I present to you a list with a similar idea, only I’m breaking it down for you hottie-style.  &#8220;Date This, Not That&#8221; features those awesome pop culture dudes that get your blood boiling along with more sensible alternatives that will be much better for you.  Carry these lessons into your dating life and feel free to thank me effusively and with gifts later.*</p>

Are you crazy for that muscle-bound frame, that rebellious nature, and those dangerously sexy out-of-this-world meathooks? Well, I love a mutton-chopped jerk as much as the next hipster, but why put up with all that boundless rage and those damn commitment issues when you could find the best in Beast?  Date Henry “Beast” McCoy and you get all the fur with none of the cur!  Erudite vocab, sweet spectacles, and fine manners?  A relationship with this guy will surely last longer than a fling with ol’ Logan.  Beast still has all that animal magnetism going for him, but with this X-Man you can chat about Mozart, Faulkner and molecular biology and stuff.  He’s super agile, so um, use that as you will, and to please your bubby, he’s a doctor!</p>

As Klausner sees it, the strong, confident and vocal Piggies of the world are ready to karate chop their way through the glass ceiling at work and through the gendered song and dance of dating.  Piggy doesn’t mind asking Kermit out, planning the date and paying for it.  She’s a pig of the millennium.  The problem comes when Kermie rarely gives anything back.  He’s content to play his banjo and endlessly obsess about his shows—us satin-gloved gals deserve more care and attention.  </p>

Sweetums, a giant hairy monster, if not the most articulate or finely dressed fella, shares your smash-any-obstacle aggressive approach to life.  Gonzo, though weird and at times annoying is doting, poetic, a romantic.  And my favorite, Scooter, is an organized nerd with a snappy retro sense of style.  This kid has drive (he always makes sure the show is running on time and everyone’s in place) and he shares much of the Weezer-esque qualities of our pal Kermit.  Explore your many options and remember to tell yourself, “Only the best for moi.” </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Don’t date any of these guys.  Just don’t.  Not even Vinnie.</p>

The freckles, the oxfords, that smoking hot ginger sex appeal.  I get it, gf.  But he’s so indecisive and he plays the field.  One week he’s ga-ga for Ronnie, the next he’s letting Betty cook him a romantic meal.  And that jalopy, well, it isn’t exactly the raddest ride in Riverdale.   </p>
<p>What to do?  Reggie is stuck up and jerky, Jughead lacks (non-food-related) motivation, Moose is a sporto and that’s not your bag.  Well, I suggest the Bettys and the Veronicas try dating each other.  You’re already best gal pals and who knows, maybe all that competitiveness and girl drama is covering up a latent attraction.  Seriously, you’ve been chasing Mr. Andrews for 71 years &#8212; it’s not happening.   </p>

<p>Give him a try, too, and report back with copious notes.  </p>
<p>I hope this swapping lesson has been instructive.  Go forth, and may you find your potential mate!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*Full Disclosure, I am married to a ginormous red-head whose goals in life include: 1. Garnering more wizard power than Gandalf himself, 2. Getting better at Lovecraftian alchemy and 3. Probably nothing else because he is “already awesome.”  So, maybe don’t take my advice.  It’s not a science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve seen Chris Isaak’s &#8220;Wicked Game.&#8221; You’ve seen Christina Aguilera’s &#8220;Dirrty.&#8221; I have too. And they’re peachy&mdash;along with Prince’s &#8220;Gett Off,&#8221; which is also swell&mdash;but for my favorite saucy music video eye candy, I prefer something a little more left-of-center. Perhaps you do too. Perhaps you’d be interested to see some hot people in drag who spit ferocity and passion, or who have body hair and pores. People who roll around on the stage screaming and sweating, or who smolder while barely moving at all. If so, you can proceed below to a list of the offbeat, non-pop music videos and clips that I have deemed überhot with my special sexy wand.</p>
<p><strong>#10. I’m so messed up, I want you here</strong></p>
<p>There is an infamous 1991 performance of &#8220;I Wanna Be Your Dog&#8221; by Iggy Pop, post-Stooges, which took place in the Paris Olympia music hall in France. At the end of that performance, Pop gets his lad out. I’m not kidding. As Patrick Stewart would say, “You see everything.”</p>
<p>I obliviously bought a bootleg of this concert on VHS in ’92 or ’93, when I was fifteen or sixteen and already a big Iggy Pop / Stooges fan. So imagine me with my purple hair and motorcycle boots, blithely watching Iggy Pop writhe and spasm across the stage, all the while innocently thinking, “Wow, Iggy Pop is so kewl.” And then suddenly down go his jeans and out comes his entire John Thomas, and my gum falls out of my mouth like Short Round in <em>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</em>.</p>
<p>I can’t in good conscience post that version here where other young people might see it, but I did locate this lovely short clip that aired on the <em>Old Grey Whistle Test</em> program on BBC2 in 1979, where Iggy is still all writhey, shirtless sinew, as per usual. Rawr.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbLRf0j80wUfs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#9. I’m his alibi</strong></p>
<p>John Waters has made films that are absolutely filthy. But he’s also made a couple family-friendly-ish ones like <em>Hairspray</em> (1988) and <em>Cry-Baby</em> (1990). <em>Cry-Baby</em> starred Johnny Depp fresh off <em>21 Jump Street</em>, and happens to boast my all-time favorite, cheesecake-sexy, PG-rated musical number.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTu75hLSiU4fs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#8. Time, in quaaludes and red wine</strong></p>
<p>BOW-IE. The man himself. He’s like a Sara Lee pound cake: “Nobody doesn’t like David Bowie.” He has performed many swoon-worthy songs over the years, but few as sensual and unusual as the televised <em>Midnight Special Floor Show</em> performance of &#8220;Time,&#8221; filmed in 1973 and aired in 1980.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROmdX7hXDdEfs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#7. Kiss us hard on the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Regina Spektor can do no wrong in my book—she’s absolutely magical. This country song off her new <em>Live In London</em> Blu-ray is a departure form her usual fare, but oh so good and unique; just like her.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLaztkfbA24fs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#6. Caught it off the back of a toilet seat</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most mainstream clip on this list, but boy do I love me some Russell Brand. The song is a rock-parody about venereal disease from the film <em>Get Him to the Greek</em>, but it’s actually really catchy (no pun intended). It is indeed Brand doing his own singing, and fake-rock-star Russell Brand makes me go all moo-eyed. Work-safe except for one little bit, but it’s short. Just pretend it isn’t there. “These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.” And by droids, I mean boobs.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-wrYqX_8Scfs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#5. The world is watching as I get undressed</strong></p>
<p>There was some kerfuffle recently over a Daisy Chainsaw song being used in a <em>Gossip Girl</em> trailer, and some people my age who held the 90s anthem &#8220;Love Your Money&#8221; close to their hearts got their indie cred in a twist. I say good for KatieJane Garside—the Daisy Chainsaw frontwoman—and the rest of the band. This means a royalty check for them, as well as potential new listeners. I have always felt they deserved a wider audience. And as an artist friend so astutely pointed out: “If you really like someone’s work, you won&#8217;t oppose them earning enough to afford health insurance.”</p>
<p>The members of Daisy Chainsaw regrouped in 2000 to form the cathartic, very sexy and very raw QueenAdreena. Some days, we all wish for a hole to scream into. Most of us can’t, so KatieJane does it for us.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/oqERBkwBSsYfs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#4. Now, fetch this</strong></p>
<p>The Cramps have been called &#8220;greasy,&#8221; &#8220;sleazy,&#8221; and &#8220;throbbing.&#8221; They are legendary and should need no introduction, but just in case: they are the originators of psychobilly music. However, even that description barely scratches the surface of the innovation and influence they have brought to all punk, goth and rockabilly musicians who’ve followed them.</p>
<p>The Cramps’ lead singer Lux Interior was his own carnal, alien cocktail, with just enough bottle-breaking, androgynous swagger to make him that much more appealing as he growled and gyrated with the microphone inside his mouth. He had a 37-year relationship with wife and Cramps lead guitarist Poison Ivy until his untimely death two years ago. RIP, Lux. This live appearance on the British television show <em>The Tube</em> is from 1986.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDjHDmL3Kp0fs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#3. We’ll get naked and—</strong></p>
<p>This one is the raunchiest video on the list (so have a stiff drink first; it’s worth it), by alternative dance band Morningwood. Lead singer Chantal Claret—who is married to Mindless Self Indulgence singer Jimmy Urine—was also apparently on Oprah when she was nine years old. Crazy. She is so rockin’ and so fine, it hurts.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kYLImd8_Xcfs1hlen_US?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>#2. Get down, get down, little Henry Lee</strong></p>
<p>Much of what I’ve listed here is bawdy, but it’s not like I don’t have a heart too—quite a big one, in fact; I just keep it well-concealed beneath my bawdy exterior. But this video just rends my heart in two. If a performance makes you want to go make out with the person you love and also weep at the same time, you know it’s got something special, ‘cause that’s hard to pull off simultaneously. It’s said that Nick Cave and PJ Harvey fell in love right before our eyes during this shoot. Dunno if that’s true, but damn it makes good copy, and after watching this—I’d believe it. Thanks to <em>Idler</em> music columnist <a href="http://idler-mag.com/author/mvdysphonia/">Mike Vincent</a> for reminding me about this one.   Henry Lee &#8211; Nick Cave &amp; PJ Harvey</p>

<p><strong>#1. When you only sleep with girls who say they like your music</strong></p>
<p>Oh dear, the Dresden Dolls. I can’t get enough of them or enough of singer Amanda Palmer’s now-solo work. She and Dresden Dolls drummer Brian Viglione are a jaw-dropping duo who had great musical chemistry, as evidenced in this stupendously sexy video. Palmer is now married to author Neil Gaiman, who apart from being an amazing writer, must also be quite an exceptional man to have snagged her.</p>

<p>I am a bit late to the Russell Brand boat, I think. My brushes with current pop culture are piecemeal and oddball, and mainstream stuff tends to pass me by. Although Russell Brand is only recently mainstream, I think. At least in America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first saw Brand in what I believe were the commercials for his 2008 hosting of the MTV Music Video Awards. My reaction was, &#8220;Wow, that guy is really, really hot,&#8221; and I didn’t consider much more beyond that. If I think a man is hot, I assume he will also be a d-bag. This in no way reflects anything about the men I cast these aspersions on, but instead says loads about my own secret preconceptions.</p>
<p>So apart from random sightings here and there, I didn’t run into Brand again until I saw <em>Hop</em> (2011), a movie which I went to see solely because it had bunnies, and a movie which I think would’ve not worked nearly as well if it weren’t for Brand’s voicing of the main &#8220;bunneh.&#8221; I was smitten. &#8220;Who is this guy?!&#8221; I thought. Hello, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand" target="new">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brand has been a vegetarian since the age of 14&#8230; describ[es] himself as looking like an &#8220;SM Willy Wonka&#8230;&#8221; he has suffered from bulimia, and also went through a period of self harm&#8230; Brand is a former heroin, sex addict, and a recovering alcoholic.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was intrigued. This reflects even more about my unseemly personal fixations.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4982" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/04/13/pee-pee-envy-the-hot-and-heartbreaking-sexual-appeal-of-russell-brand/brand-booky-wook-cover/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/brand-booky-wook-cover.jpg" data-orig-size="294,460" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="brand-booky-wook-cover" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/brand-booky-wook-cover.jpg?w=192" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/brand-booky-wook-cover.jpg?w=294" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4982" title="brand-booky-wook-cover" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/brand-booky-wook-cover.jpg?w=191&#038;h=300" alt="Booky Wook" width="191" height="300" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/brand-booky-wook-cover.jpg?w=191&amp;h=300 191w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/brand-booky-wook-cover.jpg?w=96&amp;h=150 96w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/brand-booky-wook-cover.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 191px) 100vw, 191px" /> By chance last week, I ran across Brand’s 2007 memoir, <em>My Booky Wook</em> (the British edition, which has a much prettier cover than the American version, by the way), so I picked it up. And here is where I officially fell in love:</p>
<blockquote><p>We all have an essential self, but if you spend every day chopping up meat on a slab, and selling it by the pound, soon you’ll find you’ve become a butcher. And if you don’t want to become a butcher (and why would you?), you’re going to have to cut right through to the bare bones of your own character in the hope of finding out who you really are. Which bloody hurts.</p></blockquote>
<p>You might think that a memoir written by a man which has a predominant focus on promiscuous sex with women would not be relatable to a woman. And perhaps I am not a typical woman (okay, I am definitely not a typical woman), but I have rarely read writing about this particular type of sexuality that I could so thoroughly relate to. In fact, only one time did I encounter a person whose sexuality I understood more, and that time, I moved in with him.</p>
<p>The aspect of wanting to be needed and needing to be wanted and misguidedly searching for self-esteem through sex has been extensively chronicled in writing about women’s sexuality. But not so much the eroticism or pleasure-seeking that can sometimes exist alongside it; making the whole foray all the more difficult to navigate. With so much emphasis on how damaged women use sex as a substitute for acceptance or affection, or how casual sex is detrimental to women’s self esteem—all things which are absolutely and completely true—the visceral factor of how actual desire and libido play into self-destructive sex is somehow ignored in women’s sex studies. I don’t think these feelings are absent for women; I think they are unaccounted for. I think women don’t talk about them because 1.) Other women aren’t talking about them, and 2.) Whenever women say they might maybe, possibly be horny, they know they are opening themselves up to be a target for men who take any show of sexuality as consent for any sexual activity, with anyone. You know, even if the woman is kicking and screaming and trying to get away. Because the world is shitty like that.</p>

It would be sexist of me to suggest that a male has a somehow closer understanding of fringe female sexuality because he has an eating disorder and self-harm in his history, afflictions more commonly found in women. Although it may be worth examining once you realize you’re looking at the cause and effect backwards: the feelings are precursive to the behavior of these self-inflicted afflictions, not the other way around. Feelings of worthlessness and aloneness, of abandonment and wanting to be saved.</p>
<p>I also think it does Brand a disservice to imply that the way he experiences feelings about sex are in any way female, because his sexuality is very decidedly male (hubba!), and I don’t believe all sex motivations necessarily need to be gendered in that way. But I’m willing to bet that women who’ve had complicated sexual lives will read the things he says and go, &#8220;Dude, I feel you, man. I so do.&#8221; Which can really only serve to get him laid even more (I know he’s married now to Katy Perry—I’m just sayin’).</p>
<p>And from a comic aspect, Brand’s sex humor is also somehow more inclusive than many other male comedians, even though it’s no less vulgar and rude. The way Denis Leary talked about orgasms in his <em>Lock N Load</em> show, for instance, felt very segregating to the sexes. I don’t even mean there’s anything wrong with that; there will always be a place in comedy for that type of gender differentiating humor, both for men and women. But Brand’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEUpm3tSx5w" target="new">routine about the differences in the pre-ejaculatory versus the post-ejaculatory mindsets</a> in his <em>Russell Brand: Live in New York</em> show was so refreshingly universal. His bit about &#8220;seagulling&#8221; had me tearing up from laughter and joy, with the feeling that, &#8220;Man, somebody gets it.&#8221; It’s unsurprising to hear that Brand was raised by his mother and grew up chiefly around women. Someone who can talk about desiring women in a way that’s very base but also extremely respectful is walking a pretty impressive, modern and complex tightrope. You go, Russell—Go on my son.</p>
