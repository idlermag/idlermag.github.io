										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Facebook &#8212; it’s the worst, right?!  It makes you lonelier, fatter, stupider, uglier, monosyllabic-er, etc. Every day there’s another study, another headline, another TV news segment about how awful and addicting this horrible site is.  Every day I see people (on Facebook usually) snarking about other people’s usage of FB or even (bless their hearts) swearing it off.  This is all fine.  Really it is.  And all the reasons why people complain about FB are probably smart and valid.  Facebook clearly simplifies our connections down to clicks and LOLs.  It both encourages us to overshare our most mundane activities and undershare meaningful time with flesh-and-blood people.  Yet, in all our hating of this FacePlace of ours and Zuckerberg’s, we might be missing some of the positivity that virtually inhabiting such a space can create.</p>
<p>Now, in the rhetoric of our social media “everyone’s a celebrity” culture, here’s my very important story about how Facebook is meaningful to ME.  You may commence eyeroll, but do keep reading.</p>
<p>Embarrassingly, I’ve always been a people pleaser to the point of doormat-ism.  I would gladly let anyone walk all over me if it meant winning their friendship and securing their approval.  In college, I recall suffering a bit of an identity crisis when I realized that given a simple decision (what to wear, what to buy, what to eat, who to date) I’d freeze up, panicked and at a loss. Did I like that movie? Would I wear those jeans?  I had no idea. Pushed to actually rely upon some internal reaction, some meter in my gut that measured desire, I’d find that I had nothing there except an overwhelming wish to be right, be normal, be exactly whatever other people wanted.  This, of course, is difficult when placed in the presence of multiple people.  </p>
<p><em>He</em> hates Pearl Jam. </p>
<p>But <em>she</em> loves them.</p>
<p>What do YOU think?!</p>
<p>I think I’m peeing my pants and having a heart attack, is what I think.  I cannot possibly continue this conversation and have to go cry, now. Thanks for inviting me to this kegger!  Goodbye, good time friends!  </p>
<p>Dramatic?  Maybe.  Was my social anxiety and need for acceptance that warped and wacky? Definitely.</p>
<p>Somewhere in me I knew what I was about, but I was always so terrified that being myself &#8212; my own weird, silly, smart, and nerdy self &#8212; would never be enough for others. Though I’ve outgrown this sad state quite a bit with time and painful real life experience, presenting myself authentically (whatever that means) remains difficult. Ironically, I find that Facebook, this internet non-place, becomes a useful tool for pushing toward realness.  Yes, we can tweak our status updates and erase information, photoshop pictures and lie in so many fun ways online, but the physical distance from face-to-face encounters and the reliance upon writing that comes part and parcel with using social media also creates a comfortable zone in which to practice being myself.  As an introvert, I can throw ideas, jokes, and opinions out into the ether &#8212; things I might think quietly to myself or whisper to a close friend in “the real world” &#8212; and I can deal with the responses in my own time and space.  The risk feels smaller because I won’t have to nervously wait for a laugh at my quip. If someone disagrees, I have time to think, assess, formulate an answer.  In more typically social scenarios I might just bend to my audience; on FB I can push myself to keep it real, be a little bit braver.  </p>
<p>One could argue that I’m taking a “fake it ‘til you make it” approach, and yes, to some degree this is true.  Like most folks, I’m writing and constructing an online persona that is not 100% tangible.  Much of this “me” is built out of wishes and fantasy.  However, a great portion of this persona is also getting at, unearthing, a me inside that’s quite real and viable but covered up.  This me is angry, strong, unwilling to put up with bullshit.  She’s the one that hates being catcalled, the one that wants to go up to that catcaller and eviscerate him with a feminist diatribe that castrates his will to yell.  She’s also incredibly emotional and okay with this.  She wants to preach empathy, teach everyone that people and relationships matter, that listening takes many shapes.  She’s funny.  She wants to be playful, childish.  Her head’s full of silly songs, she performs operatic renditions of &#8220;Froggy Went a Ridin’&#8221; while taking a shower.  She loves puppy pictures. . . like, a lot.  But that pretty much squares with all versions of myself, I suppose.  Anyway, all these selves have a little more room to breathe, grow, figure themselves out, and go public on Facebook.  I have to dare myself to be as true as I can be, and sometimes, yes, I worry and bite my nails over the backlash, the gossip, the whispers that will come in response.  </p>
<p>Ugh, can she take <em>another</em> picture of herself?  Vain!</p>
<p>Complaining about patriarchy again? Feminazi!</p>
<p>Telling her sad sap life story again? Selfish!</p>
<p>And sometimes I get those negative responses crystal clearly on my page or passive-aggressively in my feed and I’m forced to deal with them and this is good.  Having this place where my audience is not only my closest friends, but colleagues, old teachers, family, strangers, I can’t possibly cater to them all and I’m further forced to find the shape my self takes and can take.  With each post I can push my role of daughter and sister, teacher and friend, writer and feminist out of its comfort zone and hopefully, with this stage set, I can outgrow the limits that the scary, judgey, immediate “real world” presents for me and better represent that online me I really like.</p>
<p>Is Facebook a timesuck?  Yes.  Is it evil in many ways? For sure. But if you’re telling me that I’d be better off in olden days with my sick sad lonely scared self, I’m not buying.  Yes, I could have hermited myself away and written glorious poems to my depressive wounds and people could enjoy my posthumous diaries &#8212; neat!  But, I’d rather FB friend all the modern day Emily Dickensons, build a group page, share our poems, and maybe one day, if we’re really feeling up to it, go out and warm our pallid bodies in the delicious sunshine. Or just continue to chat from home for a while, because, to me, that’s fine, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living in a college town, when you are still young enough to occasionally be confused with the undergrads and happen to be a grad student yourself (even though you are going to school on nights and weekends while holding down a full-time job), it&#8217;s not easy to admit this. In fact, what I am about to disclose doesn&#8217;t seem to go over well when you fall into the category of single at any sexually viable age.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to drink.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like going to the bar. I especially dislike it when someone asks me to meet them for drinks as part of the dating process. It isn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t appreciate good alcohol, because I do. A well-mixed cocktail with a house-made infusion is something I&#8217;m likely to order while out to dinner. I&#8217;ve spent a shameful amount of money on fine scotch. I enjoy trying microbrews. In my apartment, there are usually several bottles in the wine rack, a few beer options in the fridge, and a prominent liquor selection displayed near my entryway. But I have a confession. The same beer sits in my fridge for months unless I have people over. The bottles of wine collect dust until I have company, too. I bought the liquor because I find the bottles aesthetically pleasing and they reflect light nicely on this antique mirrored tray I found, especially with the set of cut crystal tumblers I have. </p>
<p>Alcohol is something that I like the idea of more than I like the reality of. A cold beer on a hot summer day at the ballpark can be wonderful&mdash;for the first sip. If I have the entire beer instead of a water, and we are sitting in the sun, I am going to still want the water and end up with an instant headache, then need to miss part of the game to wait in line to pee. The delicious pitcher of sangria split over conversation with a friend will invariably leave me massively hung over the next morning. Hung over means more than vaguely uncomfortable anymore. It means water-retention: bloating and visible puffiness in the face. It means a splitting, sneaky late-afternoon headache after I thought I had gotten away unscathed. My tolerance was definitely higher as a college student that imbibed regularly, but I am starting to wonder if at some point I just accepted these discomforts without question because they seemed merely a part of the cycle and the process in that particular social environment. So maybe I simply chose not to be in tune with what it does to my whole system. With adult responsibilities, I certainly notice it now. My free time is invaluable, and I don&#8217;t want to spend hours that I could sneak in a workout or thoroughly enjoy a new book curled up on the couch, half-interested in a shitty movie and sipping Alka-Seltzer.</p>
<p>My reasons go well beyond this, though. What I&#8217;ve offered thus far is just the easiest explanation.</p>
<p>Recreational drinking is a lot like recreational eating. We have social norms about sharing food and meeting for drinks&mdash;they tend to be the two default options for spending time with other people. They both tend to result in over-indulgence and offer a buffer for the actual visit. Eating and drinking both give you something to do with your hands and your mouth that cut down on awkward silences and give you a sense of purpose in the moment. I am eating. I am drinking. There is less pressure to just talk, because you are also doing something functional.</p>
<p>Alcohol isn&#8217;t good for you. There are studies that show that a glass of wine can actually be good for your heart, or that hops have nutritional benefits. Well, other safely ingested items also contain these beneficial properties without all of the empty calories. It&#8217;s never going to be the best choice for any form of health benefit. Alcohol is a simple carbohydrate. It gets converted to fat quickly if the energy isn&#8217;t used immediately. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t tend to pre-drink as a warm-up for exercise. I tend to drink while seated. I tend to remain seated until I decide I am unfit for public and need to retire to bed. In the past, there was sometimes the activity of embarrassing dancing or inadvisable horizontal recreation, but now I prefer to be sober for those endeavors. Crazy, I know. Truth be told, I find awkwardness very revealing, and often endearing. If you can&#8217;t weather the potential discomfort of being naked, literally or metaphorically, then you should probably not be doing certain things in the first place.</p>
<p>All of this said, it is a challenge to sidestep drinking as soon as you are of legal age. The bar is where people tend to want to meet, especially singles. Ordering drinks with dinner has some tag of hipness attached to it, like you never quite get over the assertion that you CAN order alcohol. And I am finding that the peer pressure associated with drinking is strikingly similar to the people you know who are likely to passively sabotage your attempts at healthy eating or portion control. It often comes from those same people. They want to imbibe and they would feel more comfortable if you did, too. Or they don&#8217;t want to go out alone. </p>
<p>Drinking alone and eating alone are similarly seen as pitiable by those that would never dream of doing either if at all avoidable. I have never really enjoyed drinking alone, but I live alone so lo and behold, most of my meals occur alone. One has to eat. In the process of these meals consumed in solitude, there has been a healthy shift away from seeing eating as a social event and starting to connect food more with fuel. But it means that I am getting protective of my routine and it can be really difficult for me to be confronted with the food issues of others because I have worked so hard to address my own. It is not always easy to prevent your decisions about food from being influenced by those around you. Someone orders dessert and it makes you feel entitled to it, too, even though you are already full to bursting. . . someone asks you to share dessert so you feel like a party pooper declining. . . same with appetizers. Or shots at the bar. Do you really want to be the lame one? The answer for me is becoming a resounding YES 90% of the time. Part of me can&#8217;t wait to grow into the middle-aged woman with the confidence to make these decisions and choose not to notice how they make others uncomfortable. You know why it makes other people uncomfortable? If you actively choose to do the right thing for you, they are confronted for a moment with whether or not it is actually the wisest choice for them, too. And if someone is trying to cut loose, they don&#8217;t want to consider that.</p>
