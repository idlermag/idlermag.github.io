										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Self-evident fact number one: women like sports, and as such, we watch sports on television.</p>
<p>And, yeah, we get that far less than zero percent of all advertising or promotional marketing is aimed at us. </p>
<p>Which is fine. I don&#8217;t need a pink Detroit Tigers cap, or a pink baseball shaped keychain, or a pink whatever &#8212; even though I really do like the color pink and its various incarnations. </p>

The hero, a football-loving man (the audience is always assumed to be male), is so oppressed by his wife&#8217;s relentless nagging that we (more men) are meant to empathize with him and root for him when he, say, leaves his wife off the guest list for the party in their home.</p>
<p>Oh, and the home is now full of hot bitches drinking some frosty beer, natch. </p>
<p>Fine. Maybe most male sports fans aren&#8217;t &#8220;fan&#8221; enough to watch an entire telecast without the requisite tit shots to hold their attention. Or perhaps Coors really does get a huge bump in sales from men watching these games and living under such horrific matriarchal regimes &#8212; who knows.</p>
<p>What I do know is that, when my friends (ladies) and I watch sports, we somehow manage to make it through the entire event without some scrotal cleavage being dangled along the sidelines to keep us too transfixed to turn away. </p>
<p>Yet I cannot attend or watch any major sporting event (save international soccer) without having some half-naked woman tossed out and bobbed along the sidelines like a lure on a fishing line. The USC sweater girls? The endless NCAA tourney upskirts? The barely-contained silicon juggernauts of Tampa Bay and Dallas, ass hanging out from booty shorts? Even hockey has them &#8212; the ladies in (what else?) booty shorts and midriff-baring mini-team-tanks scooping up piles of ice shavings.</p>

<p>And what do we get? Well, we get no reprieve. We get the same sweaty ass of the nose tackle, his jock strap clearly visible through his soaked white pants. We get David Beckham puking. We get men at their sweatiest, and most disgusting. Sometimes, if we&#8217;re lucky, they&#8217;ll have interesting facial hair or spectacular muscles.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be honest here: women do not watch sports for the eye candy. Perhaps men don&#8217;t, either, but they get the eye candy as a bizarre reward for watching something they should be fan enough to watch anyway. </p>
<p>My point being: it was bad enough before.</p>
<p>Now, we have this. </p>

<p>Now, every broadcast of Tigers games on Fox Sports Detroit &#8212; which otherwise does a fair job of avoiding the &#8220;now watch this jiggle&#8221; sports marketing trend &#8212; features these women, either in the stands or in some thirty-second vignette delivering a stilted, generic monologue about baseball. &#8220;I still remember my first game.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. I exaggerate, but you get the point. If the essay question were, tell me about a cherished memory, and that were your answer, you&#8217;d fail. And that&#8217;s what this whole bullshit campaign is: a fail.</p>
<p>First, it completely insults any fan &#8212; male, female, gay or straight &#8212; who watches baseball just because they like baseball. It&#8217;s the equivalent of your boss giving you a gold star for showing up to work and speaking to you like a kindergartner. It&#8217;s like being spoken to as if you were a puppy: &#8220;Aw, there&#8217;s a good boy! You stayed with us after the commercial break. Now watch me smile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, it adds nothing to the game. There&#8217;s a big difference between Erin Andrews &#8212; who is insanely hot but also a fucking good journalist with stellar credentials who actually worked her way up &#8212; and these two, &#8220;Lauren&#8221; and &#8220;Allison,&#8221; whose only qualifications for the &#8220;job&#8221; seem to be being attractive, photogenic, and craving attention from somewhat famous dudes. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re worse than cheerleaders, who have athletic talent and are victims of creepy cameramen and gross color commentators. They&#8217;re worse than the hockey girls, who, scantily clad and overly made-up though they are, still perform the valuable service of cleaning the ice. </p>
<p>This? This is pandering. This is insulting. It&#8217;s John McCain choosing Sarah Palin. It&#8217;s the slow-motion running sequences of Pam Anderson on Baywatch. It&#8217;s the worst of every other sport, made more ludicrous. </p>
<p>This is baseball, assholes. And I prefer mine without the barely-concealed message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like to think of myself as someone with a good sense of humor.  I “get” comedy stylings ranging from Andy Kauffman’s violent vignettes of discomfort  to Andy Samberg’s dormitory humor.   Lucy and Ethel to Roseanne.  Carlin, Chappelle and Cho?  Seen them all live.  Okay, I do draw the line of funny with certain figures&mdash;I can’t stand that man with the grumpy puppets or Dane Cook or Larry the Cable Guy, but I can definitely understand how these comedians could be funny to somebody else.  Do I wonder about those people?  Yes.  But I withhold judgment as best I can.  Still, in all my benevolent comedic open-mindedness I fail to be wooed by the most recent comedic trend: laughing at and loving our nation’s favorite winner, Charlie Sheen.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_4591" style="width: 419px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4591" data-attachment-id="4591" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/23/on-winning-and-losing-it/charlie-sheen-tour-poster/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/charlie-sheen-tour-poster.jpg" data-orig-size="409,533" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="charlie-sheen-tour-poster" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/charlie-sheen-tour-poster.jpg?w=230" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/charlie-sheen-tour-poster.jpg?w=409" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/charlie-sheen-tour-poster.jpg?w=640" alt="violent torpedo of truth tour poster" title="charlie-sheen-tour-poster"   class="size-full wp-image-4591" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/charlie-sheen-tour-poster.jpg 409w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/charlie-sheen-tour-poster.jpg?w=115 115w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/charlie-sheen-tour-poster.jpg?w=230 230w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /><p id="caption-attachment-4591" class="wp-caption-text">The poster for Charlie Sheen’s traveling one-man show.  Tickets range from $60 to $100 with some venues offering $750 passes for a meet-and-greet with the Sheenster himself. </p></div> As we all know, since we live in, like, the world, Mr. Sheen has some problems that only a mind like his can spin into “wins.”  This actor/partier once known for a string of hit movies, a cash cow CBS show, a high-profile Hollywood family and out-of-control if not abusive relationships with women is now a bizarre and erratic one-man entertainment machine.  Each day people watch, cameras crowd, everyone anticipating the next verbal morsel&mdash;what crazy thing will he say?  What morning show or late night talk show will he storm?  What could possibly top tiger blood, warlocks, two girlfriends and Sober Valley Lodge?  Hungry, starving (for what? I wonder), everyone eats it up, gorging on the man and his ranting ramblings and somehow everyone remains hungry for more.</p>
<p>But me, I don’t get the punchline.  Where everyone else may zero in on the joke of it all, the epic hilarity, the constant surprise, I see the far away look in his too-black eyes.  I see a face, weirdly gaunt, alternately stretched and crumpled into a rubbery sallow mask.  He looks sick, malnourished, itchy and sleepless.</p>
<p>He looks like my mom.</p>
<p>My undiagnosed but sick-with-schizophrenia mom.  She’s who I see when I look at Charlie and she makes it hard for me to laugh.</p>
<p>Erratic ranting with delusions of grandeur?  I’ve heard that schtick since age 8.  That set is tired.  Zany adventures?  Oh, I’ve gone for a “car ride” that suddenly turned into a 6 hour trip or kidnapping&mdash;depending on how you look at it.  Let me tell you, the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants Sheen-style mental illness rollercoaster is thrilling, but not in a good way.  It’s draining.  It’s terrifying.  It’s maddening.  It’s sad.</p>
<p>This is not to say that it absolutely can’t be funny.  I would never say that.  My sense of humor could very well be the thing that’s kept me a fairly functional human being, you know, for a grad student.</p>
<p>Laughing is channeled out of our fear and discomfort.  It breaks the tension, transforms pain into ridiculous pleasure.  What’s problematic in the Sheen situation for me is the cheapness of the joke and the utter disregard for the humanity of the figure in question.  I can’t help but feel that every “news” show that hands money over to our fool <em>du jour</em> and sits him in front of a camera is killing him a little.  Each manager that supports him, each ticket sold to his already sold-out comedy tour (oh, yeah, that’s happening) is just actualizing and strengthening the hold of the manic or psychotic delusions he so needs to cure himself of.  I feel like we’re pointing and laughing at someone who can’t help himself and that makes me feel dirty and ashamed for all of us.</p>
<p>Would we so thoroughly lambast and laugh at a cancer patient in a similar fashion?  Ha, ha!  Low white blood cell count!  Or the handicapped?  Nice “Olympics” loser!</p>
<p>I can’t help but think that our country is still pretty deeply in denial about the breadth and reach of mental illness and this is partly behind our reaction to the Sheen circus.  If we’re laughing because his sickness is scary, his empty eyes jolting, I get it.  If we’re laughing because we all harbor ridiculous pain, incredible loss, stupid inequity, and Charlie, for a few seconds a day, takes the burden of being butt of the joke off of our own aching backs, I get that, too.  But if we’re laughing more as the weeks go on and on because it’s easy, because we can’t be bothered to care about other people, because we’re too dazed and confused to empathize, sympathize just a tiny bit with a very sick man or his family, then I’m left to wonder who the joke is really on and I hope we have the courage to be better, smarter and at the very least, funnier than that.</p>
