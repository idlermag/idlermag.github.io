										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMC’s much anticipated <em>Mad Men</em> premiere came and went this past Sunday night and boy did it leave me feeling. . . funny.  This show that once revelled in style, laid on the cool and laid it on thick, has definitely gone through some changes.  Following Don Draper’s lead, where the feel was once confident, sexy, defiant, and unapologetically mysterious, it has now become heavily marked by paranoia, aggression, alienation, and tangible nervousness.  It’s not that these latter qualities haven’t always been there, I’d argue they have, it’s just that in this most recent season opener anxiety engenders the characters’ world much more completely. Fear is encroaching, and that beautiful coolness of old is hardly believable or available for our retro TV friends.  While I watched the premiere, it was joking and bad jokes that both caught my attention and best help me explain the feelings of discomfort creator Matt Weiner seems to be exploring this season.  </p>
<p>First of all, the show is framed with some pretty heady political issues made light of by The (proverbial) Man in each instance. The first image we see is that of a group of black men and women protesting for equal rights outside of Y&amp;R, a rival ad company. Upstairs in the building, a couple of idiot ad men ridicule the protesters claiming they should shut up and get jobs instead of walking around in circles. Noting the literal meteorological heat &#8212; if not the metaphorical kind &#8212; our privileged white man-children then pummel the crowd below with makeshift ice-water balloons. The joke only becomes unfunny to these fellows when the crowd comes upstairs and a woman (quite maternally) admonishes them for having hit not only fellow people, but a child, as well.  </p>
<p>Seeing this as a viewer feels strange and uncomfortable for many reasons.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> This is an ugly part of our country’s history and we’re seeing it played out again from the perspective of the privileged majority.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Mad Men</em> rarely takes up racial issues, often choosing to only glance at or gesture toward their existence. If you’re a fan of <em>Mad Men</em>, this scene further reminds you that hey, maybe such plot points should have been part of the storylines all along.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Though it’s good that we’re finally offered a more direct racial encounter on the show, it is still on the fringes of the real (read: white) story.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>  And if actual race relations and characters of color are going to miraculously become much more prevalent to the storylines, is the show going to do it clunkily/offensively or well?  Eep!</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m nervous about how this will be handled.  I already felt more than a little distressed by the good vs. evil melodrama in this episode. When the woman scolds the ad men she proudly, boldly huffs, “and they call us savages.”  I just hope that Weiner’s response this season is not a “noble savage” resolution to a white guilt problem. </p>

<p>Another political joke gone wrong? To really stick it to the bigoted guys from Y&amp;R and create a lot of buzz about the “good guys” at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, the company publishes an ad (that they can’t really afford) claiming they’re hiring a secretary, and unlike some other places, they’re an equal opportunity employer.  Take that Y&amp;R!  And there was much laughing and drinking of cocktails. . . that is until, as Roger so eloquently puts it, “the lobby is full of negroes.”  The team’s expensive little joke gets a little more expensive as now there’s pressure to not just talk the talk of their joke’s setup, but actually hire a person of color on staff.  This could be the transitional moment for both the office and the show, but it may be a token one and lodged in a joke at that.  Again, I felt a little funny about this.  Funny weird, not funny ha-ha.</p>
<p>But, the societal upheaval bits were mostly bookends; per usual, the camera was more firmly focused on the typical cast of characters and their dramas and growing pains.  Don Draper is turning the big 4-0 (alter ego Dick Whitman has been forty for half the year) and though he tries to play it off, this turn of events seems to shake him.  Don has settled down a little, is enjoying the comforts of wife (the second) and home and family.  He makes breakfast, he appears to follow up on his fatherly promises.  Ah, seems pretty nice and domestic for old Don!  Driving the kids back to their mother’s ghastly large estate he even jokes to “say hi to Morticia and Lurch.”  Funnier than this though was when he asks his sweet kiddies, “How old will I be when you’re forty?” His son quickly answers, “You’ll be dead.”  If you’ve been thinking, “This is Don’s world and we’re just living in it,” well, his son’s laconic statement about the fleeting nature of life and the revolutionary power of time might just change your mind.  </p>
<p>Megan, Don’s upgraded secretary, is young and lithe and lovely and only further makes a farce of the possible downfall of Draper. Her role in the episode is mostly to be peachy and youthful, impetuous and girlish. Throwing together a surprise party for Don at the last minute completely throws the office for a loop.  The late invitation, while just a fun whim to Megan, reads to the advertisers (you know, those makers and sellers of hidden meaning) as a harbinger of doom.  “Why was I invited so late?” “ Have I done something to be downgraded?” “ Am I getting fired?” “ Am I not fun at parties?”  Nobody knows where they fit in, if their office is good enough, if they’re even happy.  At the party itself, Megan is having a gay old time laughing the night away with a homosexual black man (oh, little miss counterculture!) while Roger gently has to assure Don that they aren’t laughing at him.  </p>

<p>Okay, here’s the bit you’ve probably heard a lot about. Megan performs a ridiculous french pop song and dance for Don at the party.  I guess it’s the French-Canadian version of the Marilyn “Happy Birthday.”  It was so cheesily bad that I kind of loved it, but again &#8212; awkward!  It was too sexy and intimate for a group of coworkers, who are basically strangers.  The twee-ness of the performance prickled against its audience and the dissonance was palpable. And the even weirder thing that follows is Don’s reaction to the ordeal.  </p>
<p>Anyone could see this was a stupid idea, this dumb surprise &#8212; Peggy claims the scenario has Lucy Ricardo written all over it &#8212; so, I wasn’t shocked that Draper was pissed and the Mrs. was pouty.  What was bizarre was the cleaning scene that takes place post-party.  Stripped down to her perfectly matching and tres sexy skivvies, Megan throws herself into tidying the living room&#8230;you know, like you do.  She starts yelling at Don to stop looking at her that he can’t have it, the looking, or her, the person, which apparently melts Don’s anger and turns him on to no end. UGH. Cue an aggressive physical struggle that boils over into passion and ends with a discussion about the once beautiful white carpet the party (and this disgusting rape fantasy) has sullied.  The white carpet is so lovely, so chic, it’s what everyone wants or thinks they want, but it’s completely impractical.  It can’t withstand life without being changed or destroyed.  Megan is disappointed and upset that a new one will be necessary.  Don, from the marketing perspective, has always been aware that you need multiple white carpets to sell the illusion of the perfect one.  There’s a lot going on here. </p>
<p>Though I was pretty disgusted by the bizarre sexual display, I think (I hope) it was there to make us feel gross.  We can read this moment as a nasty reminder of how desperate Don is behind his mask of dapper masculinity.  Truthfully, he doesn’t really know what he wants or needs &#8212; he makes his decisions based on what people tell him he should desire or what he shouldn’t dare to take.  His persona is attractive, but empty and reliant upon women and others lower than him in the hierarchy.  He has all the set pieces of a good life, but there is no concrete experience of happiness he can cling to &#8212; he’s still going to die some day.  It’s only in the practice of forcibly taking, or owning, or exerting power that he appears passionate. In a culture of comparison, he and the other characters are better at figuring out if they look happy than they are at comprehending/experiencing satisfaction.</p>
<p>Everyone, I mean everyone is makes fun of Don, but Roger assures him it’s only because he’s happy. </p>
<p>Is <em>Mad Men</em> trying to figure out what its idea of happiness really is?  Don does have the immaculate white carpet, a wife willing to sully it with a party, a nameless (black? brown?) girl to come in and clean it, and the money to replace it if he pleases.  I imagine this season will further suss out what it means to be happy for each of our regular characters and maybe a few new ones.  At this point the only difference seems to be having the power to be in on, or at least aware of, the jokes instead of being completely alienated by them.</p>

<p><em>N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk</em> is a critically acclaimed, renegade stage show about race and racism. Sporting only three actors who reflect the &#8220;characters&#8221; in the title, and using a combination of theater, stand up and slam poetry, this smart comedy has been a runaway hit throughout the US. <em>The New York Times</em> has called it “A success. Remarkably well-timed to land in the middle of the national discomfort zone,” and Tavis Smiley from NPR has said, “A very funny play, and a very important one, as well.” The live show which stars Rafael Augustin, Jackson McQueen and Dionysio Basco is fresh off its 32-state national tour, and gearing up for its anxiously anticipated Los Angeles run from April 1st to the 23rd. Today, I have the pleasure of talking with two of the charismatic men behind <em>N*W*C</em>—co-writer and co-director, Steven T. Seagle, who is also co-creator of the Cartoon Network series <em>BEN 10</em> and <em>Generator Rex</em>, and author of numerous graphic novels including <em>It’s A Bird</em>, and Rafael Augustin, director of the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival, and <em>N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk</em> co-writer and actor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The show is called </em>N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk<em>. What gave you the idea to use these slurs as the title for a play about racism and race? Is your intention to deemphasize these words and take away some of their power? </em></p>

<p><strong>RA:</strong> We feel there’s a difference between calling people these words and having a dialogue about them. Any adult that is offended by our title must first consider what these three words did to the three you kids who were called these words, grappled with their sense of cultural identity because of it, and then grew up to co-create <em>N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> The big push in the past few years has been to tell people to just stop saying the N-Word in particular—</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> Yeah, no one seems to care too much about eliminating the other two!</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> The push to suddenly pretend like a word doesn’t exist doesn’t solve a problem, it just brings new ones. As a solution, it’s like not looking at a wound—you don’t see it, but it’s still there—and unattended to—getting worse instead of better. <em>N*W*C</em> starts a dialogue in communities where we perform, and the show advances that dialogue. It puts a human face on those dehumanizing terms. We think that’s a more effective means of grappling with those words.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>From the title, I think people may be surprised by what a friendly, disarming show N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk is. The play is laugh-out-loud hilarious, but some parts are also very poignant and heartfelt. Was it a challenge to create a piece that balances engaging comedy with social commentary?</em></p>

<p><strong>SS:</strong> Our company, Speak Theater Arts, grew out of a tradition of finding the comedy in the real life struggles and stories of our artists. So we crafted the writing in <em>N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk</em> in such a way that after landing really big laughs we pull the rug out from under the audience and drop in an unexpected serious moment—and then pull that rug out just as fast and land a joke right in the middle of a serious moment too. It creates a really unusual kind of nervous laughter that we’d not really seen in other comedies. The challenge is striking that balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>N*W*C <em>does a good job of exploring race issues by funneling them into the unique experiences of the characters in the piece, as well as presenting that alongside broader, more universal themes of race. How close are the anecdotes in the performance to the actors’ actual experiences?</em></p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> All of the stories depicted in the show are real. And we’re not talking Hollywood’s “Based on a true story” and then you find out the only thing that’s real are the people’s names! Everything in the show actually happened to us: the Huckleberry Finn story, the beach immigration raid. . . the gay club.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> We’ve obviously edited and sweetened the stories in staging them for comedy, but they’re all based on actual events that occurred.</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> But as to the question everyone has after watching the show’s running joke of the “Big Penis” contest—we can’t confirm or deny who the actual “winner” is because it would ruin the illusion of theater!</p>
<p><em>Rafael, I know that</em> N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk <em>began as your brainchild, and an idea that you had in response to the lack of performance material available to people of color. Can you tell us a little more about how this play was born?</em></p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> The play was born out of my necessity to write myself into existence in the Los Angeles theater world. Unless you play a prisoner (which I did!), there aren’t that many opportunities for people of color in the industry. So I turned to Steve and our other co-writer/co-director, Liesel Reinhart, in a desire to create a show where I could play a fully realized individual. But during the writing process we realized that no show that we could invent would be more significant than our personal stories. I credit Steve and Liesel for that realization.</p>
<p><em>You are both partners along with Liesel Reinhart in leading Speak Theater Arts, the company that houses</em> N*W*C <em>as well as the cultural comedy,</em> Armeniamania!<em>. Part of the goal of Speak Theater Arts is to reach out to new audiences who feel that today&#8217;s theater does not speak to them. Can you tell us more about the company?</em></p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> The company actually formed around the unexpected success of the show. We went from being a student show at the University of California Los Angeles, to a professional run in downtown LA, to being signed for our first national tour in about three months total time. So we had to form Speak Theatre Arts to support that and subsequent local runs and national tours.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> As soon as we were an entity, people who loved <em>N*W*C</em> started asking, “What’s next?” And so we reached into the world that <em>N*W*C</em> incubated in—the American Readers Theater Association—and started developing other works with a similar DNA. We’ve staged <em>Armeniamania!</em> locally and hope to bring that work—a comedy about being second generation kids with first generation immigrant parents—back soon. Our star, Sona Movsesian became Conan O’Brien’s assistant and her schedule is nuts! But hopefully this year will see that show come back.</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> We also produced and directed one of the national premiere staged readings of Moises Kaufman’s <em>Laramie Project: Ten Years Later</em>.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> Which was a huge undertaking for a little company! We had sixty members of the Gay Men’s Chorus Los Angeles, Randi Driscoll’s live band, and a cast of celebrity readers including people like Mary McDonnell, Mary McCormack, Bradley Whitford, Sharon Lawrence, and many other great actors.</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> We were honored to be part of that important day, but our focus going forward is creating original works.</p>
<p><em>Steven, your background is in screen, animation and comic book writing, and in 2000 you helped form the Development / Production Company <a href="http://www.manofaction.tv/" target="new">Man of Action Studios</a> (the studio behind</em> Ben-10 <em>and</em> Generator Rex<em>). How did you come into the Speak Theater Arts company as a partner and the live</em> N*W*C <em>stage show as co-writer and co-director?</em></p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> Speak Theater Arts was a project I tried to get off the ground long before Man of Action came into being. I wanted to find a way to take the fringe stylings of the contemporary readers theater movement in America—which had moved far from people in suits sitting on stools reading from notebooks—and stage it for performing arts venues. My early efforts were limited. But once we pulled <em>N*W*C</em> together and saw how viable it was a piece of legitimate theater, I realized that this was what I’d been trying to create six or seven years earlier and gave over the name and the resources for Speak Theater Arts.</p>
<p><em>Apart from being entertained, what do you hope audiences take away from</em> N*W*C <em>after watching it?</em></p>

I love that people come to watch this play and laugh for 95 minutes and are constantly engaged. We wrote it for the short attention span generations. But luckily, because every member of Speak Theater Arts has an educational background, our comedy comes with a point. <em>N*W*C</em> tackles the concept of “race.” There is no white race or Latino race. . . there is only the human race. So if we are all human (African to be exact), then how do we explain all the racism and social inequality that exists today? We do that through comedy, but the point is not lost on our audiences.</p>
<p>N*gger Wetb*ck Ch*nk <em>has caught the attention of the</em> New York Times<em>, the</em> Los Angeles Times<em>, NPR, CBS Radio and countless other outlets. What’s next for the show? Any plans to release a live DVD?</em></p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> We did a five-camera, full TV shoot for DVD, but we want people to come see it live in theaters, so we’ve resisted releasing that shoot.</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> Plus, theater never comes across the same on film. And this is definitely a live event. We love that shared laughter creates communities.</p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> We are currently developing a sitcom based around the experiences <em>N*W*C</em> had touring America and running into some interesting kinds of race relations. Our producers are happy and we’ll go out to out to networks with the pitch in the next month or so.</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> Touring America with this show has been such a trip (no pun intended). We’ve done a lot of national radio: left-leaning radio shows pussyfoot around the title, and have us say it, and right-leaning radio shows can’t stop saying the words! We’ve also managed to piss off Neo-Nazis and the NAACP alike along the way—but people who take offense are also people who have not seen the show. They react to the title without gathering any more information on who we are and what we do.</p>
<p><em>Speak Theater Arts is also active in educational and community outreach, and in youth art programs. I’m curious what you both think about NewSouth Books’ recent choice to replace all the instances of &#8220;Nigger Jim&#8221; to &#8220;Slave Jim&#8221; in their new edition of Mark Twain’s</em> Huckleberry Finn<em>. Do you think hiding these words and prejudices from children today is helping or hurting them?</em></p>
<p><strong>SS:</strong> Well, this is exactly why our show is still touring and still drawing big audiences. We still live in a world where people think that the best way to handle a derogatory term is to whitewash it—to camouflage the racism that is part of our history. Pretending something didn’t happen doesn’t make it go away. Kids may not read the word in that book, but they’ll hear it somewhere and the context won’t have been in one of America’s most important novels.</p>
<p><strong>RA:</strong> I personally hate it! Mostly on the grounds that I refuse to call our show <em>Sl*ve Wetb*ck Ch*nk</em>!</p>
