										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The range of my taste in film covers a wide area. </p>
<p>If my tastes were represented by a country&#8217;s land area, it would be Russia. Despite my fiancée&#8217;s insistence that I don&#8217;t like any film made after 2000 &#8212; mainly because I had not watched <em>Superbad</em> until last week &#8212; I enjoy many different films. My film collection would suggest as much, which ranges from Oscar winning classics of the 1960s to b-movies of the 1980s, and many more. </p>
<p>One film that holds a place of honor on my shelf is the Bruce Willis vehicle, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/" target="_blank">Hudson Hawk</a></em> (1991). It is absurd, ridiculous, and preposterous. </p>
<p>And I love every damn frame. I love the film so much, I even referenced it in <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/13/microsoft-outlook/" target="_blank">one of my comic strips</a>. </p>
<p>I have a soft-spot for absurd action-comedies, and Hudson Hawk is more or less my gold standard. It is also on the short list of films I have purchased in two or more formats: first VHS, and then DVD (<em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, and <em>Army of Darkness</em> being the others. <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> will join that list eventually. <em>Gremlins</em>, however, is the reigning champ: VHS, DVD, and Laserdisc—in that order).</p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> is a love it or hate it film. </p>
<p>Folks I know who love the film, love it to pieces and quote it often (the film is incredibly quotable: “You took down Captain Bob&#8217;s steering wheel?!”, “Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!”, “Hey Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.”). </p>
<p>But, for those who can&#8217;t embrace the absurdity, <em>Hudson Hawk</em> is the worst thing put to celluloid this side of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero" target="_blank">Last Action Hero</a></em> (the subject of a future article). </p>
<p>Is <em>Hudson Hawk</em> a perfect film? Hardly.</p>
<p>But, it is entertaining and hilarious (keep in mind this comes from a guy who draws comics rife with <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/06/schmoopy/" target="_blank">absurd humor</a>). It is full of gags I love to death. The scene where the Pope is watching Mr. Ed dubbed into Italian gets me every time. Another favorite (and speaking as someone who is half-Italian) is when an Italian guard pours spaghetti, with sauce, out of a Thermos.</p>
<p>Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello, to me, form an impressive comedic duo. I love their snappy dialogue and banter. They have chemistry, and they come across as real pals. If you go into <em>Hudson Hawk</em> expecting a <em>Die Hard</em>, you will be incredibly disappointed (although the same could probably be said of <em>Die Hard 2</em>). Yet, if you approach <em>Hudson Hawk</em> as a poor man&#8217;s <em>Ghostbusters</em> or <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>, it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>Maybe. I don&#8217;t make any promises.</p>
<p>If you can find the DVD, give the director commentary by Michael Lehmann a listen. It is as entertaining as it is informative, and I love Lehmann&#8217;s refrain of “Did I mention this film did well in Europe?” after some of the gags. He also explains several scenes which were cut from the film, including a sub-plot about Willis getting revenge for the death of his monkey sidekick, Little Eddie (YES). </p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> isn&#8217;t perfect, and it isn&#8217;t for everyone, but for those, like myself, who enjoy absurdity, it is 100 minutes well spent. </p>
<p>And it is way funnier than <em>Die Hard 2</em>.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
