										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear readers, remember that time I said that counting calories was bullshit? Well, I still think that’s true. But now I’m just a hypocrite.</p>
<p>A few months ago, after six months of rock climbing and a long walk in bad shoes, I sprained my big toe. Despite being one of the lamest possible injuries, it meant that even walking was a challenge. I normally work out five or six days a week, but I really didn’t want to injure myself any worse.  I switched to a stationary bike, did push-ups as if I enjoyed doing push-ups, and tried to stop myself from complaining. I was not very successful. I thought if I just took it a little easy, my toe would go ahead and heal itself. But after three weeks, I was sort of able to walk but hadn’t gotten much better. So I went to the doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor told me I needed to quit doing everything for two weeks. Apparently my toe was too weak for even the friggin’ stationary bike. I realize it’s irritating for an able-bodied human like myself to complain about not being able to exercise. Feel free to skip ahead to the next paragraph where I get less irritating. But I depend on exercise to keep me from being a puddle of anxiety. I also have a hard time taking breaks from exercising, which I know has so much psychological subtext that I’m not even going to go there. Instead I came up with new habits like dusting the top ledge of the baseboard and cleaning the tiny ridges in the kitchen mat. But I was a good girl and listened to the doctor.</p>
<p>After exactly two weeks had passed and after more than a month of only half-assedly working out, I wanted to do something to jump-start being healthy again. I don’t own a scale so I only knew how much I weighed from going to the doctor’s office. And while I hadn’t necessarily gained weight, I had lost muscle tone and didn’t feel like my normal self. I felt lethargic and sad. I didn’t want to diet because fuck diets, but I had a new set of workout videos (<em>TurboFire</em>, of infomercial bleached-blonde fame). And the workouts came with a (wait for it) “5-Day Inferno Plan.” Apparently this eating plan would involve going to hell. Despite my hatred of diets and my worry of becoming too obsessive about counting calories, I decided to go ahead with the INFERNO.</p>
<p>The plan involved eating five effing times a day: a small breakfast, a snack, a small lunch, another snack, and a HUGE dinner with some sort of meat, vegetable, and grain. But it appealed to me because it was still actual meals with actual food (and allowed both cheese and coffee). It took me several trips to get everything because the food plan is VERY SPECIFIC about portions and measurements (which I actually enjoyed because it appeals to my control-freak side), and I didn’t want to mess with the calories. It also cost me nearly $130. (And I didn’t even buy their ridiculously expensive branded protein shake, but instead pilfered some of Charlie’s protein powder.) But by then I was literally too invested, so ONWARD.</p>
<p>Each of the days was paired with either a 50-minute cardio video or a 45 minute cardio + 15 minutes interval training video. The point was that all that work means you should probably be eating more, and mostly protein and vegetables with some brown grains. But even with five meals a day, it only averaged out to 1,200-ish calories a day. Charlie thought it was way too little, but I figured I was a tiny little woman and it would be fine.</p>
<p>I started off optimistic as hell. Here are some of the things I ate in the first few days:</p>

<p>I even got to eat bacon twice. Turkey bacon, but still. I discovered that cottage cheese with fruit isn’t terrible. Some of the recipes were actually delicious—like the egg salad pita, tuna salad, and the turkey avocado wrap. The others, not so much. The first three bites of the baked potato seemed good, considering it had cheese, sour cream, and bacon on it. But it turns out that one tablespoon of sour cream and one sad lonely slice of bacon just is NOT the right ratio for a baked potato. I ended up mostly choking down plain potato and feeling sorry for myself.</p>

<p>I was hungry all the damn time. 1,200 calories is not a lot of food. Do you know how little four ounces of meat is? I asked the man working at the deli counter for two four-ounce pieces of salmon and he <em>laughed</em> at me. Look at this dinner plate:</p>

<p>Not only did I have to scarf down bok choy (which tastes like the insole of a sweaty shoe), but look at the proportion of actual delicious salmon to vegetable and brown rice. I COULD BE EATING A BURRITO WHAT AM I EVEN DOING.</p>
<p>Even though I love having recipes tell me what to do, I got tired of constantly measuring out every little thing. I became obsessed with googling things like “How big is 6 oz of flank steak?” and “How many teaspoons is 3 oz of shredded cheese?” and other such EXCITING things. I didn’t have a food scale so most of the time I was just winging it and feeling like a failure. But then I started vowing that I&#8217;d do better. I started researching food scale prices. I would measure the 1/4 avocado exactly because those precise measurements would make me look and feel good. I’d gotten sucked in, become a slave to the ounces and to counting how many almonds I was eating.</p>
<p>On the third planned day, one of my friends wanted to go out. She was moving away, and it was one of the last days we both had free. I texted her that I was on a VERY IMPORTANT EATING PLAN and might not be able to go out. Was she free on Tuesday, once I was done? No, she wasn’t. I spent hours agonizing over what choice would make me a more terrible person.  My friend was moving many states away, and I had no idea when I’d see her again, versus messing up the plan and maybe having some of the $130 food go to waste. I didn&#8217;t want to give up on the plan because what did that say about me? That I couldn&#8217;t even commit five days to something? I didn&#8217;t want to give up on my friend, because choosing an eating plan over a friend is insane, right?</p>
<p>Eventually I decided that I didn’t want to be the biggest asshole on the planet and that I loved my friend. So I decided to screw the plan for a day and instead eat tapas and drink mimosas and sangria and I didn’t regret a single fucking minute.</p>
<p>After the day off, I finished the rest of the eating plan as closely as I was able. I have no idea (nor do I much care) if I lost any weight. The pictures I took of myself do show a little difference, and I learned how to snack like a grownup. I also learned that some vegetables (cucumbers, red peppers, zucchini) are actually good to snack on, and that almond butter on sliced apples is far superior to peanut butter. I felt like a healthy, active person again.</p>
<p>But I also learned that eating one waffle for breakfast is really depressing. I learned how easy it would be to start slowly shaving calories off my allotted amount. I learned that people don’t like hearing about eating plans, and how easy it would be to lie about what I’m eating. And I learned how quickly those grams of fat and 1/3 tablespoons make you feel like a good and put-together person.</p>
<p>I’d rather not be that sort of person. Instead I’ll maybe try to eat more vegetables and pay closer attention to portion sizes. I will continue to work out and teach myself to take more breaks. I&#8217;ll still be proud of myself when I eat well and work out harder. But I want to continue to be the person who would choose sangria with a friend over a bowl of vegetables by myself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me be clear that the title of this article is meant to be an exaggeration &#8212; by car, I live a very comfortable two or three minutes from a well-stocked grocery store with plenty of produce and a somewhat self-involved organic food section. (I&#8217;m down with organic foods, but this place is set up kind of weird, with all the organic stuff by itself between the paper towels and the frozen foods. If you&#8217;re looking for something organic, it won&#8217;t be by the regular item, it&#8217;ll be off by itself in the organic section. Me, I tend to just avoid it.)</p>
<p>No, my own private food desert is my apartment.</p>
<p>Like many people in this fine country of ours, I&#8217;m a bit heavier than I ought to be. And, again, without overstating the problem, things of late had been getting worse than better, so there are fewer impulse foods around the house. There is a strategically limited supply of dark chocolate, and cream cheese is strictly rationed. Red meat, already scarce, is gone almost entirely. There&#8217;s a solid supply of chicken breasts and ground turkey, but potato and corn chips are <em>persona non grata</em>.</p>
<p>None of these trends are entirely new to the Craig kitchen, but they have definitely become more pronounced.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing, although not, apparently, good enough. Because, you see, while my waistline has stopped expanding, after a good start, it&#8217;s stopped shrinking as well.</p>
<p>Before I lose you entirely, let me reaffirm that under no circumstances will this become a diet column. I have no interest in trading tips, debating the perfect diet, or passing any judgment on individual foods other than whether or not it makes me happy to put them in my mouth. (I do have such opinions, but like politics and religion, it is often best to keep such things to one&#8217;s self.) In the long run, my goal is to stay the same weight, and one not terribly far from the one I am now.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>
<p>So what do I do? Well, largely, I&#8217;m going to put a bit more time in at the gym, and I&#8217;m going to work to reconcile myself to being just a little hungry all the time until I get there. And that&#8217;s the complaint of which I&#8217;m most ashamed. Too many people deal with real hunger, and I, emphatically, do not equate my position with theirs. I am, however, finding that I do not deal well with that constant gnawing urge, and I&#8217;m looking forward to being done with it.</p>
<p>But there are two cheap tricks that I&#8217;m going to try in order to (hopefully) give me that additional push.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m going to cut liquid calories to an absolute bare minimum. For someone who doesn&#8217;t drink water, well, almost ever, I actually do better than you might expect on this front. Most of what I drink on a day-to-day basis is aspartame sweetened powdered tea or lemonade. (Yeah, it&#8217;s Crystal Light. And yeah, it&#8217;s pink lemonade. What?) However, that Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA has 209 calories per 12 ounces. (The 90 Minute IPA has 294.) And my beer snobbery means that light beers are out of the question, so yeah, beer is kind of out until I reach my goal.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not motivation, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p>And second, carrots. They&#8217;re low in calories, and even better, they&#8217;re incredibly satisfying to chew. And for me, at least, when I&#8217;m hungry, that&#8217;s a huge help. Chewing carrots (or sugar-free gum) at the end of the meal has been a great trick to let my stomach catch up with my mouth. It gives my chompers something to do, and it takes my mind off food.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p>But the sooner I get there, the sooner I get to have interesting food in my house again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I’ve been traveling nonstop for the last two weeks (from Boston to Springfield back to Boston, to Washington D.C., to Baltimore, to Roseville, Michigan, to Brighton, to Detroit, and back to Boston), I haven’t done any cooking at all. (I did, however, spend a weekend with my aunts and baked <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/17/killer-yeast/">the cinnamon rolls</a> again, this time with brown sugar, no nuts, and the help of my nine-year-old cousin. I left the rolled-up dough in the fridge overnight and baked the rolls in the morning. They were, if anything, better than the last time.) Travel brings up all sorts of food issues&mdash;healthy eating, fast food, social eating, social drinking&mdash;so I’ll be doing a miniseries of non-cooking blogs. This week, I’ll write about which fat-free foods I’m afraid of and which I think aren’t bullshit and are worth eating. </p>
<p>I don’t believe in diets.  I think the obsession with being skinny and/or fear of being fat drives people to do some insane things. Sure, maybe cutting all carbohydrates out of your diet might make you lose weight, but that is not a sustainable way to live. <em>Diet</em> even has the word <em>die</em> in it. People who diet want to lose weight, but I think the losing can become so all-consuming that long-term health goes out the window. (Before I say the things I’m about to say, keep in mind that I am not a trained doctor or nutritionist. I am, however, someone with common sense. What I say might not be helpful for you, but it’s been helpful for me.) Here is a fact: we need food to live. We need <em>fat</em> to live. We need carbohydrates for energy. We need fruits and vegetables. Here is another fact: dieting is not fun. Have you ever seen someone on a diet? Have you ever talked to anyone on a diet? It’s all they can talk about. It’s all they can think about. It’s really boring to listen to. And usually, they are talking about some way that they failed.</p>
<p>Is that really good for you? Maybe you cut out some fat, but maybe then you really wanted that ice cream and now you are stressed and anxious and feeling bad about yourself because you’ve failed. Here is another fact: Stress and anxiety are bad for your body, too.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that because pizza and ice cream are delicious, you should eat some every night (although that does sound really tasty right now).  But, what’s the happy medium? No matter how you look at it, even if you hate diets like I do, eating too many calories will be a problem. In this post, I’ll tell you about some of the ways I try to eat a little healthier without wanting to drown my sorrows in chocolate chips.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading Michael Pollan’s small handbook, <em>Food Rules: An Eater’s Manual</em>. His motto for eating is “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” I’m still working on the plants part, but I think the emphasis in that statement is <em>food</em>. Eat real food. Seriously. In the book, he says that we should shop only around the perimeter of the grocery store—bread, dairy, meat, and produce. All of that is food your body needs. The rest is food <em>products</em>, stuff with varying levels of actual food and chemicals you’ve never heard of.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying I’m some kind of food martyr like vegans are or that I only eat raw. However, I really high-five the impulse to try and eat mostly things that are actually on the food pyramid. This means that I eat only real sugar and NEVER Splenda, or Sweet ‘n’ Low, or whatever other new sweetener that pretends to be natural but isn’t. (Made <em>with</em> sugar? That always makes me wonder what else it’s made with. Powdered unicorn horn?) Did you know a teaspoon of sugar only has 15 calories? I don’t add much more than a teaspoon of sugar to anything unless I’m baking. Also, guess what? Sugar is made from a plant. Let’s relax and not be so afraid of sugar. (Unless you’re diabetic. In which case, you should probably be a little afraid.)</p>
<p>Next on my list is butter. I eat real butter for the same reason I use real sugar. It’s made from actual dairy. I buy a butter that is made with yogurt, so it has fewer calories than regular butter, but is still made from ingredients I recognize. I’d rather use the real thing and just use less of it. My (super arbitrary) rule is only one dip with the knife into the tub of butter. I’ll leave the muscle of that one dip up to you.</p>
<p>Part of my decision to eat real food includes avoiding diet soda. If I want soda that badly, I’ll have a real soda. Diet soda frightens me. Have you ever seen what Diet Coke does to people? I’ve known several people who drink can after can, all day long. What is <em>in</em> that shit that makes people so addicted to it? It can’t be the flavor. To anyone who says that you can’t taste a difference between diet and regular, you are straight up lying (or there is something wrong with your taste buds). Maybe that nasty aftertaste kills some of your sensory nerves. Bottom line, to me, the diet doesn’t satisfy. If you’re going to indulge, why not on something that actually tastes good? If I’m going to eat a chocolate bar or an ice cream sundae, I don’t want the dairy-free, sugar-free, fat-free crap. I want all the calories. And it will be amazing.</p>
<p>Now, on to some lower-fat options that have been worth my while. </p>
<ol>
<li>Reduced fat peanut butter. Here, I honestly don’t notice a taste difference. There is no fake sweetener in the reduced-fat version, so why not?</li>
<li>Reduced fat Ritz crackers. I don’t know what they do to these, and I sense it’s probably nothing good, but they taste no different to me.</li>
<li>Low-fat plain yogurt. This is just made with skim milk. Since I’m dependent on dairy to keep me from going into a hypoglycemic rage most of the time, I like to find low-fat options that taste good. I add a teaspoon of honey or sugar to it, and sometimes a drop or two of vanilla extract—check the sugar on some flavored yogurts sometime. It’s like candy.</li>
<li>Skim milk. I know. Some people think it’s watery, and I might agree, but I’ve gotten used to it. I graded down from 1% to ½%, and now to skim. If you think it’s too gross, I recommend organic skim milk, if you can afford it. It’s skim and somehow still really creamy. It’s magic.</li>
</ol>
<p>The items above are things I eat often, so it was worth it for me to switch out to lower-fat options. Again, remember that I’m not an expert whatsoever. However, I do think that it’s worth it to eat food that tastes good in moderation, instead of torturing yourself with half-assed substitutes. Do you have any that you recommend? Are you vegan and want to fight me? Leave a comment!</p>
