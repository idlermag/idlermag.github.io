<p><strong><em>ANTON CHIGURH</em></strong> is no man.  He is a force of nature, a symbol.  Those who complained about a lack of resolution in the Coen brother’s 2007 best picture winner <em>No Country for Old Men</em> were missing something.  For Chigurh to have been killed or end up in prison would have been too pedestrian and, as an indestructible symbol of “all that dark and all that cold,” an impossibility.</p>
<p>Take, for example, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4RnHsV3wIo" target="new">this scene in which Anton Chigurh locates Lewellyn Moss via a beacon planted in a bag of stolen money</a></p>
<p>It’s brilliantly executed. Chigurh is never seen but his presence is always felt (occasionally as a shotgun blast to a window!)  It further reinforces the sense that he is something more than human.</p>
<p>A rival hitman—expertly played by Woody Harrelson—tries to impress upon the film’s protagonist exactly who he’s dealing with:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“You don&#8217;t understand. You can&#8217;t make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he&#8217;d still kill you. He&#8217;s a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>These “principles” reflect the sort of existential indifference that permeates the film.  No one is safe.  Anton Chigurh is the embodiment of that theme, and his decision to end your life may come down to a simple toss of the coin.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-H1Buew8Qg" target="new">Call it.</a></p>

<p><em><strong>THE JOKER</strong></em> made his first appearance in 1940 and has arguably become the most recognizable villain in the Batman’s sizeable pantheon.  But it wasn’t until Alan Moore put his spin on the character in DC Comic’s <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em> in 1988 that the Joker finally reached his true potential.  Moore was the first writer to delve into the very nature of Batman and the Joker’s epic rivalry and its almost inevitable outcome.  It was also listed among the chief sources of inspiration for Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the character in 2008’s <em>The Dark Knight</em>.</p>
<p>Batman, at his best, is a character that exists on the fringe of insanity.  He is, after all, a man dressed as a bat.  The idea that Batman’s latent madness only attracts more of the same has never been more fully realized than in the Joker, who seeks only to strip the Bat of all he knows and loves and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohU16OiduUs" target="new">reveal that we are all just a step away from madness</a>.</p>
<p>So the Joker reminds Batman exactly how close he is to madness, but he also reminds him why he does what he does.  The two need each other.  They are what happens when “an unstoppable force meets an immovable object”, and they are “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dtFIjaD5hA" target="new">destined to do this forever</a>,&#8221; if we’re lucky.</p>

<p><strong><em>DANIEL PLAINVIEW</em></strong> of director Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2007 oil epic <em>There Will Be Blood</em> may not be a villain in the conventional sense, but that’s exactly what makes him so extraordinary.  True villainy is often committed with great certitude, and Daniel’s last name says it all.  There are no pretenses with Daniel.  His only desire is to get enough money so that he can “get away.”  Here is a man so filled with contempt for humanity that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Evz-Nuec_U" target="new">nearly every word that passes his lips oozes with venom</a>.</p>
<p>The center of the film is the rivalry between Daniel and a young preacher named Eli (seen in the above clip), whom Daniel views as the only real opposition in his attempt to control the town.  Theirs is a game of constant one-upmanship, culminating in the the pure madness of their final confrontation.</p>
<p>Daniel Day Lewis has created a genuine monster in Daniel Plainview, but there is an element of tragedy in his brief moments of humanity.  Take Daniel’s son, who eventually enters the family oil business.  Daniel cannot stand the thought that his son is going to move away and make something of himself on his own.  His reaction to the news is vile to be sure, but the reason behind it is heartbreaking.  Even great villains can be human.</p>

<p><em><strong>DETECTIVE ALONZO HARRIS</strong></em> of 2001’s <em>Training Day</em> is charismatic, funny and intelligent.  You get the feeling that there was a time when he was considered the baddest (Michael Jackson Bad) detective in the city.  Now he’s most certainly the baddest (like, actual bad) detective in the city, shirking his real duties for some gambling action, struttin’ and straight up thuggery.  Alonzo has become nothing more than a bully and it is Jake Hoyt’s (Ethan Hawke) bad luck that he happens to be assigned to ride along with him for his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGJ7Ct6LHs8" target="new">first day of training</a>.</p>
<p>Alonzo grins, jokes and intimidates his way through Hoyt’s first day, all the while executing a plan that doesn’t come into full view for us (and Hoyt) until nearly halfway through the movie.</p>
<p>There is also the scene where Alonzo meets with several other detectives.  They share some stories and some laughs, indicating that they were probably friends at one time.  But as the conversation moves along we realize that Alonzo has forsaken all friendships by now.  He is truly alone in the mess he’s created, and we all know how animals react when backed into a corner.</p>
<p><em>Training Day</em> relies almost completely on Denzel Washington’s larger-than-life performance, and it pays off.  If you don’t believe me, check out Washington in the scene below.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih9C2Pn0zwQ" target="new">Alonzo’s transition from cocky thug to frightened street punk</a> is about as perfect as you could ask for.</p>

<p>The 2001 british gangster film <em>Sexy Beast</em> is certainly well-written and well directed, but its real claim to fame is Ben Kingsley’s performance as <em><strong>DON LOGAN</strong></em>.  His introduction is pitch-perfect.  He marches through an airport like a scud missile aimed squarely at former ganster Gary “Gal” Dove’s new found happiness.</p>
<p>“Gal” has retired to Spain from a less-than-savory career in England’s seedy underworld.  He has been accompanied by a couple of friends and his wife, with whom he is still madly in love.  Things couldn’t be better until they receive news that Don Logan is coming for a visit.  Don has a job offer for “Gal” and he simply will not take no for an answer.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<em>Chappelle's Show</em> is a strange hybrid. The cinematic clips uproot it from the live experience, but the recorded audience pulls it back down again. The big laughs are all things that a 2004 audience found funny or shocking. And some of them just aren't that funny or shocking any more.

On top of this, so many of Chappelle's sketches have become comedy classics that it's hard to genuinely find them surprising anymore. "I'm Rick James, bitch!" was hilarious. Then your mom's skeezy brother said it ten times at one holiday party a year after the show aired, and it didn't feel so funny anymore.

<em>Chappelle's Show</em> also gets bound up with what we know about Dave Chappelle's history afterward. Dave famously quit the show because he felt that he was creatively tapped and was increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that jokes he'd intended as racial satire were getting laughed at for their silly, minstrelsy qualities. He even felt that his co-creators were complicit in this—he no longer felt comfortable working with them, so after recording several sketches for a much-anticipated third season, he briefly disappeared. There were rumors about his mental health and the possibility of drug abuse. Nobody could seem to grasp that somebody so successful didn't like what he was doing anymore.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally figured out what had been bothering me about rewatching <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> on Netflix.</p>
<p>It was the laughter.</p>

Dave and his partners would write and perform prerecorded sketches, then Dave would show them to a live audience. A few shows, like <em>Saturday Night Live</em> or <em>The Daily Show</em>, do this for a handful of sketches. On <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em>, that was the entire show.</p>
<p>When it worked, it was fantastic. Sketches on <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> were downright cartoonish—Dave could get punched so hard that he&#8217;d flip end over end like Daffy Duck, or crap so hard that he would launch off the toilet bowl like a rocket ship. (An understated allusion to a legendary lost Marvin the Martian short.) They were surprising and cinematic, and the live audience would register that. And when Dave&#8217;s sense of humor was shocking or childish or startlingly truthful, the audience would register that, too.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that recording a live audience freezes a show in time. If you&#8217;re watching a movie, let&#8217;s say an older but still-contemporary-feeling comedy, like Woody Allen&#8217;s <em>Annie Hall</em>, you can laugh at whatever you like; the clichés that might have killed in 1977 just wash over you. The same is true of animated shows like <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Futurama</em>, or <em>King of the Hill</em>.</p>
<p>The live audience is really an artifact of the live, three-camera sitcom—think <em>I Love Lucy</em>, <em>The Cosby Show</em>, or <em>Seinfeld</em>. When sitcoms went single-camera and were edited together like movies—think <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>, <em>The Bernie Mac Show</em>, <em>Arrested Development</em>, <em>The Office</em>, or <em>30 Rock</em>— they gave up on the live audience AND the laugh track.</p>
<p>So <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> is a strange hybrid. The cinematic clips uproot it from that live experience, but the recorded audience pulls it back down again. The big laughs are all things that a 2004 audience found funny or shocking. And some of them just aren&#8217;t that funny or shocking six years after the fact.</p>
<p>On top of this, so many of Chappelle&#8217;s sketches have become comedy classics that it&#8217;s hard to genuinely find them surprising. &#8220;I&#8217;m Rick James, bitch!&#8221; was hilarious. Then your mom&#8217;s skeezy brother said it ten times at one holiday party a year after the show aired, and it didn&#8217;t feel so funny.</p>
<p><em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> also gets bound up with what we know about Dave Chappelle&#8217;s history afterward. Dave famously quit the show because he felt that he was creatively tapped and was increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that jokes he&#8217;d intended as racial satire were getting laughed at for their silly, minstrelsy qualities. He even felt that his co-creators were complicit in this—he no longer felt comfortable working with them, so after recording several sketches for a much-anticipated third season, he briefly disappeared. There were rumors about his mental health and the possibility of drug abuse. Nobody could seem to grasp that somebody so successful didn&#8217;t like what he was doing anymore.</p>
<p>They should have seen the signs. An unusual number of sketches—even some whole episodes—are devoted to Dave&#8217;s fantasy of quitting his successful show. In one long riff, Dave finds out he&#8217;s impregnated Oprah Winfrey, so he spectacularly quits his show, punching out Comedy Central staffers and pulling down cubicles. Of course, it turns out Dave isn&#8217;t really the father, so he&#8217;s stuck without a job OR Oprah&#8217;s money.</p>

This episode along with the Charlie Murphy/Rick James episode were probably the most famous from the second season, so I feel pretty comfortable spoiling its conceit for you. Wayne Brady, despite his smiling, singing exterior, turns out to be a gun-toting, drug-dealing pimp and murderer.</p>
<p>I watched the episode for about twenty minutes before I remembered that it was a parody of the Denzel Washington movie <em>Training Day</em>. Do you remember Denzel in <em>Training Day</em>? I kinda do&#8230; but I know I remember Wayne Brady spoofing Denzel&#8217;s performance more. And even Wayne Brady isn&#8217;t the same guy he used to be. Between <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> and appearances on <em>30 Rock</em>, <em>Girlfriends</em>, and elsewhere, he&#8217;s more than just the singing guy from <em>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</em> But he&#8217;s also hosting <em>Let&#8217;s Make A Deal</em>. It&#8217;s weird.</p>
<p>The things I found the funniest were jokes that nobody laughed at—little inside references that you have to pick up by watching the show several episodes in a clip, or strange, timeless jokes. For instance, in the Rick James episode, Charlie Murphy relates how he and his brother beat Rick after he&#8217;d dragged mud-stained boots over Eddie&#8217;s couch. Charlie remembers Eddie saying, &#8220;Wow, Rick really needs help&#8230;&#8221; Only for Charlie to come back, &#8220;Yo, we just GAVE him some help!&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing topical about it; it&#8217;s a joke that I&#8217;m sure was funny when Charlie told it in 1984, and it&#8217;s funny today.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that Comedy Central drove Chappelle&#8217;s formula into the ground, first with blatantly offensive ethnic comedians with infinitely less talent (I&#8217;m looking at you, Carlos Mencia) and then with the sometimes-funny, frequently-embarassing &#8220;Lost Episodes&#8221; from what would have been <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> Season 3. If the live-presentation formula is cumbersome with Dave presenting sketches, it&#8217;s positively uncomfortable when Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings try to stand in Dave&#8217;s place. They make awkward jokes, usually at Dave&#8217;s expense, give an excessively literal and thoroughly clumsy summary of the sketch we&#8217;re about to see, then throw it up on the screen.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t good moments in these third-season sketches. My favorite is, in a weird way, a kind of self-commentary on the postmortem nature of the show—<a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=71416&amp;title=tupac-is-still-alive" target="new">an extended joke about Tupac Shakur&#8217;s posthumous records</a>.</p>
<p>Dave is in the club, dancing with a crowd, listening to one of these unreleased Tupac recordings, when Tupac starts making references to events after his death, like George W. Bush&#8217;s election, then covering it over with lines like &#8220;when I say George W, I mean a George W. Smith, for city council here in Oakland&#8230; you probably didn&#8217;t hear about it.&#8221; The chorus for the song turns out to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wrote this song a long time ago<br />
A real long time ago<br />
Feel me!<br />
I wrote this song a long time ago<br />
It was the dopest song I ever wrote<br />
In &#8217;94</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the club starts exchanging strange looks, until Tupac&#8217;s lyrics begin to start commenting on the appearance and behavior of everyone there. &#8220;Go home!&#8221; Tupac tells Dave. &#8220;I&#8217;m not alive!&#8221;</p>

Didn&#8217;t that get old when I was still in high school? </em></p>
<p>But Dave Chappelle is our comedy Tupac. He wasn&#8217;t shot (except by Wayne Brady in that sketch), but he vanished just as quickly. He did so much, so fast, that we forgive him for the times that he wasn&#8217;t so great, and are willing to accept the dribs and drabs, the poorly-edited outtakes, because it&#8217;s all we have left. And we&#8217;re still waiting for word that he just might still be around, under the radar, without an audience, working on something great.</p>
<p>The audience&#8217;s laughter bothers me. It was what bothered Dave, too, so much that he left it all behind when he was still on top.</p>
