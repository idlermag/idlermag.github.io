										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>There’s just something in that face that takes you into an area that’s very dark, personally dark, and heartbroken.</p>
<p>&mdash;Sidney Lumet (director, <em>Dog Day Afternoon</em>)</p></blockquote>

He’s the kind of man you want to protect and take care of, but also get busy with at the same time. As creepy of an assessment as that may sound on my part, I felt oddly exonerated when I heard most everyone who was close to Cazale say basically the same thing&mdash;albeit more tactfully&mdash;in the first documentary ever about the actor, <em>I Knew It Was You: Rediscovering John Cazale</em> (2009) by director Richard Shepard. </p>
<p>It’s an apt title. Although Cazale never became a household name, even non-cinema-buffs will still recognize him from his role as Fredo Corleone, the infamously betraying brother to Al Pacino’s Michael in the <em>Godfather</em> films. Cazale only appeared in five movies before his life was painfully cut short, and as the documentary points out, all of them received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture. But even though a heartfelt interview in <em>I Knew It Was You</em> reveals Al Pacino himself saying, “I think I learned more about acting from John than [from] anybody,” Cazale never received an Oscar nomination. </p>
<blockquote><p>John Cazale elevated the people around him. He knew that part of his job was not only to play his own characters with integrity, but to play them in such a way that made the other characters credible.</p>
<p>—Mark Harris (film historian)</p></blockquote>

When you watch him in a role you don’t think, &#8220;There’s a despicable worm,&#8221; or, &#8220;There’s a disposable villain,&#8221; you feel awash with a myriad of conflicting emotions that range from aversion to tenderness. It’s strange to empathize with characters who have a seemingly complete lack of principle, and yet when Cazale plays them, you do. They exist alongside the strong characters who make all the right choices&mdash;or at least all the successful ones&mdash;but for these amorphous men, integrity is not only not enough of a driving force, it is a moot one. They are so mired in insecurity, failure and shame that it’s not that the challenge of making the right decision is too daunting, it is so utterly beyond the scope of the characters’ developmental capabilities as to be irrelevant. The doomed characters in any piece are often some of the most fascinating. The world is a harder place for them, and they are pushed to choose wrong; slated to fail from the start. They aren’t weak because they choose to be, they’re weak because that’s truly the best they can do. And yet, Cazale makes them fully-realized people. He makes them vulnerable.</p>
<p>Vulnerable. Shepard’s documentary contains a wealth of interviews with others about the actor’s personal and professional life, and &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; was the magic word used to describe Cazale’s acting by nearly everyone who knew or knew of him. It was undoubtedly one of the many things that made him so appealing to women, including Meryl Streep (yes, Meryl Streep), who was Cazale’s devoted fiancee at the time of his 1978 death from lung cancer. There’s a great respect and reverence surrounding the actor when he’s spoken about by colleagues and friends, even as they affectionately recount peculiarities that sound suspiciously like obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2179" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179" data-attachment-id="2179" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/08/the-strong-weak-man/cazale-streep/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/cazale-streep.jpg" data-orig-size="560,375" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="cazale-streep" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/cazale-streep.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/cazale-streep.jpg?w=560" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/cazale-streep.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="Cazale and Streep" title="cazale-streep" width="300" height="200" class="size-medium wp-image-2179" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/cazale-streep.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/cazale-streep.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/cazale-streep.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179" class="wp-caption-text">John Cazale and Meryl Streep</p></div> Streep’s discreet description of the man she loved coupled with Pacino’s impassioned admiration of his friends’ exceptional relationship speaks volumes about the realness of the bond Streep and Cazale shared. She was only 27 when Cazale died (he was 42), and he had already been diagnosed with lung cancer before he appeared in <em>The Deer Hunter</em> (1978), in which Streep also appeared. Director Michael Cimino was opposed to casting Cazale because his illness made him &#8220;un-insurable,&#8221; which roughly translates to, &#8220;If he dies before the movie is finished, it will cost too much to reshoot every scene he was in with a new actor.&#8221; In the end, it was colleague and friend Robert De Niro who ensured John could appear in what would be the last film of his life.</p>
<p>“Bob De Niro went to bat for John,” Streep said. “He won’t tell me because he’s a very generous person, but I think he secured the bond on John’s participation.”</p>
<p>“He was sicker than we thought, but I wanted him to be in it,” Robert De Niro said.</p>
<p>With a rearranged shooting schedule, Cazale completed all his scenes and gave an unparalleled performance that was in no way marred by his illness.</p>
<p>He died before <em>The Deer Hunter</em> was released.</p>
<p><em>I Knew It Was You</em> is a lovely appreciation by Richard Shepard of an underappreciated actor, with some never-before-seen dvd extras that contain a couple black-and-white film shorts Cazale shot and appeared in in the 60s. It’s also a great holiday gift idea for fans of <em>The Godfather</em>, film documentary or 70s cinema. Or if there’s someone like me on your list who loves to see unconventional men finally get the accolades they deserve.</p>
<blockquote><p>His compassion for [the] people he was portraying, and the sort-of responsibility he felt to a fictional character as if it were a real soul—that made him go that deep into his characters and do beautiful, beautiful work.</p>
<p>—Meryl Streep </p></blockquote>

Though he died at age 63 in 1987, Marvin is one of those guys who had always looked old, and made it work for him. Not unlike his contemporary, Charles Bronson, Marvin was a true man’s man. Tough when he has to be, sweet when he needs to be, Marvin could melt a woman’s heart and break a man’s face; all at the same time if the occasion called for it. Throughout his 35-year career Lee Marvin portrayed a number of memorable bad-asses like Major John Reisman in <em>The Dirty Dozen</em> or Walker in <em>Point Blank</em>. For me, his most memorable bad-ass role is perhaps Nick Devlin in the criminally under-seen <em>Prime Cut</em> (1972).</p>
<p><em>Prime Cut</em> opened in June 1972 to little fanfare and inevitable obscurity. Lee Marvin portrays the aforementioned Nick Devlin, an enforcer for the Chicago mob who is sent to the farmlands of Kansas to collect a debt from Mary Ann, a gangster who runs his operation out of a slaughterhouse and specializes in human slavery. Mary Ann is a tricky individual and Devlin finds himself stalking his prey through barns, county fairs and cornfields. Did I mention that Mary Ann is male and is played by the one and only Gene Hackman?  Prime Cut is not your average crime thriller to be sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1877" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/11/19/certified-bad-ass/primecut-1024-1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg" data-orig-size="1024,759" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="primecut-1024-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=222" alt="Bad-ass" title="primecut-1024-1" width="300" height="222" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1877" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=222 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg?w=600&amp;h=444 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/primecut-1024-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=111 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a> Halfway through the film, Nick Devlin finds himself chased through a cornfield by Mary Ann’s goons and a harvester. In a moment slyly reminiscent of <em>North by Northwest</em>, we see Devlin desperately attempting to outrun the harvester, which looms ominously in the background, much like the plane that attempted to dive-bomb Cary Grant. Just in the nick of time, one of Devlin’s men runs a car into the thresher leaving the machine to digest the car in bales of twisted metal and glass. Later, following a shoot-out in a field of sunflowers, Devlin commandeers a truck and drives it straight through one of Mary Ann’s giant greenhouses, collapsing the entire thing.</p>
<p>What sets apart <em>Prime Cut</em> from your typical crime film is its colorful characters and refreshing change of scenery. Devlin is a fish out of water, a hardened man lost in the innocence of back-country Kansas cornfields. While he’s an enforcer for a criminal empire, he is a man of heart, as evidenced by woman he saves from Mary Ann’s slave trade and uses as &#8220;collateral.&#8221; Mary Ann, on the other hand, is a tough, brooding figure who uses the unassuming back country as his playground. For him, the human body is a currency in and of itself. He holes women up in cattle cages and auctions off their bodies to the highest bidders. He grinds a man’s flesh into sausage&mdash;literally sausage&mdash;and sends it to a rival as a message. Lee Marvin is certainly not alone in being a “Certified Bad-ass.” Charles Bronson, Yul Brenner, and Warren Oates hold similar status and Gene Hackman most assuredly reaches it in <em>Prime Cut</em>.</p>
<p>I look at today’s roster of actors and film fans, we have a severe lack of “Certified Bad-asses” in our day and age. The traditional action star is long gone. I’m interested to know who you think would rank as a “Certified Bad-ass” today. For me, guys like Jason Statham and Jet Li certainly have their moments of Bad-assery but don’t have that full package that guys like Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson had. So let’s hear it. Who is a “Certified Bad-ass”?</p>

I know; it would&#8217;ve been so easy for me to just lie. But I first watched the miniseries when I was nineteen, so I feel there is some wiggle room as I would&#8217;ve been unlikely to really absorb the books properly too many years before that.</p>
<p><em>I, Claudius</em> is probably the best miniseries of all time. In fact, I think the miniseries format in general should enjoy a resurgence. So many fantastic books with great story-beats&mdash;ideal for episode breaks&mdash;get compressed down to the admittedly more-ideal format of film, and in the process shed the extra weight of some of truly rich story aspects. But the slower pace that so many miniseries thrive within is not as <em>en vogue</em> today as it was in the 70s, now that the storytelling ideal for any entertainment genre is so tightly-edited and succinct. Get in, say your piece, and move on.</p>
<p>But <em>I, Claudius</em> is anything but slow. Every moment of it is riveting and it&#8217;s THIRTEEN HOURS. I have heard the thirteen-episode epic fall under the &#8220;pop&#8221; or &#8220;camp&#8221; umbrella&mdash;mostly because it&#8217;s 34 years old and has metallic eyeshadows&mdash;but I still think of it as ART. Art, plus the naked. I should pretend to be so artsy that I was unfazed by the naughty bits, but I noticed them. They come right away in the second scene as if to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t turn that dial! This may be a dense, literary, beautifully acted period piece, but there&#8217;s sex! We promise!&#8221; Oh those lovely Brits and their progressive laws on television nudity. And on nudity&#8217;s place in the arts. As is typical of British productions, the sauciness of <em>I, Claudius</em> in no way detracts from the artistry of it, nor from the fact that it sports some of the most respected actors of the era, giving some of the most memorable performances of their careers.</p>
<p>The books are from the point of view of downtrodden, punching-bag-turned-honest-to-goodness-Roman-Emperor Claudius, whose story is told though Graves&#8217; interpretations of a number of ancient sources&mdash;letters, texts, and the telltale holes in found in both: gaps attributed to the family&#8217;s embarrassment of, apathy toward, and derision of Claudius, who is now believed to have had cerebral palsy. The most significant absence of information of course is the Emperor Claudius&#8217; real, actual eight-book autobiography, mysteriously lost forever, like the <em><a>London After Midnight</a></em> of Roman times. The loss of archaic historical tomes is no laughing matter, although some may argue it a blessing in this case because without the autobiographies&#8217; absence, Graves would never have drawn the concept to craft his now-revered works, which in turn basically created the entire genre of historical fiction in 1934.</p>

I had already fallen in love with Jacobi in my own introduction to the actor as Brother Cadfael, the mystery-solving monk in the 90s British TV series from the novels by Ellis Peters. Jacobi-as-Cadfael is one of my holy trinity of &#8220;actors as characters whom I wish I could glean advice and wisdom from in real life&#8221;; the other two being Stephen Fry as Jeeves in <em>Jeeves &amp; Wooster</em> and Sr. Ian McKellen as Gandalf in <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (McKellen himself is said to have had a crush on the one-year-older Jacobi while they were both students at Cambridge in the 1950s: &#8220;a passion that was undeclared and unrequited,&#8221; McKellen has said.)</p>

In <em>I, Claudius</em> he ages from approximately 20 to 64, complete with the historically-cited stammer, limp, and tic, as well as Jacobi&#8217;s own courageous, tenacious tenderness that sucks your heart and empathy into the screen. Followed up by Jacobi are the incomparable Brian Blessed as Emperor Augustus and Sian Phillips as Augustus&#8217; love-to-hate-her wife, Livia. Blessed uses his trademark booming voice (he has been called the &#8220;loudest man alive&#8221;) and warm intensity to paint Augustus as a human, reluctant ruler, and Philips in turn is perfect as the beautiful, cold, ruthless matriarch and driving force behind many of the men and much of the tragedy in the piece.</p>
<p>It would take too long to go down the entire roster of the fantastic, enormous cast (look for a very young, curly-headed Patrick Stewart as the ambitious and virile Lucius Sejanus, as well as Patricia Quinn&mdash;almost unrecognizable to those who remember her as Magenta from <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> only a year earlier&mdash;as Livilla), but it would also be impossible to talk about <em>I, Claudius</em> without mentioning the actor who played one of history&#8217;s most famous, colorful and despicable Roman Emperors: John Hurt, in the role of Caligula. Hurt is one of my favorite actors of all time, and in fact when I was in Chicago recently with my fiance and his colleagues, and found out I&#8217;d missed eating at a restaurant two blocks away where John Hurt was dining at the very same moment, I kind of wanted to drop to my knees on the sidewalk and weep.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1809" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1809" data-attachment-id="1809" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/11/17/of-emperors-and-prophetic-chickens/jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula.jpg" data-orig-size="284,188" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula.jpg?w=284" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula.jpg?w=284" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula.jpg?w=640" alt="Caligula" title="jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula"   class="size-full wp-image-1809" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula.jpg 284w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/jacobi-with-john-hurt-as-caligula.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1809" class="wp-caption-text">Jacobi and John Hurt as Caligula</p></div> Hurt blows Caligula out of the water in <em>I, Claudius</em>, and even though other actors have taken on the loathsome and puzzling ruler in various manifestations before and since, I&#8217;m afraid Hurt has ruined me for all other portrayals of Caligula. Anyone who has seen the series will clearly remember Hurt&#8217;s impassioned, uncomfortable Dance of the Dawn in drag, or when he slinks out of his bed chamber with blood all over his false beard after the butchering of his pregnant sister Drusilla, and just breathes the words, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go in there.&#8221; But perversion and spectacle aside, it&#8217;s Hurt&#8217;s downright disturbing and haunting portrayal of Caligula that makes it so memorable, showing him as a raving mad, childlike sadist who should never been given any moncrum of power, and who truly, truly didn&#8217;t know what to do with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m delighted to learn that there is <a target="new" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/12/derek-jacobi-claudius-radio-4">a new brand new audio dramatization of <em>I, Claudius</em></a> being chipped away at right now for BBC Radio 4, and happy to add to the heaps of excitement, anticipation and reverence already surrounding the new production. Jacobi is returning to the drama, this time in the role of Augustus. I can&#8217;t wait. And I&#8217;m sure the folks over at <a target="new" href="http://www.sepulchritude.com/suffer/volumethree/claudius.html">Not My Head! The I, Claudius Drinking Game</a> website are looking forward to some new inspiration too.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m in a group called the Crafty Beavers.

<blockquote><strong>Beaver</strong>&#8212;a large, amphibious rodent of the genus Castor,  having sharp incisors, webbed hind feet, and a flattened tail, noted for its ability to dam streams with trees, branches, etc.</blockquote>

How can I describe these beavers who craft?  This has proven difficult for me in the past few days.  So many halted starts and I can’t do the beavers justice.

How do I love the beavers?  Let me count the ways.

A beaver by any other name would smell as . . wait, no.  Dammit.

<p>A beaver by any other name would smell as . . wait, no.  Dammit.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>Slang: Vulgar</strong></em><br />
<strong>a.</strong>a woman&#8217;s pubic area.<br />
<strong>b.</strong><em>offensive</em>. a woman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, we beavers are mostly women (though we’ve had a few top notch male knitters on occasion) who regularly carve time out of our busy schedules to craft.  </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Idiom</strong>: Busy as a beaver&mdash;meaning industrious, hard working.  </p></blockquote>
<p>We meet a few times a month and we share space, gossip, food, stories, friendship, advice, scissors, expertise, dramas, traumas and the beaver list goes on and on.  We surround ourselves with pretzel M&amp;M’s, delicious baked goods, wine, beer, diet soda and gummy creatures of myriad variety.  Religious icons like Buffy, Daria. Laura Ingalls or Beatrix Kiddo bless our gatherings from a T.V. on in the background.  There’s usually a dog or cat on hand grumpily bemoaning the loss of their couch space or rifling through a bag of supplies.  </p>
<p>“Please, ma’am, can you spare a salt and vinegar chip?” my dachshund begs.  No, long dog, beavers need their salt fix.  </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Crafty Beaver</strong>&mdash;an individual who creates homespun crafts.  Often a feminist of dirty and addled mind.  An artsy follower of Amy Sedaris.  Anyone who belongs to a club of crafters.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our chapter (I imagine there are lots of other chapters, why wouldn’t there be?) I’d say we have a ruling body consisting of the die-hard, rarely miss a meeting beaver clan. </p>
<p>This executive board consists of:<br />
Me&mdash;artsy dabbler, paint pen enthusiast, sharpie hoarder, portrait artist.<br />
Andrea&mdash;experimental chef, crochet diva, purse-maker, idea gal<br />
Elizabeth&mdash;blanket tatter, quilting queen, problem solver, craft technician<br />
Emily&mdash;jewelry maker, constructor of hats, rebel seamstress, create-a-tron</p>
<p>For a ruling body, we’re pretty liberal.  The first rule of beaving is . . . well, we never actually formed any rules about beaving.  As a unit, we’re pretty against phallocentric paternalistic bullshit.</p>
<blockquote><p>To beave is to craft with feminist zeal.&mdash;Meg</p></blockquote>
<p>Our club forms itself at each meeting; we make ourselves up as we go along.  It’s different each time depending on the people who come.   We find a way of hanging together.  We negotiate the gaps and construct new connections.  </p>
<p>Our most recent meeting, for example, culled a few newish faces.  While painting comedian Margaret Cho in the Virgen de Guadalupe’s sunburst body halo (it’s okay, she let Cho borrow it) I listened to get a feel for this burgeoning version of our beaver clan.  </p>
<p>Madhu sits cool, erect and spits the cleanest, driest, vitriolic phrases.  </p>
<p>We tell stories of freak pet accidents, the tragedies of rodents, long deceased.  A solemn mistake.  A wet hamster and a hair dryer.  </p>
<p><strong>Madhu</strong>:  That’s too bad.  Hamsters are really more air-dry anyway.</p>
<p>She doesn’t bat a kohl-lined eye.</p>
<p>The conversation ebbs and flows.  Katie is irritated by the lack of sex shops in East Lansing.  Emily thinks they are outlawed in our college town.  Katie is practically trembling with protestation.  The gears are turning-&mdash;<strong>How can we prepare a feminist flash mob?!</strong>  Madhu has a campaign idea.</p>
<p><strong>Madhu</strong>:  “Stimulate the economy.”</p>
<p>Dead.  Pan.</p>
<p>Katie, a radical femme feminist gymnast/teacher/writer/poet in combat boots sculpting wee turtles out of yarn will take to her twitter page later that night:</p>
<p><strong>“Dear women: your breasts are an offense to the public peace &amp; order. It says so right there in Ch. 26 Article II of EL municipal code.”</strong></p>
<p>I fidget my fingers like Mr. Burns, Yeeeeehhhsss.  These are good initiates.</p>
<blockquote><p>Beaving is a collective re-visioning of domestic space.&mdash;Andrea</p></blockquote>
<p>We beavers are a strange breed and we like that about ourselves.  Here, I have to give a nod to Big Mama Beaver, Amy Sedaris, from whom we took our name.  I started referring to us as beavers after hearing that the darkly quirky comedian was the president of her own group called the Crafty Beavers.</p>
<p>Her book, <em>I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence</em> really encapsulates where us modern day crafters are coming from.  With both nostalgic respect and healthy disgust toward women’s domesticity and the projects of homemaking, Sedaris manages to offer useful tips while critiquing feminine work and space.  In this book one can learn how to make a delicious pecan pie and how best to mourn the loss of your favorite pet.  She proffers proper etiquette for hosting and attending a party and how best to aid a high friend, depending on their drug of choice.  We learn how to make a googley eyed centerpiece and the ins and outs of scrubbing the period stains from your panties.  This woman is chock full of advice!  </p>
<p>The pictures in the book capture the 70s, the clear target of her nostalgic longings, yet they do not elevate the subject matter into a frothy dream of the era.  Creepy vintage tschotskes peek out behind (or out of) a casserole, the food is shot so realistically that it shows the yummy/grossness of the meals. </p>
<blockquote><p>
A beaver has a love and/or appreciation for tackiness and/or kitsch.&mdash;Emily</p></blockquote>
<p>Working against the myths of feminine perfection and the pristine happy home, she takes a kitschy joy in exposing the dirty underbelly of the sacred seat of womanhood.</p>
<p>People will poop or vomit in your house.  Underwear will get dirty.  Your bunny will die.</p>
<p>Martha Stewart may not talk about these things, but a beaver would, and she’d help you build a bunny coffin while she did.  </p>
<p><em>Pass the glitter?</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Films are time capsules. They reflect the trends of the era: The fashion, the cars, and the political climate. Nowhere is this more evident than in the films of the 70s. Just as film was evolving, we were evolving as a nation. Presidential scandals are fairly commonplace now but in 1972 the nation was rocked by Watergate. That, coupled with the growing dissatisfaction with the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, created a climate of unrest and mistrust with the government and it wasn’t long before those feelings translated to film. Thus, a niche genre was created in 1974 that had a healthy life throughout the decade: The paranoid thriller.

In a paranoid thriller you don’t know who to trust. You don’t trust your friends, you don’t trust your government and you certainly don’t trust your lover. Your home isn’t safe. <em>Maybe it’s been bugged</em>. You don’t go to the police. <em>Maybe they’re in on it</em>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 100+ year history of cinema, there is no doubt in my mind that the 70s represented the best era of filmmaking. It was a time driven by creativity, not box office. Films were driven by character, not plot and CGI was a meaningless acronym. Modern cinema evolved from the rules that were broken during this decade of decadence. The word “fuck” was first uttered in a major studio film in 1970. Sex became more graphic. Violence became more realistic. Even the summer blockbuster was invented in 1975. Modern masters like Scorsese, Coppola, Spielberg, and DePalma were mere novices paving the road to the future at twenty-four frames per second. Film today would not be where it is without the trends set in the 70s.</p>

The goal is for the audience to share the paranoia and confusion of the main character. </p>

Playing as almost a direct reaction to Watergate, it’s perhaps the epitome of the genre. <em>The Conversation</em> chronicles Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), an expert in wiretapping and surveillance, as he becomes increasingly unhinged by his inability to interpret a recording of what may or may not be a murder plot. The irony is that Caul is an expert in invading other people’s privacy yet is obsessed and consumed with maintaining his own, even living off the grid (or as off the grid you can get in 1974).  Typically in a paranoid thriller the hero turns to his friends for help, but Caul has alienated all his friends here with his intense obsession with his privacy. The film’s haunting final shot perhaps serves as the defining image of this sub-genre.</p>

Interestingly, <em>The Conversation</em> and <em>The Parallax View</em> both use the plot device of our hero being unwittingly tricked. Not only can the hero not trust the people around him, he can’t even trust himself. <em>Parallax</em> also uses Warren Beatty’s 70s cool to its advantage to create an engaging hero as opposed to Gene Hackman’s troubled and icy Harry Caul.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_214" style="width: 116px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" data-attachment-id="214" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/03/panic-in-the-70s/condor/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/condor.jpg" data-orig-size="354,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="condor" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/condor.jpg?w=212" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/condor.jpg?w=354" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/condor.jpg?w=106&#038;h=150" alt="Three Days of the Condor" title="condor" width="106" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-214" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/condor.jpg?w=106&amp;h=150 106w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/condor.jpg?w=212&amp;h=300 212w" sizes="(max-width: 106px) 100vw, 106px" /><p id="caption-attachment-214" class="wp-caption-text">Three Days of the Condor</p></div>Robert Redford must have been particularly paranoid in the 70s since he appears in two notable paranoid thrillers, <em>Three Days of the Condor</em> (1975) and <em>All the President’s Men</em> (1976).  <em>Condor</em> tells the story of a CIA analyst who is literally out to lunch when his entire field office is assassinated. He finds himself on the run from not only the assassins but from his own employer, which may have been behind the hit. <em>All the President’s Men</em> (or <em>ATPM</em> as my friends and I call it) is a cinematic version of Watergate detailing the reporters who helped uncover the scandal. While <em>ATPM</em> covers its source accurately and professionally, <em>Condor</em> takes a more cinematic approach that makes for a film that’s more fun. <em>Condor</em> is also the most aggressive of these thrillers in taking on the government. In this story, the entire CIA may be the enemy.</p>
<p>Other notable paranoid thrillers of the 70s include <em>Marathon Man</em> (1976), the little seen <em>Winter Kills</em> (1979) and, to a more abstract degree, the critically lauded <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> (1978). These films are fun relics of their era and every film listed here is a skillful thriller in its own right. For fans of 70s cinema, these are required viewing but for those interested in broadening their film palette, I suggest you take a walk through this brief but memorable sub-genre. Just make sure you’re watching with someone you trust…</p>
