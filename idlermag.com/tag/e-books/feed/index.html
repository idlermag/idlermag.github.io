										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Nook is dead. It died in mid-March and I haven’t missed it at all. Except every now and then I thought about the book I was in the middle of reading. And once in a while I remembered how nice it was to buy new books from the comfort of my couch. Plus those weekly emails from Barnes and Noble telling me about new releases and book recommendations pretty much kept the device in my head at all times.</p>
<p>So the Nook is dead, long live the Nook. I’m thinking of buying a new one. The main problem with this plan is that the damn thing is so sensitive. One hard drop on the bedroom floor and the screen saver was broken. Instead of cycling through different authors it stuck with one face until I woke it up to read, then a new face would appear. I was taking the Nook to bed in what turned out to be a much darker room than I anticipated. Bam, I ran into the bed, dropping my phone and the e-reader. The phone is fine by the way. I have dropped my iPhone about a million times and every once in a while I can only hold conversations over speaker phone but the next time I drop it, it fixes itself. This is the kind of technology I need. Self-healing. </p>
<p>The Nook is not self-healing. I got used to seeing one author for days at a time. Sometimes I would wake up the nook just to change the face, Gertrude Stein is a little too handsome of a woman for me to have staring at me from the coffee table for days on end.</p>
<p>The next time I dropped, it the results were a little more destructive. You think I would have bought a case for it after dropping it the first time. Not me. It was fine, therefore it was tough enough to survive my lifestyle. Things end up on the floor a lot in my life. I think I can pick up just one more thing and everything goes crashing down to the ground. I was carrying the baby in one arm; his change of clothes, a cloth diaper, and the Nook were all tucked under my elbow. Things started to slide and so I tightened my grip on the baby and kept walking down the stairs. </p>
<p>Not the best plan.</p>
<p>Obviously holding the baby above all else is good. But I should have stopped, rearranged, set something down. The Nook fell, hit the wood floor, slid, fell down four steps and landed on the slate tile entryway. I thought nothing of it. It had survived the first fall. It was initiated into my way of life. I scooped it up and went on my merry way. The screen had two vertical stripes through Kurt Vonnegut’s face. No big deal. They were only slightly darker than the surrounding screen. They were a little more noticeable when I turned on the backlight but, let’s face it, I deserved it for not buying a case.</p>
<p>But it was more than lines. The backlight turned on, but nothing else did. I pushed buttons in vain. I couldn’t even turn it off and back on again, my go to electronic fixing move. I held down the power button for over two minutes. Nothing. Finally the battery died. My husband charged it for me but it never turned on again. The Nook was dead. </p>
<p>I decided I didn’t care. I didn’t really like the thing in the first place. I was old school. I liked paper books. I could totally read them while I held a sleeping baby. I went out and bought a new book light that was way too bright and had no dimmer switch. I missed the soft glow of the nook a little. I pushed the thought out of my head. Things would be fine.</p>
<p>The baby kept fussing due to my awkward page turning. My hands are not big enough to hold a 400 plus page book in one hand. I broke a few bindings. My mom spilled juice on a book. The baby kept waking up and turning his head toward the super bright light skinning down on him. I finished a book while holding him and had nothing else to read. I started to miss the Nook in earnest.</p>
<p>Plus there was that book I was in the middle of. I downloaded the Nook reader for my computer after a chat with the Barnes and Noble help crew. I immediately hated it. There is too much going on on my computer for me to be able to read a book. Plus there’s glare. And I can’t snuggle up. The screen is too bright and the battery is dying. I need a new Nook.</p>
<p>This time I’ll be smart. I already picked out a cool orange stripy case. If it isn’t sturdy enough, I’ll hit up Barnes and Noble in the mall and buy something giant to protect it. I’ll buy a screen protector and actually apply it, unlike the screen protector for my phone, which is still in a box somewhere. I’ll carry fewer things down the stairs. And next time I’m holding the baby and the Nook and the Nook starts to slide I’ll be able to let it go, knowing I’ve done my best to protect it. The Nook of course, not the baby.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I bought an e-reader and I don’t like it. It’s not the wrong one for me, I did my research. The Kobo was too small, I don’t like Amazon so no Kindle for me, and the iPad provided too many distractions. I have enough trouble trying to watch TV and Facebook at the same time, I don’t need a tablet with games to read a book. The Nook is lightweight and is backlit for nighttime reading. It has has a cool screen saver of different authors. They are kind enough to provide the names of the authors so I don’t feel too dumb. </p>
<p>But I don’t like it. I want to like it. Or at least have a decent reason for not liking it. At first I was frustrated because there was no way to turn on the screen saver, seemed like a legitimate reason to not like it. Then I looked it up online and found out how to press the home button to turn the screen saver on. So there went that complaint. The battery life is fantastic. The wi-fi works great. I can buy books with a simple tap of the screen. I can search by author or title. I can browse the bestsellers and recommendations based on my downloads. So why don’t I like it?</p>
<p>I bought it because this baby makes reading extremely difficult. He wakes up when I turn the pages of a book. I can only read the smaller paperbacks because I have only one hand available and larger paperbacks are unwieldy. Hardcovers are out of the question. Sometimes the book I want to read isn’t the one that’s closest to me. Being a little tired all the time makes it a lot harder to hold more than one plot in my mind at a time. The Nook solves these problems and more. It’s a bunch of books all in one spot. Tapping the screen turns the page. My booklight died long ago and so I was limited to daylight hours for reading. Not great in Michigan in February. The Nook’s glow light allows me to read in low light or no light. I don’t have to leave the house to buy books. Any parent can tell you convenience is key. But I’m not happy with it.</p>
<p>It’s just not the same. I like reading words on a page and not a screen. I’m old school. I like the feel of pages. I like dog-earring them. I like to underline interesting passages. These feel like weak complaints. The Nook lets me look up words in the dictionary, which is great. I can read newspapers and magazines in addition to books. I wish I liked it more.</p>
<p>I’m going to keep using it, maybe I need more than a week to get used to it. In that week I’ve read a book and a half on my Nook. That’s a lot for me right now. It had been over a week since I had even touched a book before I bought my Nook. This is the best I can do right now. It may feel like a second-rate tool, but at least it will keep me in literature. Maybe the lower prices of ebooks will encourage me to try new authors. I’m pretty sure I can borrow and return library ebooks from the comfort of my couch. There are so many pluses and so few minuses, so I’ll use it. But I won’t like it. </p>
