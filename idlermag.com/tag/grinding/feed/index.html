										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a deep suspicion that upon completing this game, I will have declared it almost good. The menus are clunky, the level grinding would be tiresome if there wasn’t a auto-fight feature (and, even then, it’s annoying) and whenever I kill a boss I feel relief not satisfaction. I will, however, hold off on serious analysis until I get a full party and, presumably, some plot.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s session was a bit long for how little progress I made. I zipped through Restful Peaceful Valley, avoiding as many mobs as I could, to find myself in Happy Happy Village where I could level and money grind with ease.</p>
<p>The level grind is pretty straightforward. There is a mob called the Insane Cultist which grants you 353 experience points a pop AND calls for reinforcements. So, on a good pull, you can walk away with over 1,000 exp. Rinse, repeat for a an hour or so and you’ll faceroll the town’s leader, Carpainter, so you can free Paula and get your first party member (and more inventory space!).</p>
<p>The money grinding takes a little more time. You see, Fresh Eggs, which sell for $12, after about three minutes, will hatch into chickens which sell for $110. But in Happy Happy Village, before you save Paula, there is a pay what you want vendor which get get take eggs for free. So, the majority of my gaming session ran like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get Eggs</li>
<li>Go make myself a hotpocket</li>
<li>Check my twitter feed</li>
<li>Go get ice for bourbon and come back to check on eggs</li>
<li>Realize the bourbon bottle was still in the kitchen</li>
<li>Return to kitchen to fill glass, grab hotpocket, and sell chickens in game</li>
</ul>
<p>Rinse, repeat, and you effectively have infinite money and a real good buzz.</p>
<p>So, with a new party member and flush with cash, I returned to Twosome to restock on one of the more essential items in the game, <a href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Teddy_Bear" target="_blank">the Teddy Bear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In battle, Teddy Bears will occasionally (75% of the time for normal attacks) take hits from oncoming enemies for Ness and his friends. Some attacks like PSI Magnet will always target them and are ineffective. The Teddy Bear has approximately 100 HP, and after taking enough damage, will be reduced to a mere pile of fluff and removed from the inventory of whichever character was wielding it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, during my internet travels, I found a trick to heal your bear: simply give it to Escargo Express, the item storage delivery/pick-up service, and, the next time you retrieve it, the health is restored.</p>
<p>That’s really all I got this week, I am looking forward to barreling through more of the story so I can begin to understand what makes Daniel love this game so much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the screenshot, I am not entirely sure about this game.</p>
<p>The game mechanics themselves are uninspired. Kill stuff and gain experience to get new abilities and increase incomprehensible stats at a mathematically consistent rate. And, as I mentioned last time, the enemies are brutal, a misplaced heal and you&#8217;re done, which means a lot of reloading and lost progress (early game, anyway, we’ll see how it pans out in the future).</p>
<p>I am not also not sure whether I love or hate the auto-fight option. There is something weird about letting a game play itself and if it’s actually required to make a game playable you can replace the word “weird” with “terrible.”</p>
<p>Here are thoughts that actually ran through my mind during my last session:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Let me check my email real quick”</li>
<li>“I better check twitter while I am at it and find out what this Qwickster nonsense is all about.”</li>
<li>“I wonder if I will miss anything if I mute the sound and watch some bad anime at the same time”</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, these are not good signs. I can only hope the quirkiness starts to really grab me.</p>

<p>I was pretty stoked about this time traveling bee dude that appeared to tell me how I was going to save the world, then helps me beat down a terrifying alien only to get squashed later by a friend’s mom. This made me sad.</p>
<p>I just don’t know folks, I’m willing to keep plugging away, but quirkiness alone might not be able to carry this game.</p>

<p>This game doesn’t mess around.</p>
<p>You are thrown right into the action.  There isn’t a lengthy prologue intro like some other games (*cough* <em>Zelda</em> *cough*).  Our hero, Cloud, jumps off a train and starts fights with Shinra guards.  Bam.  Let’s go.</p>
<p>It reminds of a storytelling technique: “Start the story as late as possible,” also known as <em>in medias res</em>.  We don’t need to see Cloud meeting Barret and talking about the plan, nor do we need to see them boarding the train in the first place.</p>
<p>Dropping the player into a fast-paced action scene first thing in the game is a great way to lure them in&mdash;what do I do?  Where am I going?  What will happen next?</p>
<p>Look at the opening of the film <em>The Dark Knight</em> as a comparison:</p>
<p>It starts with the bank robbers breaking into the bank, not with them planning it out or preparing.  It sets the tone and allows for character development via their actions within the intense scene (in this case, the Joker’s cunning and ruthlessness).</p>
<p><strong>What do we learn in the opening minutes of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Barret has no problem blowing up a huge reactor in the middle of a crowded city.  Cloud is an elite fighter-for-hire who could care less about Barret’s political and environmental beliefs.  Barret is dedicated to his cause and for him, the ends justify the bloody means.  Cloud has no qualms against selling his services to such a man.  In-<em>tense</em>.</p>
<p>And in 1997 they had no problem using the word “terrorist” in the game.  And that’s what Barret is&mdash;an eco-terrorist.  He’s blowing up mako reactors (which leads to death of innocents) to send a message to Shinra.</p>
<p>What I also liked is that there wasn’t a twenty-minute tutorial on how to play the game before you get to start playing.  This is something I’ve noticed more and more in recent games&mdash;they show you how to play before you can do anything.</p>
<p>C’mon. I just wanna play.</p>
<p>I decided to keep all of my character names at their defaults, but my follow FFVII blogger Andrew <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/23/ffvii/">has a great set of naming rules</a>.</p>
<p>The level design of this game still blows me away, and now that I’m older I get some of the visual references.  I see a lot of influence from the 1927 film <em>Metropolis</em> in the layout of Midgar, namely the “rich” city above ground with the slums below (as well as the city relying on dangerous machines for power).</p>
<p>Man, I love that I can just hold down the OK button to auto-select FIGHT in battles.  It speeds things up considerably.</p>
<p><strong>On Level Building:</strong></p>
<p>I’m the kind of player who will spend a day or so getting into random encounters to level up early in a RPG.  Sure, it can be boring at times&mdash;but it tends to save me a few headaches later on when I can beat baddies with ease.  Plus, it helps pad the wallet and levels up materia faster.</p>
<p>After the reactor explosion, Barret wants to blow up a <em>second</em>.  This guy is nuts.  But, he is also a devoted father, which we learn post-explosion back in the slums.  He’s one complex dude.</p>
<p>We also meet the first part of Cloud’s eventual love triangle, Tifa.</p>
<p>Oh, Tifa.  A badass fighter woman with uh. . . ”huge tracks of land.”  What more could a sixteen-year-old boy hope for in a video game in the 1990s?</p>
<p>Before heading out for the second terrorist attack, I did a bit of level-building in the train grave yard.  I also earned enough gil to equip each of my characters (Cloud, Barret and Tifa) with Restore materia.  I’ve played way more <em>Final Fantasy</em> games since I last played <em>VII</em>, so I know that being able to heal is a good thing.</p>
<p>After the second reactor explosion, we meet the rest of the love triangle, Aeris.  Two women fighting over Cloud?  This was like crack to a sixteen-year-old boy, I tell ya.  Years later, it still makes for great story telling.</p>
<p>I forgot how much I loved the music for this game too.</p>
