										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an absurd collision with teammate Wayne Simmonds’s knee, Claude Giroux is now the third Flyer to jump on the concussion bandwagon. Sydney Crosby is out <em>again</em> due to concussion symptoms, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/sports/hockey/derek-boogaard-a-boy-learns-to-brawl.html" target="_blank">this series</a> about the life and death of Derek Boogaard in <em>The New York Times</em> has swirled up all kinds of head trauma coverage. In fact, since my <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/12/01/coming-to-a-head/" target="_blank">last column</a>, the number of players with head injuries is up to thirteen and the debate over what to do about hockey&#8217;s head trauma problem has only intensified.</p>
<p>Despite my efforts to read about other things — like the league realignment or the recent spate of coaching changes — I find I’ve developed something of a tic whereby my finger “involuntarily” moves the cursor toward any link with the SEO keywords: hockey, fighting, CTE, or head trauma. Or: Flyers (at least I’m honest). To say I’m a little obsessed with the topic is dangerously close to an understatement.</p>
<p>Strangely, this predicament has caused some struggles in the writing department. <em>The Idler</em> doesn’t demand coverage of the latest he-said/she-said, but in this case I can’t seem to focus on anything else.</p>
<p>The other day, though, I decided to embrace my obsession after reading a <em>Times</em> article that polled neurosurgeons and neuropsychologists for their opinions on what the NHL should do to protect its players, particularly with regard to fighting. While most people would expect doctors to offer a scientific basis for new regulations or new protective equipment, many of the experts cited said that the science surrounding the long-term risks of head trauma is uncertain. Therefore, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that NHL <em>must</em> take action at all.</p>
<p>As one neurologist <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/sports/hockey/in-debate-about-fighting-in-hockey-medical-experts-weigh-in.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=sports&amp;src=me" target="_blank">put it</a>, referencing the league’s decision to ban checks to the head a few years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In essence, I would say there’s no more evidence that fighting is bad for the brain than there is that hits to the head are bad for the brain. The amount of evidence is the same — essentially, very little. Yet the decision was made on a policy level: let’s take head shots out of the game. There’s no more evidence, or less, for head shots than there is for fighting.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The doctors raise an excellent point: this isn’t a science imperative, it’s a policy decision. In other words, evaluating the decision to forbid fighting (or not) in the context of policymaking offers an important lens through which to view this controversy. By separating what science can tell us about the long-term risks of head trauma (caused by fighting or otherwise) from the policy decision the NHL can make with the information available, it is easier to understand where all the disagreement stems from.</p>
<p>It may seem like I’m heading down a path already tread by Gary Bettman who, so far, has demurred from fighting restrictions. But a) separating the policy decision from the scientific uncertainty has not changed my conviction that fighting should be eliminated from hockey and b) acknowledging that the science linking head trauma to side effects, like CTE, is murky does not amount to a rejection of new head protection regulations in the NHL. On the contrary, this new framework merely suggests that science cannot form the sole basis for decision-making.</p>
<p>My day job involves energy and climate policy, so the first rough analogy that springs to my mind is climate change (a stretch, I know, but bear with me). Like concussions in hockey (or football, for that matter), scientific evidence supports the claim that global climate change is happening. Scientists, however, can’t yet predict with certainty the extent of the risk posed by a warming planet.</p>
<p>This uncertainty has complicated the climate policy discourse because it opens the door for the influence of values, politics, and ultimately, bitter disagreement. Some believe the apocalypse is imminent and there is an urgent need for extreme policy intervention, some say climate change is a hoax and no policy is necessary, and others land somewhere in the middle, recognizing that the possibility of catastrophic climate change is sufficient validation for some sort of policy intervention that promotes human development while protecting the most vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>To acknowledge this uncertainty demands that you wrestle with two important decisions: 1) to take policy action at all (values); 2) if we decide to use policy, what type of policy lever is appropriate given the uncertain risk (politics)?</p>
<p>That’s where the debate begins for climate policy and, interestingly, also for head trauma. From a policy standpoint, science is just one part of the equation. Values and politics play a critical role in designing policy, too.</p>
<p>When it comes to hockey, values include the integrity of the game, player health, the life quality of former players, and the entertainment potential. The politics may be influenced by the impact on the fan base, NHL coaches, and the players themselves. From this standpoint, any policy action undertaken by the NHL, if it is to be effective, will need to take all of these factors into account, instead of simply relying on an assumed scientific imperative (or lack thereof).</p>
<p>No one wants to see Sid or any other hockey player suffer the way Derek Boogaard did. But not everyone draws a clear line from Boogaard&#8217;s CTE and his untimely death to his career as an NHL enforcer. If you understand that the science connecting CTE, fighting, and head trauma is uncertain then that opinion has to be just as legitimate as one that says the line between CTE and head trauma is clear enough to take serious action.</p>
<p>A policymaking perspective does not necessarily resolve the head trauma debate. It certainly <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/green_room/2010/03/the_trouble_with_climate_science.html" target="_blank">hasn’t led to any resolution of the climate debate</a>, as yet. I guess my hope is that this more nuanced approach gives all interested parties the tools to make a more thorough, insightful case that advances the sport, but not at the expense of its players skulls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong> He&#8217;s <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/raburry01-bat.shtml" target="_blank">a mediocre hitter</a> who <a href="http://beck.mlblogs.com/2011/06/06/ryan-raburn-and-track-records/" target="_blank">heats up as the season wears on</a> but doesn&#8217;t really seem to learn much as the years advance. To wit, his strikeouts have been nearly dead even with—or eclipsed—his hit total every year he&#8217;s recorded stats in the majors.</p>
<p>Despite having played alongside some of the best hitters in terms of creating quality at bats—Placido Polanco, Miguel Cabrera—Raburn seems, more often than not, to just swing at whatever pitch comes after strike two. And miss. As a fan, that&#8217;s frustrating. How can he not learn? Doesn&#8217;t the osmotic effect of just sharing an oxygen supply with these hitters translate into more plate discipline?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> He&#8217;s a defensive nightmare.</p>
<p>He misplays the ball in left more often than he gets it right, almost to comic effect. (Side note: that he sometimes laughs it off is either endearing or maddening, take your pick.)</p>

<p>And of course, there are legions of Tigers fans who heap all the blame for the bonus game loss to the Minnesota Twins—which officially eliminated the Tigers from the playoffs, something they&#8217;d been desperately trying to do on their own since the All-Star break—on Raburn because <a href="http://eyeofthetigers.com/tag/game-163/" target="_blank">he, yes, misplayed the ball</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Raburn&#8217;s just a guy in need of, as someone said of a colleague I cannot believe will ever rise to meet his job duties, just a little more confidence. But looking at him, you wonder if maybe that&#8217;s not part of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://lansinghitclub.com" target="_blank">My coach</a> reminds me that production at the plate starts with confidence: confidence that you&#8217;re making the right choice in laying off that ball out of the strike zone even though your protect-the-plate instinct is trigger happy with any count ending in -2, and—compounding and augmenting that first choice—confidence that you can put the strike that is coming in play.</p>
<p>I remember, as a young player, sometimes swinging just to strike out rather than face the anxiety and pressure head on; having to produce when that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s required is probably the most challenging aspect of baseball, and the reason why a shade above mediocrity, by some standards, is greatness.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m just a country boy,&#8221; he&#8217;s said countless times.</p>
<p>He was a country boy of 22 years when he was the major casualty of what can only be described as a hellish all-terrain vehicle accident that left him with a dislocated hip and a few broken bones that were never diagnosed, simply because the doctors never thought to check anything but the horrific, obvious injury of a hip and leg stuck at an impossible angle.</p>
<p><em>The Detroit News</em> had a superb story on it last year toward the end of the season; the link is now expired. A detail I&#8217;ll not forget anytime soon: that he had to be driven on bumpy, rural roads—sans painkillers—for hours to the nearest hospital. Imagine that. Shudder.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that playing baseball again—at all—was not even a remote certainty, and sometimes you wonder if Raburn doesn&#8217;t need to be reminded that this opportunity in the Majors is one he&#8217;s earned. Indeed, it&#8217;s one he had to earn more than once, and he owes it to himself—and every moment he dedicated to what had to have been a nightmare of a recovery and rehab—to just take that last step and reach his potential, even if that potential tops out at .280.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Sometimes, he&#8217;s a victim. As Pat Caputo points out, Raburn&#8217;s best position is second base. And, as baseball writer Jon Morosi noted during another sub-par outfield performance last week, it&#8217;s hard to fault Raburn for his left-field letdowns when manager Jim Leyland names him the everyday 2B and then promptly goes a week without playing him at the bag.</p>
<p>Maybe, like a toddler, he needs a few things: a little more discipline (at the plate), a little more love (and confidence), and a set schedule—like starting at second base for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost as if, for a guy like Raburn, the perception creates the reality. When he feels secure, he flourishes—as in <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_06_05_detmlb_chamlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=det" target="_blank">Sunday&#8217;s timely, desperately-needed blast that plated four runs when the Tigers were down</a>.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;d that bit of security come from? Teammate Miguel Cabrera:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His game is like waves,&#8221; Miguel Cabrera said. &#8220;Right now, he&#8217;s worried because he&#8217;s not hitting too much, he&#8217;s not hitting for average. I said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s going to be your time. Get your timing, be ready. It&#8217;s a long season. We&#8217;re going to need you.&#8217; And you see what happened today. He got a big home run for us today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cabrera had been giving encouragement to Raburn in recent days as he saw Raburn continue to press. He had been kidding with him, too, that the second half was just around the corner and that&#8217;s when he gets hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take one day at a time. You don&#8217;t get big numbers in one day. You have to do something every day, play hard every day, and at the end of the season, I think the numbers are going to be there. That&#8217;s why I told him, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry about that.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It started when  Joel Zumaya faced <a target="new" href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/11/bad-news-for-joel-zumaya/">another setback</a>. Which would seem to be just a very Zumaya-esque form of horrible, gut-wrenchingly unfair luck for a kid who just seems so deserving of success&mdash;until I remembered reading <a target="new" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tom_verducci/03/08/stephen.strasburg.mechanics/index.html">this wonderful Sports Illustrated piece about Zoom Zoom&#8217;s mechanics</a>.</p>
<p>What? What? You mean to tell me that in the past 5 years, the Tigers&#8217; pitching staff hasn&#8217;t bothered to address Joel&#8217;s mother-trucking mechanics issues? </p>
<p>What do they do all day, if not work to protect and extend the life of one of their most promising young arms? As a mother&mdash;and we know I feel very maternally for Joel&mdash;I am fucking pissed. Chuck Hernandez, Rick Knapp, why haven&#8217;t you fixed this? The knock on Joel that he&#8217;s just fragile when, REALITY, he&#8217;s prone to injury because his MECHANICS ARE FAULTY&mdash;that&#8217;s your fault, Chuck, and yours too, Rick.</p>
<p>I mean, it&#8217;s your JOB to work on these issues. Now, before you get all whiny with me or explain how hard it is to alter some lifelong mechanics, let me say: bullshit. First, again, it is your job. Second, it is also Zumaya&#8217;s job. Third, what else do you have to do?</p>
<p>Example: I hired a coach. I have thrown sidearm, mechanically poor and physically prone to injury, since I was five. Now, 26 years later, it took less than 25 one-hour sessions to fix.  And I&#8217;m not even getting paid to throw! Now, if my coach&mdash;who is awesome, obviously&mdash;can fix my arm, why can&#8217;t a major league coach fix a relatively simple major league mechanical flaw?</p>
<p>It got me thinking about what appears to be a systemic issue for the Tigers: the coaching isn&#8217;t working, if it is happening at all.</p>
<p>Example: As I learned from watching Ken Burns&#8217; latest installment of <em>Baseball</em>, the reason the Yankees are dominant is because they fucking rock out at situational hitting. That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s not dumb luck that a soft single lands in right field on a full count after three foul balls with a man on third. It&#8217;s the product of months and years of practice.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Twins and Chicago White Sox are also killer when it comes to situational hitting. The Twins work on it in batting practice&mdash;even before road games. The Tigers?</p>
<p>Well, as my friend Brett pointed out this weekend, the Tigers haven&#8217;t gotten any better at situational hitting or even baserunning in the past 5 years. (See: Will Rhymes&#8217; slide that featured him TOUCHING THE CATCHER&#8217;S GLOVE, essentially tagging himself out&mdash;because the umpire mistakenly thought the catcher had the ball in his glove.)</p>
<p>When you take a look at what&#8217;s plagued the Tigers for years now, it becomes obvious where the failure of coaching comes into play.</p>
<p>How do you lose a game 2-0 when Verlander pitches a gem? When you leave men on base, which the Tigers do <em>en masse</em> night after night after night.</p>
<p>Saturday, it was Magglio Ordonez swinging (for the fences) on the first pitch with the bases loaded. Fly ball out, side retired, goodnight. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s something deeply wrong with the approach to hitting taken by the hitting coach when a.) your 7,8,9 hitters fare better than your 1,2 hitters and b.) your hitters never seem to improve at situational hitting or plate patience.</p>
<p>How many times have we heard Jim Leyland, who we all know I absolutely adore, say after the game that we just didn&#8217;t hit the guys around? </p>
<p>What I want to know is what the repercussions are for it?</p>
<p>When I hack at pitches outside the strike zone during batting practice, my coach adds ten pushups to my payment. That&#8217;s right&mdash;I pay him, and he punishes me for getting lazy. What happens to Magglio, Jackson, Rhymes, etc., etc., etc.? What happens when the entire team is swinging for the fences instead of taking the outside pitch opposite field?</p>
<p>Nothing. Which must be true, because we have seen little improvement.  And really, who bothers to change if there are no consequences for staying the same?</p>
<p>People, something has to give. It&#8217;s time, as my friend Kyle mentioned, to give up this idea that only second basemen can hit second in the order. It&#8217;s time to jettison this BS nonsense of &#8220;saving&#8221; your quality relievers for the upcoming series or the later innings when it&#8217;s more important to win NOW, to hold the lead NOW. </p>
<p>(As another pal, Steve, pointed out – it&#8217;s not like the Tigers have lost the AL Central 2 of the last 4 years by one game and these early wins aren&#8217;t important. Oh, wait.)</p>
<p>None of this absolves Leyland.</p>
<p>Leyland has got to stop managing these talented players like they&#8217;re the Miami Heat. We&#8217;ve seen him go ballistic on umpires – I&#8217;d like him to unleash some of that on players who don&#8217;t do the little things it takes – and the big things it takes – to win.</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe we don&#8217;t want a full-fledged Ozzie Guillen type management experience in Detroit, but I don&#8217;t think holding players accountable is over the top. </p>
<p>Including, obviously, their off the field issues. As my friend Shane often lambastes Mark Dantonio for not punishing his troublemaking players, I think it&#8217;s time for Leyland to come down on Cabrera for his off-the-field train wrecks.</p>
<p>This team needs something. It needs a kick in the pants. It needs Jim Leyland to channel Sparky Anderson and bench slackers, send down struggling players and challenge his boys to do more than the bare minimum.</p>
<p>This team needs a coaching staff that isn&#8217;t afraid of the players and isn&#8217;t lacksadasical about DOING THEIR FUCKING JOBS. That means getting Austin Jackson out of bed at 7 am, Lloyd, and hitting off the tee and then with a bullpen catcher pitching some live toss until he fixes his timing. You&#8217;re a hitting coach. This is an easy fix.</p>
<p>That means, Rick Knapp, fixing the mechanics of gunners like Zumaya and working with every pitcher in the rotation and the bullpen to pinpoint what they&#8217;re doing wrong – and fix it.</p>
<p>That means hiring a bench coach who isn&#8217;t going to shrink away from asking Miguel why he was running for home on a bloop single to left. That means getting in the face of Raburn when he airmails it from the outfield.</p>
<p>It means making clear whose asses are on the line, and whose are going to be benched and kicked.</p>
<p>It means no more ass kissing, bitches. I&#8217;m tired of seeing this sparkless, gutless baseball. If I wanted to see this, I&#8217;d play the Lions 0-16 season on repeat. </p>
<p>Do it right, or take your talents to South Beach. We don&#8217;t have time for prima donnas and half-assing it here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong></p>
<p>When I was in sixth grade&mdash;the last year I played Little League fast pitch softball before quitting until high school&mdash;my coach, Mr. Tersigni, would pile us all into the back of his Ford Bronco and take us to Dairy Queen after a win. While the experience of that last season and my volatile coach soured me on my sport for a few summers, Mr. T (who looked quite a bit like an out-of-shape Jose Canseco, plus mullet) imparted something I&#8217;d internalize. </p>
<p>He&#8217;d hit grounders at me until I stopped pulling a leg like an elephant avoiding a mouse, demanded I take the ball off the shin rather than give up the base hit. </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong></p>
<p>That last summer, I remember the lumps of my shins showing through socks and stirrups, the swollen contusions tender even when I stood still. I remember the way they bounced against each other in the back of the Bronco on the way to Dairy Queen, Mr. T turning up the radio and the whole team of 12 year old girls singing along to John (Cougar) Mellencamp: </p>
<blockquote><p>Hurt so good<br />
Come on baby, make it hurt so good<br />
Sometimes love don&#8217;t feel like it should<br />
You make it hurt so good</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p>My coach can&#8217;t get over how much better my hitting is when I swing freely instead of trying to muscle the ball. He doubles over laughing when I overthrow first and tell him I didn&#8217;t feel like I was throwing. &#8220;So you don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re doing something right unless you can feel it?&#8221; </p>
<p>Close. Unless it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong></p>
<p>A brief history of softball-related injuries:</p>
<p>Summer 2002, 75 percent tear of right quad<br />
Summer 2003, concussion and whiplash<br />
Spring 2004, left triceps, hip and outer thigh covered in contusions<br />
Summer 2009, high ankle sprain<br />
Winter 2009/Spring 2010 deep bone contusion (lower ankle), ankle sprain*<br />
Fall 2010/Winter2010/Early Spring 2011assorted bruises </p>
<p>*soccer related</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, it doesn&#8217;t even hurt. <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/11/02/project-3b/">It just bleeds</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, it doesn&#8217;t bleed. Well, it bleeds under the skin.<br />

<p><strong>7.</strong></p>
<p>The narrative here isn&#8217;t lost on me: that a man taught me something I loved would cause me pain, by definition, because it hurts when you do things the right way. You give up the body, you give up the ghost. If love is baseball and baseball hurts, if a=b and b=c, then a=c and love hurts.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much of the project is about unlearning the bad lessons men taught me about baseball, and how much is about unlearning the bad lessons men taught me. </p>
<p><strong>9.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re doing it right, it shouldn&#8217;t hurt. You shouldn&#8217;t even feel it.&#8221; </p>
