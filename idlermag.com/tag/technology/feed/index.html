										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wonder what is like being from another country. This sounds sort of stupid, but Americans often have a strange, warped view of the music of other countries. It is not unexpected to have a country-specific oritentation towards your own pop culture. We are the center of our experience and of our own perspective. In music, we are aware of the music originating in other countries, but it ebbs and flows. In the 90s the pendulum was the alt.rock movement coming from Seattle and other spots. Then the pendulum swung towards the UK with Oasis and Britpop. But what would the 90s have been like in other countries? Just how dominant is the American music scene in other countries? How did the music coming from the USA play in these countries during musical boom times and musical bust times? What happens when the pendulum swings in the opposite direction?</p>
<p>England may not the best example, since the UK has produced so much of our popular music in the past 50 years. Let’s think about other English-speaking countries like Canada and Australia. Have you ever tried to watch the Juno awards on CBC and felt that even without a language barrier that you may as well have been watching a program on how to learn Morse code? A quick trawl through the record books shows an unmatched FIVE YEAR WINNING STREAK FOR BRYAN ADAMS. On the female side, Anne Murray and Celine Dion have four-year streaks. The Tragically Hip, a quintessentially Canadian band, have won multiple Juno awards. </p>
<p>The Aria awards, from Australia, can feel equally as disjointed. The Hall of Fame class of 2011 consisted of Kylie Minogue and the Wiggles. Yes. The Wiggles, torturers of parents for over a decade. Yet a swirl through the award winners does not always yield a wacky result. For in 1998 the Aria Album of the Year was <em>Unit</em> by the Brisbane band, Regurgitator. Never heard of them? Of course not! But I have, and let me tell you, they’re great.</p>
<p>In 1998 I spent some time participating in an overseas study program through Michigan State University. I spent time in Australia, folks, Sydney and Canberra to be more precise. Now you would not know this from looking at me but I LOVE Australia and have for thirty years. (Is that possible? When did I first learn of Australia? Let’s see. . . Superman 2 on HBO, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor wanting beachfront property, globe spins to. . . Australi. New Year&#8217;s Day 1982. Yep, thirty years) Once I got over my initial cowardice and signed up for the program, I departed from Detroit in early January of 1998.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9269" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/23/regurgitated/unit/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Unit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=640" alt="Unit" title="Unit"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-9269" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Once in Australia, I heard bits and bobs about this band from Brisbane. The HMV store I lived at in Sydney had the CD on display, a silver cover with a great yellow circle on the front. Yet I didn’t buy it. When our group arrived in Canberra I remember talking with an Australian girl about the band, “the Gurge” she called them. I was really trying to chat her up when my attention was distracted by a ditz with big brown eyes (look it up) and when I turned around the Aussie was gone. But her words on the band stuck with me. I bought a Rolling Stone with the band on the cover and read up on them before really digging into their catalog. It took my return to the states before I got a chance to buy <em>Unit</em>. Actually, I came into work one day and there was in my locker. I had no idea my manager ordered it for me from the import sheets, and it was such a wonderful shock. I bought the disc and took it home to listen to it.</p>
<p>The disc opens with the song, “I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff.” You need to know the first LP, <em>Tu Plang</em>, to understand that opening song. On their first CD the band is very rockish, muscular and melodic, with lots of crash and <em>sturm und drang</em>. The humor is evident (&#8220;I Sucked A Lot of Cock To Get Where I Am&#8221;) as are the band’s interest in different sounds (&#8220;G7 Dick Electric Boogie&#8221;). Hearing those songs and then this first song, you come to an understanding that the band is branching into a new direction, one that may not be well received. But then on &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; the band is just a ripping motor of super fast, super fun music. Two songs in and <em>Unit</em> is only about 6 minutes long and just tons of fun. Then you get to the third song, called “! (The Song Formerly Known As)&#8221; which is a killer. Sort of like a hybrid Prince song, catchy and rocking and vibrant. In these songs you hear the sounds that were being planted on that first disc and watching them bloom is very exciting. The disc was strong in 1998 and while it isn’t quite as strong in 2012, the tracks that stood out still stand out. &#8220;Bubble Boy&#8221; is the second greatest song about an inflatable sex doll, only trailing Roxy Music’s &#8220;In Every Dream Home A Heartache&#8221; on that sparsely inhabited trail.</p>
<p>The not-yet-extinct music video helped the band with their image and the videos from the <em>Unit</em> LP are as strong as the songs. &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; acts out the plot to <em>Tron</em>, while “!” shows the band standing around in Japanese crowds.  Other videos are computer animated and silly and disposable but somehow entertaining and engaging as well.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9270" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/23/regurgitated/art1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Art1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=640" alt=". . . Art" title="Art1"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-9270" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> There are a few themes that pop up on <em>Unit</em> that make their way into Regurgitator’s follow-up CD, <em>. . . Art</em>, most notably a sense of disconnection from humanity and the embrace of technology as a substitute for traditional human interaction. These themes are sometimes subtle, sometimes not. Even on their poppiest of songs, and man oh man does <em>. . . Art</em> have some poppy songs, there is a bittersweet underpinning to every lyric. On &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; from <em>Unit</em>, Quan Yeomans sings “everyday I talk to my machines/more sense than talking with human beings.” This disconnect, the withdrawal into the virtual doesn’t sound too far-fetched today but in 1998 could it have seemed real? The last song on <em>. . . Art</em> is titled &#8220;Virtual Life&#8221; and the words are about needing everything from the TV screen and needing nothing else from a regular life. As a man who spends too much time on Facebook, this song feels prophetic. We surrender so much of ourselves to exist online.</p>
<p>When I was in Australia I noticed a sign in the classrooms on my second day in the country: a sign beckoning students to turn off their cell phones. Back home, cell phones were car phones and were the size of a foot. They weren’t everywhere and they certainly weren’t “your phone.” In some ways it feels strange that one of the most removed continents, hell, THE most removed continent on the globe would be so quick to adapt to new technology. At the same time, with that early adaption, perhaps that is where the burnout so aptly described on these songs originates. In the late 90s there was so much of an undercurrent of chatter speaking to “pre-millennium tension” but without any substance or understanding of where that tension originated from. Here, in Australia, was a band that was singing out about a different type of tension between technology and human connection, which has grown and overgrown the globe in the 14 years since the words were put to tape.</p>
<p>When I listen to <em>Unit</em> and <em>. . . Art</em>, I am magically whisked away from here to another land and another time. As with any nostalgia, some of the memories hold up, some don’t. The tracks on these two LPs, however, hold up in all their poppy greatness. I see that the band continues to record and release music. I’m glad for that as we are all better off with a band like Regurgitator in the world. Humor, discontent, observation and melody. What more do you need?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To be perfectly honest, hockey has not been at the top of the brain for the last month. I moved from San Francisco to Philadelphia over the weekend and the cross-country switch has been preoccupying, to put it mildly. Maybe that&#8217;s part of the reason why I got home (my parents&#8217; home &#8212; still apartment hunting) from my first day at a new job, sunk onto the couch in what my dad affectionately calls &#8220;The Doghouse,&#8221; and was completely dumbfounded to realize that I kind of forgot what it is like to watch hockey on TV.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty fantastic, in case you were wondering.</p>

Other than that, it seems that for the last month my entire hockey universe existed on Twitter. But on Tuesday, as I watched the Flyers tie the Islanders in regulation, keep it scoreless in overtime, then lose in a shoot out (<a href="http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2011020787" target="_blank">Ilya Bryzgalov just cannot do shoot outs</a>) it dawned on me that really my entire hockey experience over the last two and a half years has existed, predominantly, on Twitter.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>One reason is definitely the time difference. It&#8217;s probably fair to say that the majority of the NHL season does not take place in Pacific Standard Time. For me, that meant most games I care about took place while I was still at work on weekdays or just getting my day going on weekends.</p>
<p>And, as I&#8217;ve mentioned already, San Francisco is not the most vibrant hockey city. Part of this cultural failure may have something to do with the fact that hockey coincides with some of the best weather in the Bay Area. If hockey was a summer sport I bet San Franciscans would gladly spend an afternoon cheering on the San Jose Sharks to escape the fog monster. But in the fall and most of the winter and spring it&#8217;s clear and crisp and oh-so-sunny. Who wants to sit inside a dark apartment and watch an ice hockey game during some of the sunniest hours of the year?</p>
<p>I guess DVR might have solved my particular problem, but I&#8217;m being candid when I say the chances of me watching a recorded, regular season game that happened five to ten hours ago are close to nil.</p>
<p>So why Twitter?</p>
<p>To start, Twitter seems to have changed the way fans relate to both athletes and reporters. I&#8217;d like to write more about this strange dynamic some other time, but suffice it to say that Twitter offers a whole new dimension in which to relate to a player on what feels like a more insider-y (if you&#8217;ll allow me make up a word) level.</p>
<p>Not to pick on Bryzgalov (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bryzgoalie30" target="_blank">@bryzgoalie30</a>), but the oddball Russian Flyers&#8217; goalie already has a short, but colorful record of insane tweets that confirms three things for a fan like me</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> He wasn&#8217;t acting out of the ordinary on HBO&#8217;s 24/7 series when he achieved national fame for expounding on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipORwP1ICXc" target="_blank">the hugeness of space</a><br />
<strong>2.</strong> Goalies are out of their minds<br />
<strong>3.</strong> He likes sturgeon.</p>
<p>Like celebrities, not all athletes tweet interesting commentary. Some of them are downright lame. But those players that are particularly clever, creative, or even incendiary are that much more compelling.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the pre-game and post-game analysis from sports reporters on Twitter. Having all of that in one place means I can skim as much of the aggregated mess of content as I want while barely looking up from whatever else I am diligently (I swear) working on.</p>
<p>In the beginning of my Bay Area tenure, it was a slick and slippery slope from TV, to Ice Tracker, to Twitter. What eventually transformed me into an addicted Twitter hockey fan, though, was the ability to follow the record of the entire game as it happened and still get work done. At 4 pm PST on a weekday, when the Flyers were likely as not taking the ice, Twitter allowed me to commit that most cliched of sins: killing two birds with one stone. That has been the ultimate key.</p>
<p>But now that I&#8217;m back on the east coast, and (for a limited time) back at home, I&#8217;m sort of surprised at what I&#8217;ve missed. My Twitter hockey days aren&#8217;t over &#8212; note the comment about addiction. But despite nearly three years of experience harnessing social media to keep track of the NHL, I am relearning that in the end the only multitasking I really need to do during a hockey game includes drinking a beer and yelling at the good old TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doing Two Things Is Confusing</strong><br />
The year is 2000, Amazon, the burgoning internet book seller, splits off their new music department into a website called Nile.com. By 2011 every river has a .com address and is a commerce portal operated by Amazon.com. Over the next 10 years the internet is entirely dominated by single-serving sites. Subdomains don’t exist and more than 8 characters after the .com is considered obscene. As Netflix’s streaming catalog threatens to overshadow its classic DVD by mail program a bewildered public and confused stock market force Netflix to spin off its flagship productline into a new company for clarity’s sake. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Sadists</strong><br />
Fuck you for using our service. No seriously, fuck you. Oh you were just about to finish that streaming movie? <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/08/does-netflix-give-enough-warning-when-streaming-titles-expire.html" target="_blank">NOPE.</a> Expired.

<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Masochists</strong><br />
What do you mean you like my variety? I hate that about myself. The future isn’t in discs and my present streaming selection sucks. My core business model is a joke. Spank me on the stock market, abuse me in my comment threads. I deserve it. I don’t know why you keep giving me money anyways. I know everyone is mocking me when they call things “the Netflix of whatever”.  I know they just mean the new failure. I’m going to go cut myself. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix Is Having An Identity Crisis</strong><br />
I’m chopping off my hair, kicking out my core business, and uprooting myself to a different domain. You can call me Starchild Qwikster.  Netflix is my slave name. </p>

<p><strong>Netflix: White Collar Squatter</strong><br />
Unhappy with their business model, Netflix decided to follow Google’s. They choose an impossible to remember company name then buy every spelling permutation to show ads against. </p>
<p><strong>Qwikster: Pawn in Corporate Chess</strong><br />
Netflix puts Qwikster up for sale. Amazon buys Qwikster. Netflix buys Hulu. Apple files anti-duopoly lawsuit.  Amazon merges with Netflix, hostilely takes over Apple. Government breaks up iFlixzon. Qwikster only viable model after internet razing war. </p>
<p><strong>An Offer Netflix Can&#8217;t Refuse</strong><br />
In exchange for rights to stream high quality movies, the studios extracted extraordinary measures from Netflix. </p>
<ol>
<li>Reed Hastings&#8217;s must visit each of the studio heads personally and sing &#8220;I am a little teapot.&#8221;</li>
<li>The studios kidnapped Reed Hastings&#8217;s daughter and if he didn&#8217;t comply they&#8217;d sign her to a three picture deal with Eddie Murphy. </li>
<li>In a fit of Scrabble-induced pique, the studios demanded that Netflix must spin off its DVD by mail service into a new website that uses a Q, W, and K, but only two vowels. </li>
<li>The new site cannot use any of Netflix&#8217;s APIs and must be coded by out-of-work humanities PhDs given an <em>HTML For Dummies</em> book. </li>
<li>Netflix is not allowed to blame or even mention the studios as its rationale for these changes. </li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Old timey 3D" src="https://i1.wp.com/singularityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/3d_movie.jpeg" alt="" width="240" height="170" />Saying that Hollywood is rarely original is an understatement, but nothing has driven that point home more than the recent market saturation of 3D. While James Cameron’s <em>Avatar</em> did not secure him another Best Picture Oscar, it did launch a new wave of band-wagon jumping that is not currently showing signs of slowing.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, 3D films have been around for over a century, and the popularity of the format seems to come and go in waves. <em>Avatar</em>&#8216;s successful use of the technology led to 25 films being released in 3D in 2010 alone. That’s more than the previous five years <strong>combined. </strong>At least 40 films are expected to come out this year in 3D, including at least one porno (yuck), and more than a dozen films are currently scheduled for 2012.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies like Panasonic have begun marketing 3D Cameras to “prosumers” and nearly every TV and game maker is rabidly trying to release their latest device with 3D tech. While there is almost certainly potential in gaming, I think most people who drop six grand a 3D TV are going to be kicking themselves in a year or two.  There will always be technophiles who have to have the latest thing on the market, and 3D TV seem like a way to milk more money out of these people as TVs have reached their maximum practical sizes and 2K/4K remains years away from being consumer-friendly.</p>
<p>But as far as the movies themselves are concerned, I have a few issues with this new craze and it all starts at the theaters. While I still enjoy a good 3D movie, the problem is finding one. Major studios seem to be competing to see who can come up with the most gratuitous and absurd use of 3D to sell overpriced tickets to otherwise insignificant films. My vote currently goes to Touchstone for unleashing <em>Step Up 3</em>D upon the world. Then there are the movies that could be good on their own but, in an effort to join the trend, are converted to 3D in post-production. I have yet to see a film that was originally flat and then converted that made any decent use of 3D.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="New 3D" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.3dmovie.com/3dmovies.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="225" />The real problem seems to be this prevalent idea that movies <em>have</em> to be in 3D now or they risk being considered outdated. This is complete bullshit of course. Good movies don’t need to pop off the screen to be enjoyable, but bad ones need it to be marketable. So as long as 3D remains the latest trend in Hollywood, we moviegoers will likely be forced to pay more to see good movies that don’t require gimmicks and bad ones that use them as a crutch.</p>
<p>I don’t expect 3D to go away anytime soon, but I expect in a few years it will once again be mostly relegated to children’s movies and documentaries shown only at science center IMAX theaters.   In the meantime, if nothing else, the format has the benefit of highlighting many of the bad movies that are going to be put out in the next few years. I would suggest avoiding movies that have 3D in the title. The good ones don’t need it.</p>

Apple computers, that is. Nothing against the fruit the computers are named for, but I do tend to prefer oranges. I remember growing up with strange, variant PCs but the computers in our home that really stood out were the Apple products. To this day my Dad still has one of the old school tower models in black and white as well as a Color Classic. As a technology buff with disposable income my father has always been an early adopter and when he buys something new I tend to get the “old” things. Dad has always used both PCs and Apples and he has always moved towards embracing the new. Matter of fact he was a bit ahead of his time, perhaps, as the only person I have ever met that owned a Newton! My own first computer was a Mac Quadra, one of the “pizza box” Macs of the early/mid-90s. When I graduated from MSU in 1999 I got a G3 tower. At some point I ended up with a G4 tower; when I moved up north this was the computer I brought with me. This gave way to an old iMac G5 from my parent’s basement and when that went kaput I got the iMac that I’m typing this screed on. My first laptop was an old Powerbook with a 512MB hard drive. In 2001 I got a Powerbook G4 laptop that remains my favorite laptop all time in terms of what it could do, how it typed, how it felt and how it worked. As it died it was supplanted by a 17” G4 laptop. This most recent laptop is in desperate need of replacement as the hard drive is messed up and the battery only holds a charge for 18 minutes. Why is this relevant to this column, one that is about music? </p>

In 2001, when I got the new laptop it came with a pre-installed program that was relatively new called iTunes. The laptop found its way into my hands in early 2001. iTunes was released as a program in January 2001. That fall the first iPod was released. Chalk white with a blue LCD screen and click wheel, the first iPod was something different. Anyone could have a huge portable music library available to carry around. Napster had just been shut down as an avenue to find music online and lots of people were still discovering just how much music could be carried around at one time. I guess at the time, in 2001, things just were different. It took two years for the iTunes Store to open, eventually hanging its shingle in 2003.  Nobody reading this site is unaware of the iTunes store. It took Apple 1033 days to sell one billion (yes, billion) songs online. It took 1359 more days to bring that sales total to ten billion. Think about this one. It took Apple 2.8 years to sell 1,000,000,000 songs. It took them only 3.7 more years to increase that number by a factor of ten. </p>

I own seven iPods. I have my own original iPod as well as my sister’s first generation iPod. In 2004 for Christmas I was given the first edition U2 iPod and in 2006 I was given a Video iPod. Somewhere in here I got a first generation green iPod Mini. In late 2006 I purchased one of the new, matchbook-sized iPod Shuffles and in 2009 I got my iPod Touch. Honestly I use the last two more than the first five combined. I love my shuffle. I got it when my wife was pregnant with our son and I carry it everywhere and use it for working out and for running. The iPod Touch is one of my favorite things I carry in my pockets. I was slightly giddy twice in the past three months as I thought I would be needing to replace it with a newer, camera-enabled model due to losing the player and then dropping it in the snow. In the case of the former I finally really looked and located the player deep in a chair in my son’s room while in the case of the latter I placed the snow shocked iPod on top of an external hard drive. Two days later it worked.  </p>
<p>Why am I writing about this? I’m writing about this because for Christmas 2010 my wife was given her very first iPod, one of the new über-small iPod Shuffles. (Full disclosure: My Moms bought her the iPod. I spend all my money on food, gasoline, and Lipton tea.) She had been using mine while at the gym and grew to love the size and ease of the device.  Along with the device she received a $50 gift card. This is there the magic happened, if you will. </p>
<p>Before I move forward with this story I need to give a bit of background. Like many music lovers, I have slightly addictive tendencies. My addictions have been pretty white bread and above ground: CDs, LPs, 8-Tracks at one point, drinking tea. I moved from collecting comics to collecting baseball cards before turning towards music. I do remember the moment that I realized that I was done with baseball cards in the early 90s: I was at Lefty’s in Okemos (now long gone) buying a box of baseball or possibly hockey cards. A box. This kid came in and bought one pack, sat down at the table in front of the window, and proceeded to open the pack. The joy on his face for each card made me feel shallow and hollow. I wasn’t getting any joy out of my box of cards and this kid was getting so much out of each individual card. I sold music for 11 years. I bought a LOT of music, I sold a LOT of my own music, and I got TONS and TONS of free music.  There has never been a moment with music that matches the emotional punch I felt that afternoon. Honestly there is only one time with music that came close.  That moment was once I set up my wife’s iTunes account and watched as she began shopping for and buying music.</p>
<p>In Suttons Bay, a town about 18 miles north of Traverse City, there is a candy store, an honest-to-God candy store. I have taken both my children to this store. I am well familiar with the idiom, “like a kid in a candy store.” It&#8217;s a tired idiom, but it was true watching my wife surf and shop. Pure glee, just pure glee. I hadn’t thought about it at the time, but it was her FIRST time noodling around the store, finding music and thinking about where to go next. I tried to give her some gentle tips towards finding original tracks rather than remakes and then let her loose. I think she still has money left on the card and is taking her time to use it. Which is great. I will be hard pressed to find an instance like the one I found when she began searching through the songs. I do not remember her exact words more than saying, “This is great! I should have done this years ago!”</p>
<p>I wonder if nowadays, with everything so at the fingertips of anyone, if the ability to relax and discover is still possible. The story of the boy with the baseball cards feels so much truer now, 17 years after the fact. Can something simple and user-directed produce feelings of joy and good cheer in a world where all you have to do is type and click to find well over 100,000 pages you could look at? What happens to the youth of today who grow up in a clickable, searchable world where anything is accessible? What happens in 17 years when these children are grown up, what will they be nostalgic for?</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4036" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/26/discovery/itunes-logo/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/itunes-logo.png" data-orig-size="256,256" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="itunes-logo" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/itunes-logo.png?w=256" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/itunes-logo.png?w=256" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/itunes-logo.png?w=640" alt="iTunes" title="itunes-logo"   class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4036" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/itunes-logo.png 256w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/itunes-logo.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px" /> For the longest time in the dying days of my record stores we would wonder about what would come next. What would be the next big thing that would revolutionize or redefine the music industry. Twenty years ago it was Nirvana, brining in waves of what they called “grunge.” Ten years ago, or more like 12 years ago, there was the big boy band surge that brought floods of synthetic prepackaged music to pre-teens. What would come next? What would be the big band that would bring things back to the mainstream? All that time thinking about what was around the corner made me blind to what was right in front of my face: iTunes. It wasn’t the music that was changed in the last big push; it was the means by which the music was delivered. Will I miss the next big thing? Will there even be one?</p>
