										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Hitler! What would you have thought about how much literary and artistic inspiration your heinous political persona has given the world over the last seventy-odd years? </p>
<p>It’s an interesting conundrum to think about how much influence the actions of this failed art student (enveloped in the form of a mad dictator) have had on the world of imagination. On one hand, it should be no surprise that, so long as the Holocaust survivor narrative continues &#8212; by first hand account or recorded for future generations &#8212; we wrestle with the atrocity that was the systematic genocide of millions of Jews, homosexuals, Romani and people with disabilities, among others. Nazism remains a deep, unhealed scar on the Western world, perhaps always to be so, that practically begs interaction with the artistic mind. We write, draw, film, and craft to work out our demons and attempt to unravel reality toward a full understanding of its meaning. I spent two years in college studying with one of the foremost American minds on the philosophical reach of the Holocaust* and my mind still remains overwhelmed by its consequences. Some spend their entire careers as such.</p>
<p>Comic books, because of their development and growth in the era surrounding World War II, have an inextricable connection to the Nazi threat. Captain America and many more heroes of the Golden Age owe their origins in one form or another to these events. War comics, such as <em>Sgt. Rock</em> and <em>G.I. Combat</em>, spanned decades of publication, depicting the fight against Hitler’s rise month in and month out for readers on the edge of their seats. Time has marched on, of course, as the marketplace finds less viability for the war comic genre. Even the Justice Society of America has replaced Nazism in its core narrative with an inter-dimensional threat in order to maintain the credibility of its members’ ages &#8212; if not just because the battles of World War II now feel distant to a younger readership. Yet, despite all this, Hitler and his directives still pervade the public consciousness, perhaps more sharply than ever before.</p>
<p>But where does a struggle to understand bleed over into monumentalizing a single man? From Quentin Tarantino’s film <em>Inglouious Basterds</em>, a stylized Jewish revenge fantasy about hunting down Nazis and killing Hitler, to Maurizio Cattelan’s photorealistic sculpture of <em>Hitler Kneeling</em> as a supplicant child, artists continue to engage not just with the historical context, but with the man himself. We continue to go back to the well with Adolf, ever transforming him into a character as commodified as Mickey Mouse or Superman &#8212; an irony that should not be lost on students of history. Indeed he is foremost depicted today as either an inept laughingstock (think <a href="http://youtu.be/d_RXwrYa4sk" target="_blank">Hitler’s Reaction to <em>Halo 4</em></a>) or a surmountable foe, but he remains a singular part of the cultural zeitgeist decades later. His personal presence is enshrined not simply in history, but truly in posterity.</p>
<p>As if to hit that particular nail on the head, arrived <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em>, the 2007 graphic novel by Norwegian writer/artist Jason, distributed in the United States by Fantagraphics Books. A uniquely touching, yet amusing, tale of melancholic love and obligation, <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em> is set in a world where murder-for-hire is a legal profession. The main character is approached by a scientist to take on a very challenging assignment &#8212; the murder of Adolf Hitler. It seems the scientist has developed a time machine, which only now, after fifty years, is fully charged and ready for a round trip expedition to 1938 Germany. The killer simply must step inside and push a single button, and emerge to shoot Hitler before repeating the trip back home. Simple enough.</p>

<p>Of course, as little time travel ever goes precisely as planned, the killer is overwhelmed by Hitler’s guard and replaced in the time capsule by the Fuhrer himself. Now arriving in the present day, Hitler is met by the killer again, seventy years older &#8212; not nearly as spry as in his professional heyday. The end result is a vanished dictator, a disappointed client, and a man out of time, returned to the life he once knew a much older and exhausted figure.</p>

<p>Like <em>Maus</em> long before it, there’s a psychology to depicting tough emotional content with anthropomorphized subjects. In this case, it’s not atrocity or inhumanity that needs exaggeration as much as a certain melancholia and seriousness that requires undermining. In a world where Hitler roams free and assassination is a viable profession not unlike medicine or the law, to experience human disappointment and anxiety through a collection of dogs, rabbits and birds alleviates a bit of narrative weight. That is to say, there’s a built-in affection that comes with a canine killer and his erstwhile girlfriend that permeates every panel. Jason’s art is simultaneously adorable and moody, with autumnal colors throughout reflecting back the aged nature of a protagonist who had to time travel back home the hard way &#8212; one day at a time. Wrinkles upon the brow and eyes of a dog, one must admit, are far more endearing than on any human being.</p>
<p>The sense of silence throughout the graphic novel reflects back on the idea of distance as well &#8212; distance traveled through time and the emotional distance between the killer and his former girlfriend. For this isn’t science fiction, nor is it historical narrative. <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em> is a love story between two people who may not particularly like each other, but grow to a fondness that may simulate need. Jason doesn’t use captions or thought bubbles, and his dialogue &#8212; sometimes witty, sometimes simply functional &#8212; takes second place to the advanced sense of body language and posture he infuses in each character. Figures slouch, remain barefoot and vulnerable to the world, and find themselves staring blankly toward doorways or across streets. Never quite where they anticipated ending up, all the characters seem listless, but not fully resigned. Momentum may be ever so slow, but it still exists in this inverted existence, much like the experience of late life aging itself.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Fuhrer is no more than a MacGuffin for the plot of <em>I Killed Adolf Hitler</em>, a reason to separate the killer from the life he knew and return him in a different emotional state. His place in this heartfelt narrative is merely utilitarian, one of the most frightening men of the twentieth century reduced to a caricature running off panel. And yet, maybe that’s the true irony of Hitler’s own creative ambition and ruthless attempts at posterity. For such a horror to be summarized in a cartoonish footnote, perhaps power truly has shifted out of the hands of evil into the imagination of a world thriving in his absence. I may never be fully resigned to seeing old Adolf jumping across my screen or page with impunity, but I can certainly join the wrinkled canine protagonist in raising a glass to his demise. “Fuck you, Adolf Hitler” indeed.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>* Want to experience that mind firsthand? Look up <em>Vessels of Evil: American Slavery and the Holocaust</em> by my mentor and brilliant sophisticate Laurence Mordekhai Thomas. It’s challenging, but you won’t be sorry.</p>

Since I watched <em>Inception</em>, probably. Dreaming for me is only ever the illegitimate child of stress and careless imbibing, as a result dreams are closer to nightmares in which I must fix ALL of the things and save the mermaid village from the meteor. But this morning I found myself somewhere between waking life and an R.E.M. cycle as I read Anders Nilsen’s <em>Dogs &amp; Water</em>. I was originally drawn to this book because I really like the name Anders. I suppose I was also snared by the cover, which depicts a guy kneeling on barren ground, wearing a backpack with a teddy bear strapped to it, being presented with a rifle by a member of the dog pack he runs with.</p>
<p>The book’s inner landscape is stark and panel-less. It is, in fact, just as magical as I would expect anything by an Anders to be. Containing only the sparest amounts of text, much of it is illegible scribble. The illustrations flow into one another with no dividing border, creating a fluidity that only heightens the dreamlike state of reading.</p>

His only companions are the stuffed bear strapped to his bag, whose wisdom he defers to in all matters, and later, a pack of wild dogs. The nameless man’s journey is a severe mix of loneliness and traumatic encounters. A chance encounter with a buck, who attempts to steal his bear, dissolves into a fist fight. A feral dog pack keeps him from freezing to death before they come across and devour a human corpse. I once read somewhere that the common house cat will begin eating its owner before the body grows cold. I came across this fact years ago, and it is still one of the most haunting things I believe to be true.</p>
<p>The journey is interspersed with further dream-like digressions comprised of scenes of a boat journey  gone awry. Eventually ending in a shipwreck, which leaves the bear dismembered and the man likely drowned, they encounter a man swimming  to Asia.  Every event in <em>Dogs &amp; Water</em> happens out of time and space, and while everything that happens is possible (except maybe the deer fight),  nothing is likely.</p>

And on the way that wandering with no plan can be just as constrictive and monotonous as following the roadmap.</p>
<p>Nilsen is the author of several books including <em>Don’t Go Where I Can’t Follow</em> and <em>Monologues for the Coming Plague</em>. His work has appeared in <em>The Best American Comics</em> and <em>The Best American Non-Required Reading</em> anthologies, as well as <em>The Believer</em>, <em>The Chicago Reader</em> and elsewhere. For a brief period, Nilsen attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before withdrawing to do comics full time. His <a href="http://themonologuist.blogspot.com/" target="new">blog</a> showcases occasional new material. His <a href="http://www.andersbrekhusnilsen.com/" target="new">website</a> showcases some of his other work including several cover illustrations, like <a href="http://andersbrekhusnilsen.com/images/illustration_images/hca_fairy_tales.jpg" target="new">this excellent piece</a> done for the edition of <em>Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tales</em> published by Penguin in 2006.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/grief-made-graphic/Content?oid=925842" target="new">a rather melancholy piece</a>, the Chicago reader describes Nilsen’s work as “hallucinatory style of fable in which animals and young men ruminate about their existential crises.” I couldn’t agree more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My original plan for this evening was to shower and then spend three hours pondering the truth of how we never know what we’ve got ‘til it’s gone. But since my hot water has yet to return since running off with its druggie boyfriend my night is suddenly free for reading and reflection. Lucky you.</p>
<p>I recently read a graphic novel about another gal who ran away with her druggie boyfriend, and the fact that it ended well leaves me feeling hopeful. <em>Ivy</em> is <a href="http://saraholeksyk.com/" target="new">Sarah Olesyk</a>’s first full-length graphic novel chock-full of angst, cemeteries, and bad decisions. Published by Oni Press in January of this year, <em>Ivy</em>, was originally a five-part series, recently completed, collected and bound. Oleksyk’s style is beautiful and arresting, yet simple. The shading and detail in these black-and-white panels lend the drawings an amazing warmth and depth.</p>

<p><em>Ivy</em> follows its seventeen-year-old namesake as she navigates the trenches of <a href="http://saraholeksyk.com/ivy02.html" target="new">art</a> and algebra, friendships and falling-outs, love and disillusion, and the college application process. Ivy struggles to keep her explosive temper in check, which is easily ignited by crotchety teachers, her absent yet feels-her-opinion-is-law mother, and all manner of life’s minor tragedies.</p>

While on a school trip to Boston (from Maine) to explore art schools, Ivy meets a young criminal (as all young men are, to quote my stepfather) named Josh. They become infatuated instantly, more or less promising having each other at hello and promising to exchange letters.</p>
<p>While Josh’s letters are immediately disturbing (you get me, we belong together, blah blah), Ivy, in the way of all lovesick young women, eats. it. up. This book is a good reminder that the people we like quickly are often not as amazing as we imagine them to be. When Ivy flees her home in Maine after an altercation with her mother, she and Josh join forces and hit the road. The beginning plays out like every young fantasy I ever had running away for love, needing no one and living off the land. Which is really only practical if you’re Pocahontas. (I’m not.)</p>
<p><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="4664" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/31/angst-a-love-story/large_scan0004/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg" data-orig-size="453,609" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="large_scan0004" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg?w=223" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg?w=453" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4664" title="large_scan0004" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg?w=223&#038;h=300" alt="on the couch" width="223" height="300" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg?w=223&amp;h=300 223w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg?w=446&amp;h=600 446w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/large_scan0004.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px" /></a> Even at its most cheesy and angst-saturated, this novel rings true. Ivy’s a modern-day heroine, headstrong if a little directionless. Oleksyk does an excellent job of capturing the complete stupidity and recklessness of teenage love. Even as Ivy berates everyone in her path, punches lockers, alienates her friends, buys drugs, and gets suspended, I found myself pulling for her happiness.</p>
<p>Oleksyk&#8217;s secret weapon in these pages is place. Ivy repeatedly visits an old overpass in the local cemetery, which becomes a character in its own way. Ivy repeatedly retreats to the overpass to seek solace, savor triumph and lick her wounds. I also really enjoyed seeing Ivy’s art on Oleksyk’s pages a mingling of stark portraits and crude caricatures.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, most teenagers are obnoxious jerks. I definitely was and Ivy is too. And that’s what I I love about her.</p>
<p>While perhaps not about to be lauded as a groundbreaking original tale, <em>Ivy</em> hints at the promise of what’s to come from the extremely talented Oleksyk. It’s definitely worth a read, even if only to cite later as you pretentiously inform others that you read her “early work” before she was “mainstream.” There’s no serious-reader buzzkill worse than liking an artist whose work is widely enjoyed. So get in early while the getting’s obscure.</p>

I stumbled across the <em>NYT</em> posts of Israeli comic artist and former editor of the Hebrew edition of <em>MAD Magazine</em> Rutu Modan more than a year ago and was completely enamored with her short graphic essays. Then this week I read Modan’s first full-length graphic novel, <em>Exit Wounds</em>. </p>
<p>The story, though interesting and well-crafted, seemed both too long to capture the intensity of the story it needed to tell, and yet too short to reach the conclusion it grasps at. Events in the plot happen too quickly, before the characters are developed enough to warrant investment. The urgency of events dissipates as the scenes are drawn out but not always filled in. The tragedy and excitement are dulled. The moment to draw the reader in suddenly and completely is fleeting, and too often it passes.</p>
<p><em>Exit Wounds</em> is the story of a Israeli man, Koby, and his interactions with his estranged father’s much younger lover, Numi. Numi tracks Koby down when his father Gabriel’s continued disappearance in the wake of several suicide bombings has her fearing the worst. At the time of Gabriel’s disappearance from Numi’s life, Koby hasn’t spoken to or seen his father in several years. </p>
<p>Numi convinces Koby to help her investigate a recent bombing in which the body of one of the victims was burned beyond recognition. Numi, convinced the unidentified victim is Gabriel because she recognized a scarf she knit him among the television footage of the wreckage, doesn’t even consider alternate explanations for his disappearance. Numi has a likable hard-edged innocence. The purity of her devotion to Gabriel is naïve and endearing&mdash;she’s at that precarious moment before love has let her down and believes with complete conviction that the only thing that would keep her lover from calling her is an unforeseen tragedy.</p>
<p>Modan’s tale captures the small traumas of the everyday in the framework of a larger trauma. Modan perfectly illustrates a country in which suicide bombings happen in such quick and frequent succession that a woman must repeatedly clarify which bombing she suspects took her lover.</p>
<p>The title is of course fitting both literally and in reference to the exit wounds we suffer from when people take their leave from our lives. Nothing ever heals completely, least of all the emotional trauma of abandonment. If this sounds depressing, that’s because it really kind of is. </p>
<p>Modan’s characters are equally expressive and imperfect in both <em>Exit Wounds</em> and her visual blog, Mixed Emotions. This series of six brief memoirs showcase Modan and her family, especially her paternal grandmother who fled to Israel from Warsaw during the German occupation. Her characters are slightly lumpy and blemished, the antithesis of the polished diamond-eyed shine of Manga. My favorite post by Modan is <a target="new" href="http://modan.blogs.nytimes.com/page/2/">“Queen of the Scottish Fairies”</a>. The post chronicles Modan and her husband’s amusing struggle amongst themselves over their son’s love of tutus, dolls, and all things pink. </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="4219" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/03/03/everyday-grotesque/hair/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hair.jpg" data-orig-size="450,466" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hair" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hair.jpg?w=290" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hair.jpg?w=450" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hair.jpg?w=289&#038;h=300" alt="hair" title="hair" width="289" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4219" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hair.jpg?w=289&amp;h=300 289w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hair.jpg?w=145&amp;h=150 145w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/hair.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /> The posts on Mixed Emotions examine glimpses of the every day. A trip to the hairdresser for Rutu and her grandmother provides the platform for her to examine the basis of their strained relationship.  These graphic essays are short and poignant, just long enough to avoid gimmick and make an impact. The short form suits Modan’s story-telling style in a way that her book-length work didn’t quite accomplish. </p>
<p>In her <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzScsEEbDvk">Pretty Cool People Interview</a>, Modan talks about the funny story about cancer she convinced the NYT Magazine they wanted her to write. The story she mentions is <a target="new" href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/magazine/funnypagesModan.html">&#8220;The Murder of the Terminal Patient,&#8221;</a> a seventeen chapter series that encompasses the death of a singer under mysterious circumstances and the ensuing investigation. But don’t go quoting me on that, friends, my information may or may not be from Wikipedia. I plan on reading &#8220;The Murder of the Terminal Patient&#8221; tonight after I Skype with my family while they eat Chinese food for my mom’s birthday (don’t let anyone tell you we don’t know how to have a good time). </p>
<p>As a bonus, <a target="new" href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/artStudio.php?artist=a44be5c884adce">Modan’s website</a> hosted by <em>Drawn and Quarterly</em> looks a lot like something <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/10/on-coming-up-short-in-a-giants-world/">Adrian Tomine</a> might draw!</p>

Rating: Awesome.</p>
<p>When Scott Pilgrim and his precious little life migrated to our purple-mountained land from our neighbor to the north, I slept right through it. I was determined to make up for my lack of fandom once the movie gossip took flight. Michael Cera, you say? Mae Whitman of mayonegg fame? Her? What, is she funny or something?  I read the books. I stalked the IMDB site. I developed a serious crush on half-ninja Roxy Richter. I did everything EXCEPT see the film when it hit theaters in August. Admittedly, it was a busy month for me, what with moving across the country and all. But still, I probably had two free hours in there somewhere. </p>
<p>The series consist of six books created by Canadian artist Bryan Lee O’Malley (who has since migrated south to these United States). The books follow Scott, who divides his time between doing nothing and playing music with his band Sex Bob-omb. Scott falls for recent Toronto transplant, Ramona Flowers (she’s American!). Ramona delivers packages on roller blades, has bad ass hair, and a slew of evil exes. [Note: evil exes, not evil ex-boyfriends, Scott.] The books spawned the film, and also, appropriately, a video game. </p>
<p>My love of the Scott Pilgrim series and film surprised me for a few reasons: One. Scott is not particularly likable. My roommate and I talked about it, so I know it’s not just me hating on the dude. He’s clueless and kind of a screw up. It’s endearing if you have a soft spot for disappointment, and like to be the one who pays for everything. Every. Time. Two. I’ve never been smitten with action-adventure comics. Hold on to your tomatoes and stones, people, I am working on broadening my horizons. Three. I never thought I could enjoy a book riffing on the video game format. Much like porn, you’re not playing <em>Call of Duty</em> for the story. </p>
<p>Though Scott Pilgrim definitely has powers, wins battles, and defeats villains, I am hesitant to group this book with superhero comics. For one, Scott isn’t protecting a city or group of people at large from general evil. He’s battling his girlfriend’s guild of evil exes so he can continue dating her. I found his general lack of greater purpose and priorities comforting. Scott didn’t make me feel like I needed to be a better person; he showed me all of the ways in which I do not need to improve at all. I watch <em>Teen Mom</em> for the same reason. Sometimes you need to see how messy your life could actually be and just relax. </p>

However, by now even I must admit that he pretty much only plays one character. Think about it. <em>Juno</em>: lovesick, loveable, and clueless. <em>Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist</em>: lovesick, loveable, and clueless. I haven’t seen <em>Paper Heart</em> yet, but I’m going to go out on a limb here and guess lovesick, adorbs, and clueless. I like to think of it as &#8220;Adam Sandler Syndrome&#8221; or ASS. It’s not that I don’t like the characters he plays, it’s that I’m pretty sure he’s not playing a character at all. George Michael might be all grown up in the upcoming Arrested Development movie but he’s probably still clueless and in love with his cousin.</p>
<p>Here are some things I love about the <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> books and movie (spoiler alert: it’s NOT Ramona Flowers):</p>
<ol>
<li>Kim Pine’s sass (“Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it. I would punch your life in the face.”)</li>
<li>The very idea of a half ninja.</li>
<li>Everything about Scott’s gay roommate <a target="new" href="http://radiomaru.com/2010/10/30/happy-halloween/">Wallace Wells</a> (Need I say more?)</li>
<li>Knives Chau’s puns. (Yelled during an attack on Ramona: “Get ready to Chau down!”)</li>
<li>Ramona’s goggles and mode of transport. (In no way does this signify a love for Ramona—that girl is selfish.)</li>
</ol>
<p>For most people I know, life is planned for the first 20-something years: school, school, and more school. And then one day you wake up and college is over, the job offers aren’t rolling in, and you’re getting out of bed at the crack of noon every day, trapped and aimless, trying to decide between starving or moving back in with your parents. After college I looked for a job for a year before finding something worthwhile. That floating year was filled with countless hours at dead end jobs, too much time spent in pajamas, and a general feeling of hopelessness.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3238" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3238" data-attachment-id="3238" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/27/my-clash-at-demonhead/power-of-love1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/power-of-love1.jpg" data-orig-size="1600,1120" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="power-of-love1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/power-of-love1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/power-of-love1.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/power-of-love1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=210" alt="Power of Love" title="power-of-love1" width="300" height="210" class="size-medium wp-image-3238" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/power-of-love1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=210 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/power-of-love1.jpg?w=600&amp;h=420 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/power-of-love1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3238" class="wp-caption-text">Scott Pilgrim levels up</p></div> Scott Pilgrim’s world so closely mirrors my own that I can’t help but like it. Scott’s in the same leaky boat as most recent college grads: jobless and vaguely depressed about an economy that tanked before he even got on board. He’s lost and lazy and spends his days hanging out with friends playing video games. Only when Scott’s not dragging his feet, he’s a slacker hero of sorts. He fends off evil exes and levels up. He punches guys through walls, defeats a half-ninja, and earns the power of love. He pulls a flaming sword. Out. Of. His. Chest. </p>
<p>Scott and his friends wax apathetic. It’s cool not to care, and the way to live your life is mostly to not live it. Squander days in bed. Wander without a destination. Work a dead-end job. Watch your bank accounts go negative. Get your heart completely busted by someone who was probably never worth your time in the first place. Spend months malnourished and heartbroken. Fall in love again suddenly and completely. Battle your enemies. Level up. Earn the power of love. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The post-holiday, non-magical half of the winter is officially upon us, folks, bringing with it salt hardened pant legs and frozen lungs. If there’s one thing I like about the reclusive dog days of winter, it’s all the extra time that having no life frees up for reading. Fact: without distractions like sun, friends, and the world outside my apartment my free time increases exponentially&mdash;I read at least seventeen times as much when I can see my breath outside.</p>
<p>I know a few people who take their winter reading very seriously, selecting only bricks over 600 pages or anything that could reasonably be classified as canon. While Russian literature has its merits, nothing pleases me more than settling down on a cold winter’s morn with my coffee and a nice comic book. To be fair, as someone who was a lit major in undergrad and now works in publishing, I like my word-picture ratio to weigh in around 50/50.</p>
<p>I wasn’t always a consumer of visual tales; however, before college and a crash course in the joys of web comics from dormmates I had hardly perused any panels outside the newspaper. I spent the next three years blindly in love with web comics, following them from site to site with hearts for eyes. </p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3065" style="width: 251px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3065" data-attachment-id="3065" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/20/watching-out-for-alison-bechdel/bechdel/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bechdel.jpeg" data-orig-size="241,209" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bechdel" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bechdel.jpeg?w=241" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bechdel.jpeg?w=241" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bechdel.jpeg?w=640" alt="Bechdel" title="bechdel"   class="size-full wp-image-3065" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bechdel.jpeg 241w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/bechdel.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3065" class="wp-caption-text">Alison Bechdel</p></div> And then, as swift as a train wreck, everything changed. I fell hopelessly in love with my soul mate, Alison Bechdel. I’ll be the first to admit that’s unrequited&mdash;she never once returned my calls.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3066" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/20/watching-out-for-alison-bechdel/funhome/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/funhome.jpg" data-orig-size="267,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="funhome" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/funhome.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/funhome.jpg?w=267" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/funhome.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" alt="Fun Home" title="funhome" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3066" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/funhome.jpg?w=200&amp;h=300 200w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/funhome.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150 100w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/funhome.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /> By chance I picked up a copy of <em>Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic</em> at Schuler Books, a local bookstore in East Lansing, Michigan and in five minutes I was hooked. I bought the hard cover, something I did exactly once as a college student and spent the rest of the day flying through this graphic memoir.  For those of you who missed the <em>Fun Home</em> train when it came tearing through America in 2006 with a place on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list and multiple awards, I’ll provide a brief synopsis, everyone else should feel free to skip ahead. <em>Fun Home</em> recounts the coming-of-age of a girl as she grapples with the pitfalls of childhood in small town America, escapes to college, realizes she’s gay, loses her father, and somehow survives it all. The subtle quirks (the father who wears Tobias-style jean shorts, has a passion for decorating, and moonlights as an undertaker in his family’s funeral home) are what give this relatable story its heart. For anyone who’s ever been gay and not known it, this book will feel a little like home. And for everyone else it will probably just feel brilliant.</p>
<p>My introduction to Bechdel’s work, like most of the people I know, was a little backward.  In some circles, she is, and should be, best known for her long-running comic strip <em>Dykes to Watch Out For</em>. I was given this book as a graduation present from one of my writing professors, and opening that book in her office is one of my favorite college memories. The strip first appeared in 1983 and I can’t help thinking how much better my life would have been if I’d grown up reading it. Bechdel is a small-town lesbian, which seems like an anomaly but isn’t. As most of America is made up of small towns and even smaller towns, most lesbians live and love in the heart of these one-stop-light stomping grounds. Or at least hail from there before escaping to urban epicenters of tentative acceptance. </p>
<p><em>DTWOF</em>, yes, that’s a real acronym used by people in the know, started out as a series of unconnected strips, but by 1987 narrowed its focus. The strip zeroed in on Mo, a loveable neurotic with no fashion sense, and her lesbian entourage and appeared in dozens of newspapers nationwide. The strip followed Mo and her friends through lust and heart ache, babies and betrayal, bad jobs and even worse jobs in their small town <a target="new" href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/dtwof-episode-527">until its (better not be permanent) hiatus in 2008</a>.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3067" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/20/watching-out-for-alison-bechdel/dtwof-6/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dtwof-6.jpg" data-orig-size="600,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dtwof-6" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dtwof-6.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dtwof-6.jpg?w=600" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dtwof-6.jpg?w=640" alt="DTWOF" title="dtwof-6"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3067" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dtwof-6.jpg 600w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dtwof-6.jpg?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/dtwof-6.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Bechdel’s brilliance is sharpest in her details. <em>DTWOF</em>, though a little lousy with unfortunate haircuts, has some of the best fake newspaper headlines I’ve ever seen, certainly on par with Weekend Update. One of my favorite subtle jokes appeared in the form of a newscast ticker that read <a target="new" href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/episode-488">“If the mainstream media insists that Stephen Colbert’s Bush Roast wasn’t funny do they make a sound?”</a></p>
<p>So what’s a lady to do once she’s read every panel she can possibly get her hands on by one Alison Bechdel? Impatiently await her next memoir, of course. The Wikipedia rumor mill claims the book’s working title is <em>Love Life: A Case Study</em>, and is said to chronicle her relationships. <a href="http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/20/stray-questions-for-alison-bechdel/">In the <em>NYT</em>’s Paper Cuts blog</a>, Bechdel describes the book as “a new graphic memoir about the self, subjectivity, desire, the nature of reality, that sort of thing.” I have my fingers crossed for an advance copy mailed to me personally by the comic Rachel Maddow of my heart.</p>
