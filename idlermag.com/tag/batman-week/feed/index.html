										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always loved Batman. Always. Once of the greatest thrills I have encountered as a parent has been my son’s love of Batman. It sure seems easier now to be a fan at a young age, what with all the cartoons on the tube or the toys at the fast food joints. For this last Halloween my son went as Batman. Not only did he dress as Batman, but his costume was sewn by my mom, who made my own Batman costume 28 years ago. In the midst of my Bat-fandom of the late 80s was the first Batman film since the 60s, Tim Burton’s simply-titled <em>Batman</em>. Bat-merch was everywhere in 1989. I bought my first pair of Chuck Taylor shoes that summer, with the Batman logo all over the shoes. They were dope and they were stolen out of my car that summer. Apart from the shoes the other notable thing to me was the music from the movie. I vividly remember tuning in to 92.1 The Ape around six in the morning and hearing Prince’s new song from the film, &#8220;Batdance.&#8221; Loved it. I remember going to Wherehouse Records and buying the cassette single and listening to it until the soundtrack was released. I bought the soundtrack by Prince AND the score by Danny Eflman. I listened to them all the time.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgq3UaATX_U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Somehow listening to this music made sense as the one initial thing I remember about Batman was the theme song from the original, Adam West film in the 1960s. You can’t miss it and you can’t forget it. Da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na BATMAN! There is a version of that theme on YouTube where <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vHGnKZgmlk">a pug says Batman</a>. My son loves it and this appears to be what YouTube was created for. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmxwHr57C1Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Enough interruptions, let&#8217;s get back to the Batman theme. When Jack was beginning to get into Batman I played him the song in the first version I could think of, the version by The Who. Released in 1966 on the <em>Ready Steady Who</em> EP, the version by The Who isn’t too different from the TV version. It might be a bit more amped up, a bit more thrashy, a bit more ‘Oo. One could argue that their version becomes the standard as the next time I remember hearing a comparable version comes from The Jam, who covered it on their debut LP <em>In The City</em> in 1977. As the Jam were dedicated Mods their version was really just the Who version in newer clothes. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXmPEsuipUw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I see the song as one of those garage rock totems, the type of song that is easy to learn and easy to play and perfect. It is up there with &#8220;Road Runner&#8221; and &#8220;Stepping Stone&#8221; as one of the formative, first songs your band would learn to play. And there is nothing wrong with that in my mind, better to have something that is easy to perfect. The world would be boring if everyone could cover Emerson Lake and Palmer songs. </p>
<p>Now what I’m gonna write about here has something to do with Batman but not in the way you think. In 1966 there was a record associated with the original Batman TV series, a record entitled <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> and credited to The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale. The record is total 60s dancey pop, real cheap soul music created to make the kids dance. But there is something different about this LP, something that takes it, well, that takes it to Mars. That difference is one Herman Poole Blount otherwise known as Sun Ra. Sun Ra! Playing Hammond B-3. And what a difference he makes.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-mDUzqPLRU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>While completely Bat-themed with song titles referring to specific characters in the series or events that would set the show’s mood they have nothing to do with Batman. There is not one bit of music that you would remember from the old TV show. Nothing on the record relates to the series except for the theme song. The versions I mentioned before by The Who and The Jam rocked. This version swings. Hard.  The first sound you hear is a drone on the organ, then the drums and then the horns. And the swing just gets you, hits you right where you dance.  A gaggle of soulful sisters sing the lyrics and that organ shines, punching through the songs and adding so much. Coupled with the punchy horn section and you have the classic. This is the song to watch go-go dancers dance to, a song for groovy cats and kittens to swing and shimmy to. I can’t get enough of it. </p>
<p>The Batman theme is much like the Spider-Man theme, a brief moment of song that will continue to become a relic due to the superceding versions of product that are released in the name of the character. There is no soundtrack to Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. The music in <em>The Dark Knight</em> is atonal and high pitched, nothing with a traditional melody. I doubt it will be any different during the third installment of the film. If anything, Batman is now a character that allows for no levity. The films, the video games (best comic video game I’ve ever played is <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>), everything related to Batman has an undertone of decay. I love it, don’t get me wrong, but one does find oneself missing the camp every now and again. </p>
<p>When I listen to this record, I really miss the lightness that was originally bundled within the Batman franchise. Before Michael Keaton, Joel Schumacher, before Bat-nipples, before Christian Bale, and before Val Kilmer there was a show that embraced the happy go luckiness of the times and produced something that fit within that present day. Can our times really have gotten so much darker? And if the mood changed would the music?</p>
<p>Who knows? I’m happy to have had Batman in my life for all these years, I get a kick out of my son being into the character and I eagerly await the next installment in the Arkham video game series. Whenever I get into a Bat-mood I will whip on this CD and just let the joy take over and feel like a kid again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Batman first appeared in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/02/they-knew-it-was-batman-week/" target="_blank"><em>Detective Comics</em> #27 in 1939</a>.  Since then he has been called The Bat-Man, the Caped Crusader, the World’s Greatest Detective and the Dark Knight, amongst other names. He is a character that has been lent to as many interpretations as nicknames (more, actually) over the years and has graced the silver screen no less than eight times, not including the upcoming <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> (2012), but certainly including the only animated theatrical release, <em>Mask of the Phantasm</em> (1993). In those eight films, Batman has fallen under the direction of Leslie H. Martinson, Tim Burton, Eric Radonski and Bruce Timm, Joel Schumacher, and Christopher Nolan, each adding their own interpretations to the Batman mythos, and with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman: The Movie" src="https://i0.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51B63R5GNGL.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="285" />Leslie H. Martinson, for example, brought us <em><strong>Batman: the Movie</strong></em> (1966) (BAM!) a camp-schlock extravaganza (POW!) starring Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin (KERFUFFLE?). The film, which grew out of the 60’s TV series, concerns Batman’s primary rogues gallery (the Joker, the Riddler, the Penguin and Catwoman) joining forces in a fiendish plot to. . . dehydrate people. Yes, fiendish. It contains some truly brilliant moments, including Batman fending off a shark attack with his handy bat-shark-repellent and a delightful little game of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUGCQXLq9wk" target="_blank">free association</a> culminating in Batman, Robin, and the Commissioner miraculously (and hilariously) uncovering just who is behind this fiendish (soooo fiendish) plot to give everyone cotton mouth. The only thing more fun than watching this nonsense is listening to the DVD commentary provided by the dynamic duo of delusion, West and Ward themselves! (KAPLOOEY!)</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Batman '89" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.batman-movies.com/images/batman-movies/batman-movie-poster-5.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="277" />Tim Burton stepped up to the plate with his own darker version of the Batman in 1989’s lazily titled <em><strong>Batman</strong></em>, with an unlikely Michael Keaton pulling on the cowl in the title role. Keaton, while a bit older and more quirky than the Bruce Wayne we&#8217;ve come to expect, manages to fit pretty nicely into Burton’s more stylized, film noir Gotham City. And although Burton has done away with much of the campiness of the 60’s series, <em>Batman</em>&#8216;s often over-the-top dialog and repeated use of Dutch camera angles definitely hints at a certain fondness for the bat-camp of the past. Jack Nicholson’s Joker is certainly more <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjiIHfKwi0Q" target="_blank">Cesar Romero</a> than Heath Ledger (More to come on that).</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman Returns" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.globalwebcasters.com/images/divx/batman-returns.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="272" />As is often the case when a director is allowed to do more than one entry into a series, Burton’s second dance with the devil in the pale moonlight was a bit too much of a good thing. <em><strong>Batman Returns</strong></em>, released in 1992, featured some even sillier dialog, a lamer villain (the Penguin, eh? Oh, and he controls real penguins? AND he’s played by Danny Devito?!), a slightly cooler villain (Christopher Walken, simultaneously adding and subtracting from the film with his weirdness), a purrrfectly over-the-top Catwoman (I don’t care what anyone says, I don’t like this character and Michelle Pfieffer did little to change that) and even Dutchier Dutch camera angles! Keaton is given little to do but wade through the weird.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Mask of the Phantasm" src="https://i2.wp.com/images.wikia.com/dcanimated/images/2/24/Batman_Mask_of_the_Phantasm.jpg" alt="" width="196" height="275" />In 1993 directors Eric Radomski and Bruce Timm brought an animated Batman to the silver screen for the first time with <em><strong>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</strong></em>. Drawing from the phenomenal animated series, <em>Mask</em> was a fine entry into the filmography, but was largely ignored by moviegoers outside of the series’ fans. Mark Hamill (Yes, THAT Mark Hamill) always seems to be having a great time as the voice of the Joker and I’ve long held the opinion that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3zJxF-0N3Y">Kevin Conroy’s Batman voice</a> should totally be overdubbed into Christian Bale’s lozenge craving throat.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman Forever" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.exotica.org.uk/mediawiki/files/thumb/d/da/Batman_Forever_(dvd_cover).jpg/300px-Batman_Forever_(dvd_cover).jpg" alt="" width="180" height="242" />Speaking of too much of a good thing, that’s exactly how Joel Schumacher started his bat-reign with 1995’s <em><strong>Batman Forever</strong></em>. Taking the baby-step backwards that would lead to the giant leap (see below), <em>Forever</em> built upon Burton’s silliness while disregarding most of the noir element that helped make the silliness more palatable. The shadows were replaced with brightly colored gel lighting and the villains became larger than life. It’s not a terrible film, but it’s certainly not a good one either. Val Kilmer is, in my opinion, the most bland and forgettable of all the Batmen, and we are finally (and regrettably) introduced to Robin, played with unfortunate zeal by Chris O’Donnell.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Batman and Robin" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/batman26robin.jpg?w=175&#038;h=268" alt="" width="175" height="268" />Schumacher followed it up by throwing a rock into the bat signal with <em><strong>Batman and Robin</strong></em> (1997), a ridiculous spectacle that would play quite nicely as a sequel to Martinson’s ’66 film. Remember when I mentioned Val Kilmer being the most bland and forgettable Batman? George Clooney should be so lucky. He’s officially the worst Batman of the bunch, although, to his credit he is quite aware of that fact as he has publicly blamed himself for &#8220;single-handedly destroying the franchise.&#8221; Bless his heart. Because I think Clooney&#8217;s too classy to, I&#8217;ll plop some blame for his unfortunate portrayal into Schumacher&#8217;s lap as well. Couple that with another dose of Robin’s inanity, the introduction of Batgirl, Uma Thurman’s ham sandwich performance as Poison Ivy and Schwartzenegger’s nightmare puns as Mr. Freeze (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRH-Ywpz1_I" target="_blank">Everybody chill</a>!) and you’ve got Batman on Broadway with the Andrew Lloyd Weber tunes traded for a few bat-nipples.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Batman Begins" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.gamexchanger.co.uk/images/B000B73GYE/main.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="300" />Then, in 2005, Christopher Nolan brought us <em><strong>Batman Begins</strong></em>. Dark, realistic and intelligent, the film takes Batman to places not yet explored outside of the comic book sphere. It is the first of the films to really take any time with Bruce Wayne, here portrayed by Christian Bale as a determined, haunted man. The loss of his parents and, in particular, his father has led him to confront his fears and eventually embody them. And even though the handling of the villains is superb in <em>Begins</em> (Cillian Murphy&#8217;s Scarecrow is killer), they really take a backseat to Bruce&#8217;s story. I believe that it is in <em>Batman Begins</em> that Bruce becomes more comfortable in the cowl than outside of it. His mansion, his cars, his fancy suits are the real disguise. This is Batman&#8217;s inception (See what I did there?).</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Dark Knight" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.wildsound-filmmaking-feedback-events.com/images/the_dark_knight_dvd.jpg" alt="" width="186" height="263" />If the villains took a backseat in Nolan&#8217;s first bat-flick, then they take the driver&#8217;s seat (and probably stole it) in <em><strong>The Dark Knight</strong></em> (2008). It&#8217;s safe to say that crazy attracts crazy, and Bruce begins to see some of the ramifications for his particular brand of street justice when the Joker decides to use Gotham as his personal psych project. I will not spend time praising Heath Ledger&#8217;s Joker performance (Okay, maybe a little: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wQXSd1Jbqc" target="_blank">It&#8217;s phenomenal</a>!), it&#8217;s been praised to death. What I will praise is the Nolan brothers&#8217; screenplay, which focuses more on the big picture this time around. Batman/Bruce is forced to confront himself in the face of a villain whose motivations are far less black-and-white than his own. And even as he turns to Harvey Dent to be the &#8220;white knight&#8221; he cannot, his hopes are crushed by tragedy, Dent becoming another victim of the system, anarchy&#8217;s cold indifference and the Batman himself. It may not be the perfect Batman film (<em>Begins</em> is actually a lot closer to my ideal Batman, despite being a lesser overall film), but it&#8217;s a near perfect crime saga.</p>

<ul>
<li>Typically has a sidekick to explain things to (Robin, or <em>The Brave and the Bold</em> guest star)</li>
<li>Full of bizarrely specific gadgets (usually named Bat-somethings)</li>
<li>Can deduce the strangest of mysteries from only a few small clues</li>
<li>The only Bat that smiles</li>
<li>Can be heinously cheesy&mdash;fun when it works (West) and awful when it doesn’t (Clooney)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hard-Boiled Bat</strong>&mdash;Early 1940s comic Batman</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the myth, there was simply the Batman</li>
<li>Fought gangsters and criminals, carries a gun (and wasn’t afraid to use it)</li>
<li>Psychological state is less nuanced</li>
<li>Take away the weird outfit and he’s basically a tough 40s vigilante cop/detective</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deus Ex Batmachina</strong>&mdash;Star of DC Universe Animated movies; plutocrat and owner of the Justice League of America space station.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always ready to swoop in with a literal <em>deus ex machina</em>: some bat-device that keeps the story moving</li>
<li>Faceless and cold</li>
<li>Never appears as Bruce Wayne&mdash;mask and man meld</li>
<li>Is really just there to explain billions of dollars of sciencey stuff</li>
<li>Often a paranoid loner, but always a key member of the group</li>
<li>Has sci-fi gadgets and power armor to keep up with cosmic heroes like Superman and Green Lantern</li>
<li>Were it <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> he’d be Brad Pitt&mdash;cool, calm, hierarchically in the top 3</li>

<ul>
<li>Cranky old man with an edge</li>
<li>More of his shadowy psychology is unpacked, detailed and expanded through these storylines</li>
<li>End of Batman’s life has him losing perspective on his own beginnings and his reasons for being Batman in the first place</li>
<li>Luckily, he usually has a protege around to remind him of his purpose and power</li>
<li>Like a worn out wrestler, he’s still a hulking force but slower, craggy, broken and world-weary</li>

<ul>
<li>Batman before he has all his moves down</li>
<li>Struggling to deal with his role as a vigilante</li>
<li>Hungry, he aims to educate himself on how to be a fighter, a hero, a person</li>
<li>You might see a Rocky-esque training montage and learn about the ridiculously long line of lionhearted justice seekers in the Wayne family tree (relatives who created a stop on the Underground Railroad?! Nolan, I’m looking at you)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balanced Batman, the Dark Knight</strong>&mdash;<em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>; Tim Burton’s <em>Batman</em>; the best parts of the comics authored by countless writer/artist combos</p>
<ul>
<li>The modern archetype of the Dark Knight. An amalgamation of all of the above</li>
<li>Detective with psychological issues of his own</li>
<li>Realistic(ish) gadgets</li>
<li>A man with a complicated life, not completely hopeless, not cracking punny in clownish lycra</li>
<li>Good old regular Batstuff&mdash;the Batmobile; the Batcave with its trophies of past adventures; Alfred, Robin, and Jim Gordon</li>
</ul>
<p>So Bat-readers, what did we miss? Is there an archetypical Batman story that you know and love that doesn’t fall into one of the above categories? Don’t agree with the archetypes we’ve laid out? Where do all the ladies of Gotham and beyond fit into the Bat Saga? Let’s argue about it in the comments, in true comic book nerd fashion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was always sure I loved Batman. In fact, I was so sure that I never took the time to actually get to know him. It was a celebrity crush that dissolved as quickly as when I read Bieber’s autobio: <em>First Step 2 Forever: My Story</em>. It’s not pretty, friends, this broken heart of mine.</p>

I tend to read a novel and something graphic in tandem because I am hard to please. Unfortunately, the novel I’ve been reading is <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>. It’s. . . clever, but once I set it down I really don’t miss it. So I guess what I’ve really been doing these past few days is nursing yet another in a series of death colds and geeking out on <em>Modern Family</em>.</p>
<p>The graphic novels I like best are a nice blend of drawings and literature. Artsy. I enjoy two-color comics. Black/white or the Bechdel blue/white. They feel modern, clean. They leave the outfits and hair colors open to interpretation. <em>TDKR</em>’s pinkish reds and sunshine yellows were a weak assault. Like the glaucoma test at the eye doctor. I realize there’s much to be said for being true to the origins of the Batman, but I struggled with how dated it all felt: the sunglasses, the belt choices. I found myself scanning the text and art, the words and sentiments as heavy-handed as fan fiction, not being struck by either. And those mutants read like a filler villain akin to the putty men in <em>Power Rangers</em>. You may commence your stone throwing. </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3445" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/03/gaying-up-gotham/ma0510-1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/ma0510-1.jpg" data-orig-size="304,460" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="ma0510-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/ma0510-1.jpg?w=198" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/ma0510-1.jpg?w=304" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/ma0510-1.jpg?w=198&#038;h=300" alt="tvquote" title="ma0510-1" width="198" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3445" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/ma0510-1.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300 198w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/ma0510-1.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/ma0510-1.jpg 304w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /> But then, things got interesting. Late in the first book a concerned Gotham citizen is caught on panel saying,  “Batman? Yeah, I think he’s a-okay. He’s kicking just the right butts&mdash;butts the cops ain’t kicking, that’s for sure. Hope he goes after the homos next” (pg. 45). This panel might have been written to induce a bit of eye-rolling, but what it really does is open a door for a kind of tension to step in.  I make it a habit to withdraw support from anything I see as ’mophobic. This includes, but is not limited to, movies, books, bars, bakeries, and heels.</p>
<p>But what if Miller’s not hating? Out of the big three (Spider/Super/Bat), Batman is arguably the most homoerotic of them all. Hear me out here, friends. I understand that we see things not as they are, but as we are, and that beauty is in the queer eye of the beholder and all of that, but I can’t be the only one seeing this. I couldn’t believe it took me the entire first book to realize that I was the problem. I had been reading Batman as straight. Listen, random Gotham citizen, you best give up that wish, baby. The Batman will never go after his own team. </p>
<p>I had unrealistic expectations for the comic. Like a bride on her wedding day I was expecting to live a dream, to realize suddenly the truth I’d always known. Instead I was just alone at the altar in a terrible dress and impossible heels. And Batman was totally my maid of honor. And just like RuPaul, the Dark Knight won me over. I want to be the best contestant his crime-fighting drag race has ever seen. </p>

<p>Suddenly I couldn’t not see the Batman as a homohero. It’s everywhere: all of the <em>Dark Knight</em> panels in which Bruce has a mustache, the panel in which he and Harvey “tumble like lovers,” his elbow-high gloves. And tumble they do, their bodies entwined, embracing as they crash through a window It’s hard to deny the homoeroticism of men wrestling in tight costumes. I mean, you remember high school. For a supplemental example check out <a target="new" href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=295">Kate Beaton’s revealing portrait of the hero in his off-hours</a>. The Batman I love is also featured as the fabulous spandex-clad rich guy asking Robin for fashion advice in <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W19wr5rXVHk&amp;feature=fvw">this revealing documentary</a>.</p>
<p>I find I’m still attracted to the idea of classic, masculine, straight Batman, the franchise of power and skintight darkness. Would I buy the t-shirt? Doubtful. Would I marry Robin in a heartbeat? I’ve already bought the ring. </p>
<p>Is it really so outrageous that a tale about a totally ripped dude clothed entirely in a skin tight spandex/armor situation might not love the ladies? This isn’t a threat. My reading Batman as gay is just that. Our heroes can’t always be straight/white/macho/republican. In fact, I prefer mine to deviate. To some extent, I think we all prefer a dark streak in our heroes. The secrets, the hidden identity, the desire for vengeance, all of these things add the shadow of mystery. Take the hero beyond boy scout.   </p>

There’s no denying the blinding sparks when the Joker, biting his lip, addresses Batman as &#8220;darling&#8221; when first lays eyes on the Bat&#8217;s silhouette at the carnival. Or Batman’s suggestive panels on the page next: “Can you see it, Joker? Feels to me. . . like it’s written all over my face. I’ve lain awake nights. . . picturing it. . . From the beginning I knew that there’s nothing wrong with you that I can’t fix. . .” (pg.142). And what’s the nature of the Batman’s psychosis, you ask? “Why, sexual repression, of course.” The exact opposite of the Joker’s lack of restraint. That their battle royale takes place in the Tunnel of Love is no coincidence. Because they could never complete each other and stay who they are, because Batman will never step forth from the cave and strip off his restraint, each attempts to destroy his counterpart.  The Joker is left heartbroken and deceased. </p>
<p>Frank Miller is quoted as saying Batman “would be healthier if he were gay.” Maybe he’d just be healthier if he were out. It’s not always shame or denial or fear that keeps a person from coming out. Often it’s ease and a belief that secrecy buys safety. </p>
<p>When I think about hidden identities I think about closets. I think about Clark ducking in to change and emerging in his unitard, freer and braver and ready for life. I think about Bruce entering the cave and Batman emerging.</p>
<p>The entire superhero genre hinges on the concealing of identity in pursuit of truth, freedom, power, really great boots. By day, Batman lives the life men are supposed to emulate. He has power, money, success. At night, he’s the ultimate badass, transferring all passion and aggression into fighting crime, driving fast, cracking skulls. Women throw themselves at him, but he never truly engages. He chooses instead to pursue his criminals, his villains. He becomes deeply involved with his nemeses, plays psychological games, creates obsessive, lasting relationships. Miller famously described the Batman-Joker dynamic as a “homophobic nightmare.” These interactions are what truly fulfill Batman. They complete him.  </p>
<p>My advice: shed the mask, but definitely keep the boots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, Batman fans have suffered. Though many of us are avid video game players (it should be no surprise that a large portion of the demographics for  comic books and video games overlap), we’ve been presented with subpar game after subpar game. Jump, run, throw things, and repeat until you get to the guy with green hair.</p>
<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>But then, a couple of years ago, someone finally figured it out. After years of waiting, gamers were finally able to get their hands on an experience that really got the Dark Knight, that finally offered enough ins and outs to satisfy both the gamer and the comic book fan. We finally got what we were waiting for.</p>
<p>I am, of course, referring to <em>LEGO Batman</em>.</p>

I’ve fought my way past Victor Zsasz, beat up some thugs, and swung around from gargoyles. All of this was great fun, and I’m a huge Paul Dini fan. (Dini was responsible for the <em>Arkham Asylum</em> storyline, and was one of the primary writers for <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>. Also <em>LOST</em>.) But still, <em>Arkham</em> hasn’t quite sucked me in, and when it comes down to it, <em>LEGO Batman</em> beat it to the punch.</p>
<p>I was, in all honesty, a bit worried about <em>LEGO Batman</em> after having played the two <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games, which were wonderful. They were imaginative, clever, and funny. The Jedi characters could use the force to reshape their Lego-constructed environments, and the game was designed to reward replay. Each level had areas that could only be accessed when playing a second time in “Free Play” mode, where the player is given access to a set of alternate player characters, each with their own unique abilities.</p>
<p>Also, <em>LEGO Indiana Jones</em> was terrible. (I don’t really want to talk about it anymore.)</p>

While <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> created a number of distinct character classes, each of whom had a unique ability (Jedi, Dark Jedi, blaster characters, and Jar-Jar Binks, who can jump really high—yes, this is actually useful—and the second game expanded to include distinct abilities for Imperial characters and bounty hunters), in <em>LEGO Batman</em> most villains have a unique ability, and even Batman and Robin can perform different tasks by donning different ability suits.</p>
<p>Even better, <em>LEGO Batman</em>, compared to the <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> games, is nearly two games rolled into one, as every storyline can be played from both Batman’s and the villains’ point of view, each with its own distinct levels.  In effect, you get to clean up the bad guys’ mess, and then go back and create it all over again.</p>

If you get tired of Batman and Robin, you can unlock Batgirl and Nightwing, who have similar abilities, but, well, look more awesome. Hidden within the character builder feature (which was available in the second <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> game, but didn’t seem to serve much of a purpose) are pieces that allow you to construct a number of secondary characters from the Batman comics such as Azrael and the Spoiler. (I play as the Spoiler all the time. Stephanie Brown doesn’t get near enough respect, and I was giddy when I found out she had been included. Azrael, on the other hand, can go to hell. Seriously. He sucks.)</p>
<p>I’m actually looking forward to giving <em>Arkham Asylum</em> another try. It&#8217;ll be worth it just to spend a little more time with Mark Hamill’s brilliant interpretation of the Joker. But there’s something a little bit wrong about the construction of a game like <em>Arkham Asylum</em>. When you really get into Batman, when you take the character seriously and try to envision <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/31/what-makes-the-bat/">a “realistic” take on what makes him tick</a>, you have to confront the fact that being the Batman is not and cannot be a very pleasant experience. Unless he’s a sadist (see Frank Miller’s <em>All-Star Batman and Robin</em>), he can’t really enjoy much what he does. There will always be someone he cannot save, all the way back to the parents who were murdered in front of his eyes. Thus, the more &#8220;realistic&#8221; a Batman game is, the less pleasant it should be to play.</p>
<p>Batman comics, however, are frequently unrealistic, constantly inventive, and a great deal of fun. Just like <em>LEGO Batman</em>.</p>

We are, however, silent movie people, and apparently we weren’t the first to notice that the grotesque, prosthetic smile once worn onscreen by German actor Conrad Veidt looks an awful lot like the Joker. As is the case with many comic book characters who grow into icons and major, recognizable properties, there is much back-and-forth about who was <em>really</em> responsible for creating the Joker. But since it is referenced in the title of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Batman-Man-Laughs-Ed-Brubaker/dp/1401216269/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1296612114&amp;sr=1-1">a 2005 Batman comic</a>, I feel pretty okay saying that it is generally thought that the 1928 silent film <em>The Man Who Laughs</em> was an inspiration for the look of the Joker when the character first appeared in 1940. </p>
<p>Mostly the dispute is not over whether or not <em>The Man Who Laughs</em> was brought up, but at what point. And the argument I think is less over whether Veidt’s portrayal of Gwyneplaine in the silent film was an influence, but more so who gets to lay claim to the creation of the Joker character. Batman creator Bob Kane says he and co-creator Bill Finger invented the character and used <em>The Man Who Laughs</em> as an influence, whereas artist and Robin co-creator Jerry Robinson says that <em>The Man Who Laughs</em> was not brought up until <em>after</em> he first did a Joker card sketch. Regardless of who is right, both parties cite that the likeness of Veidt’s grinning Gwyneplaine was referenced in some capacity before any of the comic pages for <em>Batman</em> #1&mdash;the issue The Joker first appears in&mdash;were drawn. So for the purposes of the character’s first printed appearance, yes&mdash;<em>The Man Who Laughs</em> was at least mentioned, and stills of actor Conrad Veidt in makeup were possibly passed around among the people above at ye olde’ DC headquarters.</p>

In the story, the cheeks of a seventeenth-century English child named Gwyneplaine are sliced to give the effect of a perpetual grin, a punishment by King James II, who has already had the child’s father executed. Gwyneplaine’s disfigurement is carried out by “Comprachicos”: gypsy surgeons who operate on children and then use them in freakshows (the word “Comprachicos” was concocted by Hugo from the Spanish word “Comprapequenos” which means, “child-buyers”). </p>
<p>Most of the movie focuses on adult-Gwyneplaine, played hauntingly by German actor Conrad Veidt. The actor was already a legend for his appearances in other silent films like the 1920 <em>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</em> (a still from which was used on Bauhaus’ 1982 &#8220;Bela Lugosi’s Dead&#8221; single, which you will probably recognize if you’re over thirty like I am), <em>The Hands of Orlac</em> (1924), <em>Waxworks</em> (1924) and many others. Veidt himself is a fascinating man as well as a gifted and enigmatic performer, who staunchly opposed the Nazi regime and fled Germany with his Jewish wife in 1933, relocating to the United Kingdom. Ironically, because of his accent, Veidt often ended up playing Nazis in later talkie films, including <em>Casablanca</em> (1942), one of the last movies he appeared in before his untimely death at age 50. Veidt also played what is thought to be the first gay character written for the screen in the 1919 German film, <em>Different from the Others</em>.</p>

The prosthetic was created by Universal Studios makeup artist Jack Pierce, who later collaborated with Boris Karloff on the makeup for the original <em>Frankenstein</em> (1931) and <em>The Mummy</em> (1931), and who also designed <em>The Wolfman</em> (1941) makeup. The prosthetic is said to be patterned after one worn by Lon Chaney Sr., who had originally been chosen to play Gwyneplaine, but who was under contract with MGM and also was shying away from makeup-heavy roles at that time. Really, it’s difficult now to imagine anyone other than Veidt as this gentle, tragic, ostracized and persecuted character. Because Veidt could not move his mouth at all while wearing the prosthetic (or in some scenes, his mouth is covered by a scarf), he gives his entire, transfixing performance using only his eyes and brows. The effect is heartbreaking. And the prosthetic was reportedly very painful to wear. </p>
<p>One can’t deny the striking resemblance of the Joker to Veidt’s Gwyneplaine in <em>The Man Who Laughs</em>. The frozen, disturbed, unwelcoming grin is obvious, but also the pallor, the hair and shape of the hairline, as well as the dashing actor’s strong, distinguished nose. But the similarities between these two characters end with appearances as Gwyneplaine&mdash;a misunderstood monster and result of grievous classism&mdash;is the good guy, and not the villain.  </p>

My parents had a copy of the original 60’s TV series theme song on vinyl. Soon my sister and I were given fighting action figurines of Batman, Robin, The Penguin, and The Joker. Batman and Robin had real fabric capes and if you squeezed their legs together an arm would move in a punching sort of motion. . . kind of. We loved them. Then one evening I left Batman on the coffee table and the next morning found him in a mangled mess on the floor, a victim of our black Labrador. I remember how much I cried over it. Batman was my favorite of the bunch and I had been responsible for his death. The Joker, being the most bad-ass of the action figures left (Robin and The Penguin didn’t quit cut it) absolutely became my favorite Batman villain. So I treasured my Joker, dashing in his purple suit and spats, the one remaining toy to remind me of the greatness that had once been my little plastic punching Batman.</p>
<p>A few years later a local TV channel started running the Adam West Batman television series. Of course, I watched them every day, fascinated by shiny capes and Robin’s green, pointy, cuffed shoes. Having re-watched the movie that was born from this series as an adult, I can see why I loved it so much as a child. Everything was ridiculous and stupid, but Batman and Robin could solve crimes with such an asinine string of logic that I, as a child, could somehow follow it or at least be impressed by it because I had a tiny child brain that didn’t realize how ridiculous it really was. It was also very colorful and used capital letters and simple words like “BIFF!” and “POW!” and “KA-BOOM!” during fight scenes, words I wouldn’t ever find on Sesame Street (which may explain why I never watched Sesame Street. Not enough punching.)</p>

It was one of the highlights of my tiny life. I played in the backyard all the time with my young friend Max who loved Batman with all the typical enthusiasm of a superhero-crazed five-year-old. He would be Batman/Bruce Wayne and I would be everybody else (which was difficult when I, as Vicki Vale, would have to kidnap by myself as the Joker). Max and I spent hours setting boundaries for the Batcave and Joker’s hideout, sorting through various toys deciding what would make a good smoke bomb and which jump rope should be used as a zip line. We’d play Batman outside in summer when it was dark, dressed all in black, taking turns defeating each other as hero and villain. When the mosquitoes finally got the best of us we’d go inside, snuggle into sleeping bags on the floor and watch the movie again for the umpteenth time as we drifted off to sleep. 	</p>

Though technically a cartoon, this series was way more mature in its storytelling than the Adam West series.  Animated Batman’s train of thought and logic seemed to be based more on real facts as opposed to: This happened out at sea. . . so C for Catwoman!! (Wha?? Really? I’m not even sure Catwoman put that much thought into it, but I guess I’ll go with it.) It was through this glorious cartoon that I was introduced to villains I never met in the Adam West series or the Tim Burton films. Scarecrow, Clayface, Killer Croc, The Mad Hatter, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Bane, The Ventriloquist, and Ra’s al Ghul.  And although the Joker (voiced by the amazing Mark Hamill) was still my number-one guy, I was happy to let his leading lady, Harley Quinn, sneak into my heart as well.  Finally I could finally pretend to be a badass chick villain instead of a damsel in distress (and stop having to kidnap myself). </p>

With the release of <em>Batman Returns</em> (1992) and Michelle Pfeiffer&#8217;s Catwoman, Max and my respective older sisters couldn’t help but join the fun (though they had to invent a character named “Kitty Girl” so they could both play. There could only be one Catwoman).  By the time Val Kilmer donned the rubber suit in <em>Batman Forever</em> (1995), we were too old for that sort of thing, but Max and I were so in love with Jim Carey that we often just talked about how much we loved the Riddler and quoted him constantly until our sisters threatened to kill us.</p>
<p>The summer <em>Batman Begins</em> (2005) was released was also the summer I was to graduate from college.  To be more exact, the <em>Batman Begins</em> release date was the same day as my graduation ceremony.  I was very excited about it, but had worked hard and was very proud about finishing school. </p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>BAT.</p>
<p>MAN.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_3398" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3398" data-attachment-id="3398" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/01/batman-a-memoir/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02.jpg" data-orig-size="419,629" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="dark-knight-batman-gallery-02" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02.jpg?w=419" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="Bale Batman" title="dark-knight-batman-gallery-02" width="199" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-3398" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02.jpg?w=199&amp;h=300 199w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02.jpg?w=398&amp;h=597 398w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/dark-knight-batman-gallery-02.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150 100w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /><p id="caption-attachment-3398" class="wp-caption-text">Christian Bale as Batman</p></div> Yes.  I skipped my college graduation and went with future <em>Idler</em> editor Kevin Mattison to see <em>Batman Begins</em>. I have never regretted this decision. I so loved this new telling of Batman that, had it not been the last showing that night, I would have left the theater, gone to the counter and bought a ticket for the next one.  I felt much the same way after <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008). Heath Ledger’s Joker is the kind of crazy I am inexplicably drawn to in a villain. I’m just smitten with him.</p>
<p>In all this, I realize I haven’t actually mentioned why I’m so in love with Batman.  There are plenty of reasons to love him. I won’t go into all the “he’s a mere mortal, trying to do what’s right,” or the “Bruce Wayne is the mask, Batman is the real psyche, isn’t that fascinating?” stuff.  When I think about it I have to say it’s because Batman is my comfort food in the superhero world. I didn’t have any real friends until I was thirteen, except for one, and that one friend of mine played Batman in the backyard with me.  Some of my best childhood memories are of being dressed in black, crouching behind a tree in the dark of a summer night, fighting off mosquitoes while trying not to blow my cover, waiting for a towel-caped Max to come into view so I could fight him, lose, and start all over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of the upcoming <em>The Dark Knight</em> sequel (and the continuing and <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-Af">somewhat problematic Christian Bale interpretation of Bruce Wayne</a>), here are five key traits of the Batman, according to Gavin. (Sources will be cited, but like Frank Miller&#8217;s bat-universe, my bat-universe may diverge slightly from accepted continuity.) </p>
<p>1. <strong>Bruce Wayne is the mask. Batman is the real identity</strong></p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2689" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2689" data-attachment-id="2689" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/31/what-makes-the-bat/overtheedge/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/overtheedge.jpeg" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="overtheedge" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/overtheedge.jpeg?w=259" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/overtheedge.jpeg?w=259" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/overtheedge.jpeg?w=150&#038;h=112" alt="Over the Edge" title="overtheedge" width="150" height="112" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2689" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/overtheedge.jpeg?w=150&amp;h=112 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/overtheedge.jpeg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2689" class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Over the Edge&quot;&mdash;Batgirl dies. (No, that&#039;s not a spolier. That&#039;s the <em>beginning</em> of the episode.)</p></div> There are a number of sources for this idea, but the first place I heard it articulated was by Kevin Conroy, who did Batman/Bruce Wayne&#8217;s voice for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023E894?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00023E894">Batman: The Animated Series</a>. I would go a bit further and play with the idea of Bruce Wayne being just one of Batman&#8217;s masks. There is some precedent for this in the comics: Matches Malone, Lefty Knox. Batman can be anyone, anywhere. Paranoia is at least as powerful as physical intimidation. The man you&#8217;ve worked with for years, your best friend, could be the Bat. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563899337?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1563899337">Bruce Wayne &#8211; Fugitive</a> storyline also plays with the idea of a Batman without Bruce Wayne, and the &#8220;Over the Edge&#8221; episode of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B7QCHC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000B7QCHC">the final (redesigned) season</a> of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> provides another key to that door. Batman would still be Batman even if the Bruce Wayne mask were taken away.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Never during the day</strong></p>
<p>This is a throw-off line from Frank Miller&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401207529?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1401207529">Batman: Year One</a>, which writers ignore at their peril. The Bat doesn&#8217;t make public appearances. He doesn&#8217;t testify in court. The only time you will ever see him is when he takes you down or saves your life, and even then, only for a moment. The Bat only works as a secret, a rumor, a myth. The Bat can never be captured, tied up, or examined under light. The mask is flimsy, and the only way to keep someone from pulling it off is to wear it sparingly. Other masks (see #1) are more durable, and just as useful.</p>
<p>3. <strong>The utility belt has a finite number of pouches</strong></p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2694" style="width: 147px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/utility-belt-contents.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2694" data-attachment-id="2694" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/31/what-makes-the-bat/utility-belt-contents/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/utility-belt-contents.jpeg" data-orig-size="366,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="utility-belt-contents" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/utility-belt-contents.jpeg?w=275" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/utility-belt-contents.jpeg?w=366" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/utility-belt-contents.jpeg?w=137&#038;h=150" alt="Utility belt contents" title="utility-belt-contents" width="137" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2694" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/utility-belt-contents.jpeg?w=137&amp;h=150 137w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/utility-belt-contents.jpeg?w=274&amp;h=300 274w" sizes="(max-width: 137px) 100vw, 137px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2694" class="wp-caption-text">The contents of Batman&#039;s utility belt in <em>Batman: Year 100</em></p></div> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401211925?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1401211925">Batman: Year One Hundred</a> has <a target="new" href="http://everydayislikewednesday.blogspot.com/2008/08/bat-pope-week-creating-caped-crusaders.html">the best take on this</a>. Making Bruce Wayne a man with unlimited resources is ultimately a mistake. Batman is interesting only in his limitations. No superpowers. The only available tools are what he can carry <em>silently</em>. In this spirit, there is no Batmobile. (Also see #2.) Batman does not travel in a marked car that stops at traffic lights and signals left turns. If he drives, it is in an unmarked car, without the mask. Motorcycles make more sense, since a helmet is a mask, but still only something plain and unmarked. Something that can be abandoned.</p>
<p>4. <strong>There is something deeply wrong with Batman</strong></p>
<p>Grant Morrison&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401204252?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1401204252">Arkham Asylum</a> is a good source for this. Batman can&#8217;t be written as totally crazy, because the sense of right and wrong is so essential, but Batman is so hell-bent on rightness, on structure because of something missing inside of himself. He has to spend every moment of his life building order out of chaos because he doesn&#8217;t have that order inside of him. Detective fiction is also instructional: Batman is obsessive/compulsive (look at his trophy room in the Batcave), and either a bit autistic or sociopathic. He remembers everything and constantly has to organize the information in his head before he loses his place. He can&#8217;t relate to people, but is a tremendous actor. He&#8217;s jarringly detached, but he can never let go of anything.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Jason Todd</strong></p>
<p>He was Robin. He died. He&#8217;s dead. Bringing Jason Todd back was the worst decision a Batman writer has ever made, and that&#8217;s saying a lot. The false Jason Todd in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401223176?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1401223176">Hush</a> storyline is interesting. Jason Todd really being alive is not. Losing a Robin, and the guilt Batman feels (or doesn&#8217;t feel?) about it is key to his character. His inability to stop using a sidekick is key, too. Hell, at the time she replaced Tim Drake, Batman didn&#8217;t even like Stephanie Brown. Why do children keep seeking the Batman out, and why is he, the strongest will in the DC universe, unable to say no?</p>
