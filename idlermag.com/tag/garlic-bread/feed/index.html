										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My grandfather wouldn&#8217;t eat garlic. While my family has produced a number of picky eaters, I don&#8217;t normally think of my grandfather as having been one of them. I don&#8217;t remember running into many things that he wouldn&#8217;t eat, although that may be been one of the privileges of eating mostly at one&#8217;s own house and being choosy about where one eats out. I ate a lot of good food with my grandfather, but no garlic.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast to the food I eat with my wife&#8217;s Italian family. When I was a child, pasta sauce was something that came from a jar and was poured over ground beef and noodles. My wife makes her own sauce, sometimes with fresh tomatoes and sometimes with canned, but always, always with fresh garlic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being a picky eater and being a food snob. I&#8217;d like to suggest that in the right hands garlic can sometimes bridge the two. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to do garlic bread. Even a quick search turns up recipes from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Rachel Ray</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/zesty-roasted-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Paula Deen</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Ina Garten</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/herbed-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Tyler Florence</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/guy-fieri/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Guy Fieri</a>, <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-2734" target="_blank">Bon Appétit</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-106583" target="_blank">Gourmet</a></em>. A lot of these involve quantities of cheese, herbs, tomatoes, or some combination of the above, and they&#8217;re all fine.</p>
<p>But as much as I love fresh garlic &#8212; and I do &#8212; garlic powder makes a perfectly good garlic bread. Take any loaf of unsliced crusty bread and cut it in half. Spread butter over both halves. Sprinkle garlic powder on the butter &#8212; a little goes a long way &#8212; and toast both halves under the broiler just until it starts to brown. Share if necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not anything that I would eaten in my grandfather&#8217;s house, but I think of him every time I eat it.</p>
