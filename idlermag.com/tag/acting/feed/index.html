										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always been a great player of pretend. I love telling stories. As I child, I was often accused of having an overactive imagination. When I’d play outside with the neighborhood kids, I’d go beyond the typical “cops and robbers” and do “mob boss versus grizzled detective who’s getting too old for this stuff,” and add a subplot about a wandering preacher whose charisma dupes them both.</p>
<p>I’d perform soliloquies for Stitch, my teddy bear. My G.I. Joes took part in an ever-evolving saga of espionage. My Barbie dolls were the members of a huge and convoluted family tree, and participated in all the drama that comes with it. My mom’s Barbie was the mom. She still wore her makeup and hair exactly the way she did when she was a teenager herself. </p>
<p>Can’t you see it just dates you, Babs? You don’t look any younger!</p>
<p>I was also a voracious reader and movie watcher. I especially dug sci-fi. I saw <em>Alien</em> for the first time when I was eight, and apart from gifting me with the image that still pops up in my nightmares (the baby xenomorph birthing itself from John Hurt’s chest, obviously), it also introduced me to Our Ripley of Nostromo, the first female film character I found entirely relatable. I mean, Leia was close, but at the end of the day? I wanted to be Han Solo. Soon enough, I was calling my cat “Jonesy” and pretending she and I were going into cryostasis when we’d go to bed.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="11123" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/04/12/a-shepard-prepares/jonesyalien/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg" data-orig-size="640,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="JonesyAlien" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=640&#038;h=360" alt="Jonesy" width="640" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11123" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonesyalien.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>She always wanted to sleep directly on my head though, the little facehugger.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be great, I thought, to up the ante? To actually feel like I was on a spaceship? To wear the right clothes, say the right words, and be surrounded by a bunch of people doing the same? To feel really immersed in these worlds? Heck yes, it would. So I decided to become an actor.</p>
<p>And I did, and it was great. I made people laugh and cry (mostly laugh). I met the people who make up my core group of friends. I met my husband. I made contacts that got me my first paying gigs in New York. I told a lot of stories.</p>
<p>However, as with most things that are awesome, there was a catch. While little Sara assumed it was the actors who were at the center of the make-believe, actor Sara discovered it was really the audience (as of course it should be). </p>
<p>It may look like she’s on the deck of spaceship, but she’s actually standing in front of several panels of green spandex. Her costume is held together in the back by safety pins. Half the time, she’s not even talking with the person who appears in the scene with her. Theatre offers her more immersion, but then it’s a constant exchange of energy with the audience, because they’re actually there in the room. That energy exchange is important and wonderful and absolutely thrilling, and I miss it dearly, but there came a time when I realized I was the one who wanted to be fooled.</p>
<p>Enter Commander Shepard, stage right. </p>
<p>I was already well acquainted with the immersive qualities of video games, but <em>Mass Effect</em> took dead aim at my childhood fantasies and struck true. An epic space fantasy spanning three games, where decisions from the first affect outcomes in the second and third, it offered me the chance to be the badass space explorer I always wanted to be. </p>

<p>I stalked the decks of the Normandy. I donned space armors and wielded high tech weapons. I befriended my crew. Flirted with them, too. Some of them died, and I mourned them. I helped some people, and hurt some others. I saved the galaxy. For the most part, I was the good gal, but I followed my own code &#8212; sometimes you just have to use the Renegade interrupt option and blow up that gas tank your opponent is too busy monologuing to notice.</p>
<p>“Boring conversation anyway,” you’ll say out loud from your couch. </p>
<p>A video game tells a story for an audience of one. A great video game lets that audience help tell it. I may never get a chance to play Ripley in the <em>Alien</em> reboot (though I am totally available, Hollywood), but my Shepard ain’t a half bad substitute. Especially because she’s mine.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to tell stories, and I’ve got no plans to stop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor, writer, producer. Villain, vampire, coach. Neil Jackson has worn many faces. In America, he’s known for his performances in <em>Push</em> (2009), <em>Quantum of Solace</em> (2008), <em>Alexander</em> (2004), <em>Blade: The Series</em> and ABC’s <em>Make It or Break It</em>. His British acting resume is equally rich, including such series as <em>Heartbeat</em>, <em>Ultimate Force</em>, <em>Silent Witness</em>, <em>Dream Team</em> and the new <em>Upstairs Downstairs</em>. An active screenwriter, Jackson is also founder of the film, television and theater company Paper Dragon Productions, for which he wrote and starred in the 2007 film <em>The Passage</em>. Formerly, he was a gold-winning competitive boxer. It’s amazing that such a diverse career could belong to one man, but Neil Jackson is no ordinary man. Today, I have the pleasure of asking the multi-talented Mr. Jackson some questions about his craft, his projects, and what helps him prepare for a role.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><em>Your first American role was in Oliver Stone&#8217;s </em>Alexander<em>, correct? What made you decide to pursue acting in American productions when you already had an impressive resume in England?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="8457" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/01/11/interview-with-neil-jackson/neil-jackson-1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg" data-orig-size="299,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="neil-jackson-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=199" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=299" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300" alt="Neil Jackson" title="neil-jackson-1" width="199" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8457" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=199&amp;h=300 199w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150 100w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-1.jpg 299w" sizes="(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px" /> I don&#8217;t think that the lure for me was geographical. As an actor I look for the best work, the projects that excite or resonate with me. Also, at the time, I hadn&#8217;t done a film and this was a huge production with massive stars attached and a director that I respected and admired. The fact that it was an American production wasn&#8217;t a factor in the decision making process for me.</p>
<p><em>For a little while, you seemed to be playing a lot of villains. Did you ever feel typecast as a &#8220;bad guy&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>No, I&#8217;ve never felt typecast playing a villain, though I did start to wonder what it was about me that made me seem more antagonist than protagonist. That has since changed, but I still relish the opportunity to play the &#8220;baddie.&#8221; Their parameters are less defined, meaning that the scope for range in a villain is broader. They live and exist outside of the heroes world and this can be reflected in the performance, which is a lot of fun.</p>
<p><em>What kind of physical preparation do you have to do for your more action-heavy roles, like those in </em>Blade: The Series<em>, </em>Quantum of Solace<em> and </em>Push<em>?</em></p>
<p>I train a lot on an every day basis. My belief is that it is easier to stay ready than to get ready, so as long as I maintain a good physical fitness I am always prepared for whatever challenges a role may present. Then, for each individual role, I approach the necessities specific to that character. For <em>Blade</em>, the moment I got the role I started training with a teacher in samurai swords. There was no fight for my character in the scripts as yet, but I knew eventually Blade and Marcus would fight and I wanted to be prepared and to be Blade&#8217;s equal in combat. I worked every day with the sword for three months until it came [time] for the final battle scene. And when it came I was ready.</p>
<p><em>Your current role as Sasha Belov on ABC&#8217;s </em>Make It Or Break It<em> isn&#8217;t an action-heavy one, but is still centered around sport. Was your past as a gold-winning competitive boxer helpful in preparing for this character?</em></p>
<p>I think that having an athlete mentality has been really helpful for me as an actor in every sense. I prepare for roles and auditions in the same (psychological) way that I would for fights when I was boxing. Discipline, focus, commitment, hard work.</p>
<p><em>Do you have a preference between acting in television or film, or does it just depend on the role?</em></p>
<p>It all depends on the role, the project and the other people involved (director, producers, cast).</p>
<p><em>In the nineties, before you began acting professionally, you wrote your own musical. You returned to writing in 2006 and 2007, writing the screenplays for the films </em>The Passage<em> and </em>Star Crossed<em>. Are we going to see more writing from you in the future?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="8459" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/01/11/interview-with-neil-jackson/neil-jackson-3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg" data-orig-size="450,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="neil-jackson-3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=450" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" alt="Neil Jackson" title="neil-jackson-3" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8459" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/neil-jackson-3.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> I have been writing for eleven years now and, though the two films you mention are the first to be produced, I have three projects in development now and very much hope to see them get financing in the next calendar year.</p>
<p><em>Your London production company Paper Dragon Productions opened up American offices in Los Angeles just last year. What is the focus of the company?</em></p>
<p>The focus of the company is to make good films that we are passionate about and to facilitate creative artists to get their voice heard.</p>
<p><em>I noticed that Paper Dragon Productions was also involved in the launch of the new London Repertory Company. Is theater something that&#8217;s still close to your heart?</em></p>
<p>I was trained in theatre and my first jobs as an actor were in theatre. It is very close to my heart.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently acting in the second series of <em>Upstairs Downstairs</em> for the BBC.</p>
<p><em>Any &#8220;dream projects&#8221; that you&#8217;d love to do as an actor or writer, or as both?</em></p>
<p>Every project is a dream project.  Dreams change.</p>
