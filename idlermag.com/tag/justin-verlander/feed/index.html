										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something special is happening right now.</p>
<p>Alex Avila is flirting with. 300, the first Tigers catcher to hit so well since Lance Parrish. In fact, he took a turn at third base just to keep his offense in the lineup during interleague play. </p>
<p>If life were fair, he&#8217;d be the undeniable starting catcher for the American League at the All-Star Game. But life isn&#8217;t fair, and ignorant asshole Yankee fans are voting half their geriatric lineup into the game.</p>
<p>Obviously, some things never change.</p>
<p>Except for the things that do. </p>
<p>For once, the Twins and White Sox aren&#8217;t dominating the AL Central. For once, Ozzie Guillen&#8217;s brand of managerial jackassery isn&#8217;t paying dividends as his team hovers in the middle of the pack. For once, Joe Mauer isn&#8217;t the Tom Brady of baseball, wooing sportscasters with his impeccable hair and fundamentally, aesthetically perfect swing. He&#8217;s a catcher who&#8217;s already started to break down.</p>
<p>Leg weakness, the mystery injury that landed him on the DL for so much of the first half, might be an apt metaphor for what&#8217;s happened to the Twins and the Sox this season: something at the base is failing. </p>
<p>But the opposite is happening in Detroit. </p>
<p>Finally, the base is strong. Finally, Cabrera has protection in front of and behind him. Finally, the bottom of the lineup isn&#8217;t a three man barren wasteland of strikeouts and wasted at-bats. Finally, the Tigers arenâ€™t just about one man, one bat.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one man, however, who seems to personify the tigers this season: Justin Verlander. JV, like Steve Yzerman before him, adjusted his game to make his team better. Obviously, he can still mow &#8217;em down, but by pitching to contact he can go deeper into games &#8212; with multiple complete games already in the books this season, giving a thin bullpen adequate rest. </p>
<p>More than anything else, he is showing the team how to win: by putting the team ahead of your own stats; and in his case, that approach is netting a very special season.</p>
<p>So while the Tigers flirt with first, and Verlander winks at no-hitters every outing, and every man on the bench seems to have finally gotten it, it might feel a little bit like we&#8217;re living in bizarro world.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re not, fans. This is a brave new world, a world where the Tigers at the top is exactly how things are supposed to be.</p>
