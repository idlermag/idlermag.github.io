										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you read between the lines of my last few posts, you’ll notice that I haven’t really been cooking. Not only did I move from one ocean to the other, but I also started a glamorous new lifestyle &#8212; freelancing. By glamorous, I mean that it’s an effort to put on pants in the morning or to take showers or to sit somewhere other than my permanent assprint on the couch. With no one holding me accountable for needing to be anywhere at a certain time, I’m adrift. If I were organized and strict with myself, I could be my own best mother, but alas, I have no self-control and can easily waste an entire day without leaving the couch.</p>
<p>It seemed awesome, at first, but after hours and hours in front of a running slideshow of television reruns, emails, and my facebook news feed, I sometimes caught myself staring out the window with my mouth hanging open. I had lots of headaches. I felt sad and anxious and lazy as hell. I worried that my brain might actually be atrophying.</p>
<p>So I’ve been forcing myself into a schedule: get up early (even though I don’t actually have to), get dressed, get ready as if I’m leaving the house (even if I don’t end up actually doing so), make some effing coffee, and sit down to work. Turn off the computer for all meals. Go to the library or to a coffeeshop to work, where people will judge me if I’m sitting there in my underwear drooling in front of the computer. Work out. Cook dinner. Leave the computer off.</p>
<p>As a part of forcing myself to be a human being, I’ve been cooking lots of things I’m familiar with. Trying to get my shit together and getting to know a new city is stressful enough without having to try new vegetables. But I felt obligated to you, dear readers, and to my stomach, to try something new again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had this <a href="http://www.skinnytaste.com/2011/04/orecchiette-with-chicken-sausage-and.html" target="_blank">recipe</a> for orecchiette pasta (the little oval-shaped ones) with chicken sausage and broccoli rabe open on my computer for weeks, and finally decided to go for it, even though I have no idea what in the hell broccoli rabe actually is. (By the way, the <a href="http://www.skinnytaste.com" target="_blank">Skinny Taste</a> website is a great resource for tasty, healthy recipes. Highly recommended.) The ingredients are simple: pasta, chicken sausage, the broccoli rabe (?), chicken broth, parmesan cheese, garlic, and red pepper flakes. I knew I’d seen broccoli rabe at the grocery store (or at least, seen something bundled with a tag that read “broccoli rabe,”) but up until doing the research for this recipe I thought it was spelled like it’s pronounced: “broccoli robb.” Apparently not. Already a few negative points for this new vegetable.</p>
<p>At Safeway, I walked up and down the produce aisle at least five times, peeking in corners and smelling various things. I’d forgotten to google the vegetable beforehand, so I had no idea what I was looking for. I finally asked an employee, who thought I meant broccolini, and went to get the resident produce expert (who happened to be named Rob). For an expert, Rob really didn’t seem to know much of anything. He kept trying to push broccoli on me as if I’d somehow gotten confused and that regular broccoli was what I actually wanted. I left Safeway empty-handed.</p>
<p>It took two different trips to Whole Foods before I finally found the elusive vegetable. It turns out, broccoli rabe is not actually broccoli at all—it’s an Italian leafy vegetable called rapini, with little flowers that look like broccoli. Broccoli rabe is basically a nickname.</p>

<p>The recipe itself seemed simple—boil some water, blanch the rapini for a few minutes to help tone down its alleged bitterness, then cook the chicken sausage while the pasta boils.</p>

<p>Take the chicken sausage out of the pan, cook the garlic, then add everything back together, add the broth, parmesan, and red pepper flakes, and you’re done. After I do this a few more times, I’ll probably get better, but there were so many moving parts that I was throwing shit around, banging pots and pans, burning myself with boiling water, stirring in two pans at the same time, and generally losing my mind.</p>
<p>I realized right near the end that I didn’t actually have any red pepper flakes, but because I’m a classy broad and I save those little packets from Little Caesar’s, I had some packets of red pepper flakes in the cabinet. Once again, being cheap pays off.</p>

<p>The flavors in this were delicious &#8212; the chicken sausage we found at Whole Foods was great, and the red pepper and garlic gave it lots of flavor without making it too heavy. The only problem was the effing broccoli rabe. That stuff is disgusting. Even after blanching, it was really bitter. The spice of the red pepper helped to cut it a little, but not much. I looked over at Charlie, and saw that he’d eaten all the broccoli rabe first. TO GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. It was as if the broccoli rabe was the punishment we had to endure to get to the good parts of the dish. Next time, I’d probably make it with spinach. Rob the Produce Expert at Safeway was right &#8212; it probably would’ve been better with regular broccoli. Never again with the broccoli rabe.</p>
<p>When we heated up the leftovers to eat, Charlie said, “Would it offend you if I ate everything but the broccoli rabe?” No. No it would not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no surprise to any of you that I hate almost all vegetables. There are a select few that I actually enjoy (corn and potatoes), and others that I tolerate (broccoli, spinach, carrots, cucumber), but I hate all the rest. Even those that I tolerate are really just vehicles for ranch dressing or goat cheese and olive oil. I know vegetables are healthy and that (wo)man cannot live by fruit and bread alone, but I every time I force myself to choke down a bite of dry broccoli I feel like I’m punishing myself for some terrible wrongdoing.</p>

My immediate friends and family know, but despising vegetables is not something that makes you a welcome dinner guest or a great lunch partner, especially in a city with as many ethnic and offbeat food choices as Boston. In high school, one of my best friends was born in Romania, and her mother often cooked Romanian food at home. But because she knew I was picky, she’d relay a message through my friend days ahead to make sure whatever she was cooking was Jill-friendly. I hated feeling like such an asshole in someone else’s home.</p>
<p>As a result, I kept my feelings about vegetables to myself and became an accomplished scavenger, able to pick out all the onions and peas and still end up with a full meal. I always thought that this was a less rude solution than asking the cook to please, leave out the onions, mushrooms, peas, peppers,  and maybe all the vegetables while you’re at it, because I am picky and unable to handle it. But it occurred to me that leaving my host with a plate full of uneaten veggies is just as rude and probably disgusting.</p>
<p>So sometimes, I <em>will </em>eat the vegetables. I’ll eat the peas in the pot roast, closing my eyes and imagining that they’re just little rainbows. Once, at a pre-prom party, my friend’s mother had cooked us a fancy dinner, and the first course was a thick cheese soup. I picked up a chunk in the soup with my spoon, assuming it was a potato. But the bite had that horrible crunch and sweetness of an onion and my eyes started watering and I had to chew and chew and chew and try my hardest not to spit it out. It turned out it was actually an apple, but that’s how much I hate onions. My body’s reaction is to GET IT OUT. There’s a reason kids avoid vegetables unless they’re disguised as something else. There’s a reason they spit those peas out on the ground. Kids are not going to sugarcoat that shit. Vegetables are terrible.</p>
<p>However. I’m not a kid. I shouldn’t allow spinach to be my only green vegetable (I’m not allowed to count basil, right?). My mom is dealing with many newly acquired food allergies, and her doctor said that eating a lot of the same foods early in life can result in allergies later in life. How cruel is that, dear body? Developing allergies to the things you love to eat most? I love ice cream and flour too much to let that happen.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that while some of my opinions of vegetables are backed up by copious research and dry heaving, others are based on nothing whatsoever. I don’t think I’ve ever had Brussels sprouts, but they definitely look like something rabbits should ingest, not humans. The same goes for kale—something that bitter should be banished to the side of the plate with the sprig of parsley where it belongs. In trying to decide what to write about this week, one of my roommates started quizzing me about vegetables:  which I like, and which I refuse to eat. “You should do a vegetable challenge,” she said. Well then. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Once a week or so, I’ll try to put down that haterade and pick up a new vegetable. I’m going to try and find palatable recipes for veggie side dishes and if I survive that, I’ll move on to main dishes. This is not to say that I’m becoming a vegetarian—I love bacon way too much for that—but I’m shouldering the spear of asparagus and trying to keep my six-year-old self from stomping her feet too much.</p>
