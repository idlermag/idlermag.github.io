										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robin McKinley&#8217;s <em>Dragonhaven</em> is set in Smokehill National Park somewhere out west, where the major draw is a population of <em>Draco australiensis</em> &#8212;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop there.</p>
<p>I love this novel about a national park with dragons, which is also a meditation on parenting, communication, and memory. The premise alone was enough to sell me on this 2007 novel by the author of a dozen or so smart, humane, chatty fantasy novels, but I&#8217;ll give you a little more detail to explain why I love it so much.</p>
<p>Jake Mendoza is the teenage son of the director of the dragon studies institute at Smokehill, a chronically underfunded, understaffed dragon reserve. Almost no one sees the dragons on the millions of acres of parkland; Smokehill rangers track dragon population by counting the casualties among wild sheep, deer, and bison. Smokehill also has a very strange dragon-proof (and more importantly, poacher-proof) fence. Jake and his father are both devastated by the death of Jake&#8217;s mother three years before on a dragon study sabbatical in Kenya (the world&#8217;s only preserves for the endangered dragons are at Smokehill, in Kenya, and in Australia, to which dragons are native. The detail in <em>Dragonhaven</em> on the rediscovery and near-extinction of dragons and the politics of protecting enormous, flying, endangered species is right on.)</p>
<p>The following happens in the first 50 pages of the book, so don&#8217;t fear spoilers. Jake is belatedly allowed to do his first solo hike in the park and stumbles upon a dragon. It&#8217;s not just a dragon, which he has never seen up close before, but a dragon who has just given birth, which no one in the records has ever seen. And not only that, the dragon is dying, shot by a poacher. These are all unthinkably strange things, but Jake is focused only on the surviving baby dragon, who he saves and tries to raise, despite knowing &#8212; because of that complicated legislative picture &#8212; that it&#8217;s illegal to save the life of a dragon.</p>
<p>The relationship between Jake and Lois the baby dragon and the serious parenting crash course Jake has to undertake (what do you feed a baby dragon and how do you keep it from burning you? How can you do anything else when she needs feeding every half hour?) is compelling and all-consuming and feels true. The book is structured as a memoir Jake is writing to explain the events at Smokehill to a national audience, and he explains that he was so short of sleep while raising Lois that some of those years were a blur. Jake&#8217;s voice really does feel like a teenager&#8217;s voice and it sells you on the story and its required suspensions of disbelief because you trust that it happened the way Jake said it, even if he didn&#8217;t understand the larger political ramifications.</p>
<p>There are excellent small observations: because it seems absurd to Jake to say “Good dragon, Lois” like he was talking to a dog, he says “Hot stuff, Lois!” as a praise-phrase. And it&#8217;s exactly right that interspecies telepathy would cause terrible headaches.</p>
<p>If the book had a different cover I could see it being sold as a thrilling adventure novel, or as a touching book about parents and children. As it is, look for it in the young adult section of your bookstore or library.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons <em>Ender’s Game</em> is my favorite book is because you see how the adults are manipulating Ender, the main character who is six when the novel begins, and how he reacts to the new world they force upon him. Ender is smart. He adapts quickly and understands most of the manipulation going on around him. But he’s a child and most of all he wants friends and a happy family. His trust in the adults around him is sweet and humanizing. I love seeing the world from the point of view of a child in books for that reason. Their naiveté shows me how the world could look, how the world probably used to look to me, and it’s a good way to introduce new settings and characters.</p>
<p>I’m currently reading <em>The Good Thief</em> by Hannah Tinti. The main character, Ren, is about 12 years old. He has lived his entire life in an orphanage run by monks, so those 12 years haven’t given him a lot of worldly knowledge. When he is adopted by a man, Benjamin Nab, claiming to be his long lost older brother, Ren is ecstatic. He has been passed over by numerous other potential families because he is missing his left hand. Ren soon discovers that Benjamin is not his brother, in fact the man takes on a lot of roles. Whatever is necessary at the moment to get a room for the night or some food in their bellies, Benjamin will do. And Ren’s missing hand is a great selling point for all of the scams he plans to run.</p>
<p>I’m only about a third of the way into the book and already I want to reread it. The scene where Ren first comes to a large city is well written. He is seeing so many things for the first time that he has no idea how to put into context. The man with two women in the alley who are showing off their legs winks at Ren as he hands the women some money. The little knowledge he has of the world allows the author to make the mundane interesting again. I like when a child is the narrator or main character over a naïve adult. Adults should know better and when they don’t they are usually more aware of the feeling of embarrassment or shame at being unfamiliar with the world around them. Children can be embarrassed, but seem to enjoy the new world around them more.</p>
<p>Ren is taken in by two con men &#8212; Benjamin has a partner, Tom, who teaches Ren how to get money and lie. Ren was already a good thief &#8212; it was the only way to have something that was truly his at the orphanage &#8212; and he impresses the men with his sleight of hand. I treasure the moments when the young boy takes the men by surprise. After seeing him struggle and adapt, it’s nice to know Ren still excels in certain ways.</p>
<p>Young adult books appeal to me for the same reason. The main characters are seeing things for the first time and can often only put what they see into the context of the few things they already know. It gives authors a chance to show off narrative skills and make everything shiny and new. I prefer the sci fi young adult books to the coming of age/high school dramas because they give me a chance to encounter something new as well. It doesn’t really matter how well written meeting a cute boy or getting a first kiss is, I’ve done it and it’s going to take a lot to make me care. Since these books are meant for people who haven’t seen a lot of the world either they don’t always hit the same tone as books for adults with children as main characters.</p>
<p>I’m excited to see how much Ren grows and learns by the end of the book. Children lack the cynical attitude that can pull me out of a story. When they are excited and interested in their surroundings I find it easier to keep reading through a slow section. I need to find more well-written books with children leading the way. Any suggestions?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eva Ibbotson&#8217;s characters are haunted by the war. Which war? It depends on which romantic historical novel we&#8217;re talking about, but one thing&#8217;s for sure: neither her brave heroines nor her strong heroes can ever go back to Vienna.</p>
<p>Ibbotson (1925-2010), the beloved and bestselling author of chapter books for children such as <em>Which Witch?</em> and<em> J<em>o</em>urney to the River Sea</em>, also wrote a number of charming historical romances during the 1980s and 1990s, all recently reissued as YA. (Ibbotson wrote them for adults and was surprised at their popularity among YA audiences.) In each book, a headstrong heroine finds herself in an unfamiliar situation (for instance, the Russian countess, exiled after the Great War, who works as a servant in an English country house in <em>A Countess Below Stairs</em>) where she eventually charms everyone and finds love. The characters are immediately relatable, and their emotions are deeply felt.</p>
<p>Ibbotson and her family fled Vienna for London on the eve of World War II, and that flight colors these novels, where love always comes after struggle, and the happily ever afters are always bittersweet. It is the two world wars that shatter the illusion that St Petersburg (<em>A Countess Below Stairs</em>) and Vienna (<em>A Song for Summer, The Morning Gift</em>) will ever be the friendly, carefree places where her heroines grew up surrounded by love.</p>
<p>The books have flaws, of course. The villians are entirely too villainous: Rupert&#8217;s fiancee in <em>A Countess Below Stairs</em> is entirely hateful, a eugenicist who insults and mistreats the mentally disabled kitchen maid and the kind Jewish neighbors; and Harriet&#8217;s closeminded father in <em>A Company of Swans</em>, who refuses to let her dance in the ballet company (or matriculate at Cambridge, where he is a famous professor) is a one-note caricature of the kind of family one would run away to South America with a ballet company from.</p>
<p>There is always an idyll in these books, a sense that joy is too good to last. This is pronounced in <em>A Song For Summer</em>, where Ellen, the practical daughter of suffragettes who is unaccountably gifted at housekeeping, becomes the matron at an alternative school in Austria and transforms all the rich, eccentric students and teachers with her kindness and levelheadedness. Ellen falls in love with the school&#8217;s caretaker, a Czech concert violinist who has resigned his position in protest against the Reich. Everything is about to end. Ellen and Marek will find each other again after the war, changed. We, the readers, know that the beautiful valley, the children, the storks, the still lake, and Ellen and Marek cannot stay there forever. But how we wish they could.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year when the Pulitzer Prize winners were posted at work one sentence stood out from the rest. “No winner announced for fiction this year.”</p>
<p>Was fiction not outstanding this year? I’m sure that sometimes it’s difficult to pick a winner from a selection of books you aren’t impressed with, but doesn’t there <em>have</em> to be a winner? Can’t they just pick the best of the nominees? Also, who are “they”?</p>
<p>I was a little confused, mostly because I really have no idea how the Pulitzer Prize committee works. Each year the winners were announced and we put the fiction winner on display at the register. Then it’s over.</p>
<p>My first year working at the bookstore the fiction winner was <em>Tinkers </em>by Paul Harding. I had picked up the book a few months earlier in the new releases section of the library. The opening was moving and beautifully written. It isn’t a long book and I finished it that weekend. Learning that it later became a Pulitzer Prize winner was a nice boost to my book-choosing ego. Look at me go, I know a winner when I see one.</p>
<p>Looking at the list of past winners I saw a lot of books I recognized and a few I’ve read &#8212; <em>Interpreter of Maladies </em>by Jhumpa Lahiri (winner 2000), <em>Middlesex </em>by Jeffrey Eugenides (winner 2003), and <em>The Road </em>by Cormac McCarthy (winner 2007). I’d have to say <em>The Road</em> is my favorite. I had to put it down a few times and remind myself that I wasn’t cold and starving and fighting for my life. Then I usually made a sandwich, grabbed a blanket, and picked up where I left off.</p>
<p>Looking at the list of winners, and two runners up for each year, made me feel woefully under-read. It happens every time I see a list of “good” books. Part of me wants to read these books and improve myself while another (stronger) part of me rebels and reads Sophie Kinsella books for a week straight.</p>
<p>But this year there is no winner. The list of runners-up contains three books: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374281149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0374281149"><em>Train Dreams</em></a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Johnson">Denis Johnson</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307276686/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307276686"><em>Swamplandia!</em></a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Russell">Karen Russell</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316074225/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wordwright0a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316074225"><em>The Pale King</em></a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>. I’d have to say <em>The Pale King </em>is the one I’ve wanted to read the most. I’d heard great things about <em>Swamplandia!</em> and nothing (sorry) about <em>Train Dreams</em>.</p>
<p>My reaction to the news matched the reaction of the coworkers I spoke with: If no winner is picked it means no one is good enough. Then one coworker learned <em>Swanpalndia!</em> was a nominee and was shocked. He had loved the book and if it wasn’t good enough then what was? How did this process work anyway?</p>
<p>Well, this year a three-person fiction jury read 314 books and sent their three nominees to the Pulitzer Prize Board. That 20-person board then chooses the winner over a span of two days. Because they choose winners from nominees in 21 categories, I really wonder if they read everything. I would be hard-pressed to read three novels in two days and decide which is best. Couple that with choosing a winner for History, Drama, Biography, General Nonfiction, Music, Poetry, and 14 journalism categories and I’m out.</p>
<p>No matter how much the board actually knows about the nominees, I know a winner has to be chosen by a majority vote. I like to think that each member felt so strongly about the novel they liked that none of them were willing to compromise and let another book win. That I would understand. I know how to be stubborn and dig in my heels. Although this is the first time in 35 years that no fiction prize has been awarded, it has happened ten other times.</p>
<p>What does it mean to not award this prize, which normally has a bigger impact than any other prize on American sales? I feel like no matter what you say about the process or how the books were “unorthodox” as some have said, this makes the fiction of 2011 look weak. People depend on the Pulitzer to determine the best. Whether that is a good thing or not is moot. If it’s your job to pick a winner then you pick a winner.</p>
<p>I don’t think <em>The Pale King </em>should win just because David Foster Wallace had a beautiful career. If people want to give him a lifetime achievement award I’m fully behind it, but that’s not what the Pulitzer is. Was the board afraid that’s what the public would think if it gave an unfinished novel the prize? Wallace&#8217;s editor pieced together the ending from manuscripts and some people have said it shows in the flow of the writing. I’m glad it was published but it’s okay if it’s not a winner on its own merits. It’s okay, too, if it is.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> cited Karen Russell’s young age, 29 when <em>Swamplandia!</em> was first published, as her “unorthodox” qualification. It’s also her first book, neither of which should be held against her. <em>Tinkers</em> was Paul Harding’s first book and while I hate them both for publishing at a young age, the books are good. Isn’t it more impressive to do so well your first time and at such a young age?</p>
<p><em>Train Dreams</em> by Denis Johnson was originally a novella, first published in the Paris Review and then years later published as a hardcover. I know it’s less traditional than the 300 to 800 page books we see a lot of, but it’s a good thing when an author knows where to end a story.</p>
<p>Fiction is changing. Collections of short stories and long, full-length novels aren’t necessarily going anywhere, but they are sharing the shelves with lyric stories and books that use images as much as they use words. This is good. In an age of ebooks and Amazon, when fiction is at everyone’s fingertips it’s time to change the game a little. Show people something new and clever, something bold that doesn’t fit into preconceived notions of story.  Shock them and get them talking and reading even more.</p>
<p>And if it’s your job to say what’s the best, do it. If all three nominees are unconventional, doesn’t that say something about the changing face of fiction writing? Maybe it says something about the stodginess of the panel too. Hopefully next year something will change. I hope it’s the Pulitzer Prize Board because I like where fiction is headed.</p>
