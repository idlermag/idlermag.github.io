										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was growing up, my dad spoke fondly about the time in his life when he reread his favorite book, <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, once a year. “On an exceptionally hot evening in July,” he would quote in a funny voice, imitating a friend who didn&#8217;t get his love for the book, “a young man came out of his garret on S Place and walked slowly toward K Bridge&#8211;what is this stuff?” But during the 1970s, he made a point of reading the book every year.</p>

It&#8217;s <em>Little, Big</em>, by John Crowley, a sprawling fantasy family saga. Sometime during the summer, some hot and languorous week, I have a strong sense that it&#8217;s time. I drop the five other books I&#8217;m in the middle of, find a place to read and a bowl of apples, and return to the story. I haven&#8217;t memorized the first line like my dad did with his book, but <em>Little, Big</em> starts with Smoky Barnable walking from the City to the house called Edgewood to get married. Alice (called Daily Alice) Drinkwater is waiting. She takes a bath in Edgewood&#8217;s Gothic Bathroom, with stained glass and a stone tub (this is an indelible image for me). And the story goes inward and outward.</p>
<p><em>Little, Big</em> is subtitled, in the style of Victorian novels, <em>The Fairies&#8217; Parliament, </em>and it is indeed an exploration of the sympathetic magic between world and person, Word and utterance, wood and bird. The family story of the Drinkwaters is implicated in a magico-political rebuilding of America. A heartbroken young man builds a memory palace. Alice&#8217;s great-uncle photographs fairies in the bottom of the garden. Edgewood&#8217;s rusty orrery grinds back to orbit. The title reminds you to be attentive to the echoes of “as above, so below” throughout Smoky and Alice&#8217;s family story.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised, really, that I can&#8217;t recite the first line, because while the book&#8217;s language is beautiful, lyrical, and deliberate, I experience it after so many rereads as a sequence of dream images. When I reread <em>Little, Big</em> I fall back into them. I read for the images I can&#8217;t forget &#8212; and for unremembered images so vivid I&#8217;m amazed I could forget them. Every time I reread I&#8217;m struck by an incident involving a changeling that I find so terrifying that I block it out, just like the characters do. The structure is cyclical, too, so that I know that the story will turn back, like the paths in the private walled garden in the novel. I haven&#8217;t reread <em>Little, Big </em>yet this summer, but soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a certain day in June, 19&#8211;, a young man was making his way on foot northward from the great City to a town or place called Edgewood, that he had been told of but had never visited. His name was Smoky Barnable, and he was going to Edgewood to get married; the fact that he walked but did not ride was one of the conditions placed on his coming there at all.</p></blockquote>
