										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can’t pause the game because &#8220;Start&#8221; on my Sega Genesis controller is for blocking. </p>
<p>Instead, I jump around from one side of the screen to the other, hoping that I don’t jump on a fireball or impeccably-placed uppercut from the AI-controlled Johnny Cage as my dad passes through the room. I contemplate resetting the game, but I’ve already been playing for thirty minutes out of the hour I’m allotted on school days, and it would take another twenty or so to get this far on the tournament tree. Besides, I&#8217;ve only been able to successfully perform Sub-Zero’s fatality two out of five attempts as I have not quite mastered the timing on the inputs. The round timer is ticking down, and a TIME UP is a cheesy way to win. Besides, that would not provide an opportunity to perform a FATALITY! </p>
<p>Dad sits on the sofa, interested in evaluating the impact of his purchase, which means confirming if I am satisfied. He had gone to Wal-Mart the previous day to acquire the newly-released <em>Street Fighter II: Championship Edition</em>, which was a pretty big deal for Sega in those days as Nintendo had enjoyed a year of exclusivity of the now-legendary <em>Street Fighter II</em> on the Super Nintendo (Entertainment System). This new version of the game made bosses playable and Mirror Matches possible without a Game Genie. Unfortunately, dad got off from work at 5, and by the time he made it across town to our local store, they were sold out. So he picked up the newly-released <em>Mortal Kombat</em> instead, Capcom&#8217;s new rival franchise, thinking that its MA-13 rating was the equivalent of SFII:CE’s. </p>
<p>I cringe, knowing that the Genesis version of <em>Mortal Kombat</em> has a distinct advantage over its SNES counterpart that would go down in infamy:</p>
<p>A, B, A, C, A, B, B </p>
<p>Followed by a screen of text that nobody has ever read more than once and Scorpion&#8217;s &#8220;GET OVER HERE!&#8221; command,</p>
<p>With precision, I perform what would become a staple combo, freezing ice in the famous SF cast via the classic SF “fireball” motion followed by an uppercut and a slide whose inputs required me to release the controller with my right hand and use my thumb and middle-finger to hit the A and C buttons simultaneously with my index finger on the start button, and return my hand to its normal position &#8212; a technique of controller manipulation I would use in many, many fighting games such as <em>Tekken</em> and <em>Soul Calibur</em> for years to come. </p>
<p>“FINISH HIM!” the game demands of me. I grant its request.</p>
<p>F, D, F, A at close range rewards the innocent witness that is my father and me with a darkening background and menacing jingle as Sub-Zero stops halfway into his uppercut animation to remove poor Johnny’s head from his shoulders, blood dripping, spine attached, and raises his newfound trophy in a victory pose reminiscent of your favorite medieval (or if you’re like me, Sengoku-era Japan) film where the enemy general has been decapitated and his army surrenders in morale shock. </p>

<p>“Humph!” my father laughs nervously, “You sure you’re supposed to be playing this?” he asks incredulously, but no real threat. </p>
<p>I am ten years old at the time in 1993. “Yes, dad, I can handle it. I know I’m not supposed to do this to anyone in real life.&#8221; I say this in as a sort of plea, unaware that I wouldn’t even watch my first rated-R movie that didn’t have commercials to cut out all the “bad parts” until I was old enough to drive myself to the movies and buy the damned ticket myself. </p>
<p>Content, perhaps not by my answer, but rather by the fact that his son was making way into manhood for the first time, discovering that violence exists in the real world, and it can be filtered through a virtual environment, my dad left me to my hobby. &#8220;Well, as long as you know that it&#8217;s just a game&#8221; he would offer as <em>conditional</em> approval. </p>
<p>I would witness <em>Mortal Kombat</em> become a trailblazer in the games industry. Alongside <em>Night Trap</em>, which enjoyed a brief moment in the spotlight, and the <em>Doom</em> franchise that would follow a different trajectory than console-based games, gamers would experience revisions to the games rating system, and the emergent discourse known as &#8220;Video Game Violence&#8221; (VGV).  </p>
<p>Ah, yes! You might be old enough to remember those days when the local or national news would continue to show clips of the games I have mentioned above even decades after their popularity had waned.  If there was a more discrete indication of a disconnect between older audiences and younger generations (of gamers), it would be talking about VGV while showing scenes from the now-pixilated <em>Doom II</em> while gamers are playing <em>Soldier of Fortune</em>, a game whose engine was specifically designed to maim enemies as thoroughly as possible, even after death.  </p>
<p>But I am getting ahead of myself. That&#8217;s the kind of game content that I feel goes too far, and that&#8217;s Part 2 of this piece. I would like to go back to games like <em>MK2</em>, which was one of the most highly-anticipated games of its day, and is the first game I remember going to the arcade (do those even exist anymore beyond Dave &amp; Buster&#8217;s?) and learning to place a coin on the dashboard of the machine to indicate &#8220;I got next.&#8221; <em>MK2</em> was <em>FREAKING COOL</em> just by virtue of how Midway continued to consciously contrast the SF franchise, preferring real-life actors in costume with Wrath of the Titans-style stop motion video capture. Furthermore, even with the hyper-violence of the new fatalities, such as torso tearing and arm ripping, the game demonstrated an ironic meta-awareness of itself. I&#8217;m not just talking about the added Friendships or Babalities as non-violent alternatives to what made the franchise famous, but the gratuitous increase of blood and gore rendered the game as comical as serious. Scorpion&#8217;s &#8220;GET OVER HERE&#8221; spear in <em>MK1</em> resulted in a few drips upon contact. <em>MK2</em>&#8216;s version results in wide-spray water hose effect. High Punches now make the blood splash to the floor in ways reminiscent to Sub-Zero&#8217;s <em>MK1</em> fatality, a dramatic change from the first game&#8217;s mist evaporating in mid-air for the same move. Lastly, some fatalities are simply ridiculous, such as Raiden&#8217;s, my favorite character. Both of his fatalities cause his opponents to explode into gibs (gamerspeak for hard-to-identify body parts), which would be cool, except that oftentimes, gamers can count sometimes too many body parts in the pile!</p>

<p><em>MK2</em> was innovative in many ways, but the exaggerated violence bordered crass in others. </p>

Though <em>Primal Rage</em> only earned a TEEN rating, this shot was quite the, yes, RAGE among &#8220;concerned parents.&#8221; (Read: Media bringing this to the attention of the otherwise oblivious)</p>
<p>This, I think, was the beginning of when &#8220;mature&#8221; content in games began to go wrong as soon as it started.  <em>MK2</em>, by the way, was among the first mainstream games to earn the &#8220;MA-17&#8221; rating by the ESRB. </p>
<p>Beyond the <em>MK</em> franchise, with rare exceptions such as <em>Robocop vs The Terminator</em> on the Sega Genesis, <em>Lethal Enforcers</em>, or <em>Snatcher</em>, VGV on 16-bit consoles was often limited. However, I distinctly remember in the ensuing 32-bit era, <em>Resident Evil</em> for the PS1, where I could shoot a zombie in the head at point-blank with a shotgun, and it would still walk toward me headless for three seconds, blood shooting in the air anime-style, before dying, where a dead zombie was &#8220;marked&#8221; to the player by a pool of blood around the corpse. I emphasize <em>marked</em> because a convention in the pre-<em>RE4</em> days was to have a live zombie APPEAR dead, then scare the gamer by having the zombie grab and chomp on the player&#8217;s leg. The only way to confirm a dead zombie on-screen was the blood pool or no zombies at all. </p>
<p>Rockstar, as celebrated as it is infamous for pushing the boundaries of game content, would port over their flagship franchise <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> the PC to consoles(You can get <em>GTA 1</em> and <em>2</em> for <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/classics/?id=1" target="_blank">FREE</a> by the way) with the pinnacle of its reputation not being <a href="http://youtu.be/yCwi0WBWlHk?t=10m12s" target="_blank">an arbitrary naked male scene</a> in its <em>GTA4</em> expansion &#8220;The Lost and the Damned,&#8221; but a poorly-designed mini-game that was scrapped at the last minute but was discovered by datamining modders, now known as “Hot Coffee,” where the player could control the protagonist having sex with his various girlfriends. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how far video games have come from the <em>MK</em> days. But then again, disturbing in others. far we Hot Coffee ain’t got *** on <em>God of War III</em>, where Kratos has off-screen sex with the goddess Aphrodite, as her buxom, buck-naked, suggestively bisexual concubines watch with eager anticipation and react to the player’s mastery of the on-screen button prompts. In the opposite direction, we have chainsaws on guns in games like <em>Gears of War</em>, and F-bomb marathons in <em>The House of the Dead: Overkill</em> for the Wii. </p>
<p>So it would seem that alongside the &#8220;nerds&#8221; who played video games in the mid to late-80&#8217;s through the 90&#8217;s, over time video games would evolve from something that just nerdy types would be interested into a medium demanding at times to be taken as seriously as we do Hollywood movies (so we&#8217;re not starting with arbitrary dates here, the post-video game crash and the emergence of Nintendo and the NES is where I would start when talking about from where the current video game industry has evolved). After all, we gamers have grown up, and our aesthetic palate would mature with us, right? </p>
<p>RIGHT???</p>
<p>I am not so sure. In my next piece, I would like to address this question of &#8220;mature&#8221; gaming that had emerged more poignantly than ever in this past generation, and how the division between &#8220;casual&#8221; and &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gaming alienated and solidified key sectors in the gaming industry. Like the fatalities of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, it gets messy, folks. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think my <em>Idler</em> editor might have my number. He has somehow tapped into my love for getting really worked up about issues, researching them, and then raging against them on the Internet. I believe this is a flaw I am to be loved for and not merely in spite of. So as to not get unfriended on the regular, I try to limit my rants (and wearing my hair in a ponytail) to once a week. So movie ratings, it looks like today is your day.</p>
<p>When my editor suggested writing about filmmaker Tony Comstock’s latest undertaking the<em> Boi Meets Girl Meets the MPAA</em> project, I thought, “Sure, I could absolutely explore how much I hate the flawed film ratings, if only I knew a little more about them.” Luckily for me, <a href="http://www.tonycomstock.com/">Tony Comstock</a> does.  Comstock plans to submit the unedited director’s cut of his film <em>Brett and Melanie: Boi Meets Girl</em> to the Motion Picture Association of America. On the basis of the MPAA’s feedback, Comstock will develop a multi-angle DVD showing the exact differences between the versions of the film including Unrated, NC-17, R and PG-13. According to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1028624277/brett-and-melanie-boi-meets-girl-meets-the-mpaa" target="new">its Kickstarter page</a>, <em>Brett and Melanie</em> will attempt to ascertain how lesbian sexuality is interpreted by mainstream content ratings systems.</p>
<p><em>Brett and Melanie</em> is the seventh installment of Comstock’s <em><a href="http://www.comstockfilms.com/" target="new">Real People, Real Life, Real Sex</a></em> documentary series. It’s important to recognize that this film is not an anti-MPAA stunt, nor is it some sort of prank. This film is attempting to explore the “problematic place of explicit sexuality in cinema.” Furthermore, the film documents the relationship of a butch/femme lesbian couple and is thus engineered to also explore how content rating systems interpret lesbian sexuality and its level of offensiveness to mainstream America.  In my experience, realistic lesbian sexuality is found to be horrendously offensive. As a rule, homosexual sex scenes have been treated by a much different set of rules by the MPAA than similar heterosexual sex scenes. However, heterosexualized or fetishisized lesbian sexuality (think cheerleaders and threesomes) is absolutely acceptable in our theaters and living rooms.</p>
<p>There are a few misconceptions <a href="http://www.tonycomstock.com/2011/03/16/what-andrew-sullivan-doesnt-understand-about-the-mpaa/" target="new">Comstock seeks to clarify about the MPAA</a>. First, there is no requirement that any film in the United States be submitted to the MPAA or any other body for a rating. Second, as Comstock states, the NC17 rating, which replaced the X rating, is an adults-only rating—there is no difference between what content can be in an NC17 film and what can appear on an unrated DVD.</p>

<p>Roger Ebert (one of the infamous two thumbs) <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703766704576009343432436296.html" target="new">is vocal in his opposition to the MPAA ratings</a>, arguing that the ratings place too much emphasis on sex while approving more readily gratuitous amounts of horrific violence. This might very well be the only thing Roger and I have ever agreed on. Another primary argument in opposition to the MPAA rating system points out that films released by major studios are treated more favorably and given more lenient ratings than those submitted by independent outfits.</p>
<p>A final argument points out that while the MPAA claims to be a ratings <em>system</em>, it is hardly systematic. The ratings follow very few hard-and-fast rules and are instead quite subjective, hinging on the sensibilities of those giving the rating. For example look at the recent overturning of the NC17 rating given to <em>Blue Valentine</em>. The film, now rated R, was not forced to revise any content after it successfully lobbied against the adults only rating.</p>
<p>The MPAA considers many factors when rating a film including sex, violence, nudity, language, and drug use. However, the body doesn’t release any specific guidelines as to what content will garner which rating. This often makes submitting a film for rating a bit of a crapshoot and is exactly the issue the <em>Boi Meets Girl Meets the MPAA</em> project is hoping to explore. By submitting the film for rating and following suggestions of the MPAA for what content must be cut out to receive which rating, Comstock hopes the get a better grasp on exact differences between the ratings.</p>
<p>So what’s so bad about the NC17 rating, you might ask? Mainly the conception of this rating in the minds of most people. According to Comstock, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/02/1968-75-how-x-rated-became-synonymous-with-porn/70655/" target="new">because NC17 replaced the X rating, it largely inherited the X rating&#8217;s association with pornography.</a> Also, NC17 films are not given wide advertisement, many papers refuse to publicize these films and trailers are not screened. Many mainstream movie theater chains like AMC and Lowe’s refuse to screen NC17 films, meaning audiences without access to an “art house” theater will not get a chance to watch the film before its DVD release. Many movie rental chains also do not stock films with an NC17 rating.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note, that unlike many countries (the UK included), who have government-run film screening bodies with severe punishment including jail time associated with distribution of “offensive” films, ratings in the United States carry no such legal penalties. There are no laws restricting distribution of films not submitted to the MPAA to be rated. Unrated films are simply labeled NR, instead of being censored by a government authority. However, major movie studios have agreements with the MPAA to submit all of their films for ratings. And films with an NR label are definitely not being screened alongside the afternoon showing of <em>Bambi: Resurrected</em>.</p>

<p>The R-rated <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em> gave me nightmares for weeks. Any time the line about the lotion is quoted I shudder. <em>The Accused</em>, also rated R (clearly Jodi Foster seems to be the source of many of my nightmares), depicts the gang rape of the protagonist on a seedy bar’s pinball machine. Meanwhile <em>Henry &amp; June</em> got the dreaded NC17. Ask any fourteen-year-old what they prefer, nightmares or sex dreams? Ask yourself.  A sort of post-fall logic that sees pleasure and sexuality as a threat to the fabric of society seems to be in action here.</p>
<p>What kills more people annually, a little light bondage or deranged serial killers? (Don&#8217;t answer that. I understand that a lot of people in hotel rooms have been giving ropes and handcuffs a bad reputation these past few years.) The point is that one of these two has the intent to end in pleasure for all involved. Why is it that images of violence against women are more acceptable than a consenting sex scene?</p>
<p>I believe that any effort to explain the rating system and why certain content earns a restrictive rating while other (arguably more offensive) content is approved is worth supporting. Tony Comstock’s <em>Brett and Melanie: Boi Meets Girl Meets the MPAA</em> project seeks to do just that.  Wouldn’t it be nice to live in a world that views sex as healthy and not somehow on the same level as graphic depictions murder? Or if tolerance was promoted by depicting homosexual relationships as valid and healthy instead of as more offensive than cannibalism? Maybe if our kids watched James Franco don a condom they would be more apt to use one themselves.</p>
<p><em>Tony Comstock&#8217;s </em>Brett and Melanie: Boi Meets Girl Meets the MPAA<em> is currently seeking support through <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1028624277/brett-and-melanie-boi-meets-girl-meets-the-mpaa" target="new">Kickstarter</a>. The deadline to become a supporter is Monday May 9.</em></p>
