										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I taken more stabs at this <a href="http://starmen.net/mother2/" target="_blank">Earthbound/Mother 2</a> than I care to admit and each time I ended up the one murdered. Heaven knows it isn’t the weirdness. I&#8217;ve spent the better part of my life in weirdness, much of which happens to be Japanese. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL" target="_blank">FLCL</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy" target="_blank">The Tatami Galaxy</a>, both coming-of-age, fourth-wall breaking, culturally referential, magically real anime. These series are best watched rather than explained since they are arguably highest form of the modern Japanese narrative aesthetic and <em>EarthBound</em>, though made earlier, certainly plays in the same sandbox.</p>
<p>Example: In the first hour I encounter a dog who becomes possessed by a game designer in order to give me a mini-tutorial on the game&#8217;s item menu system and, upon completion, the dog returns to its normal barking.</p>

<p>So, if the game world is delightful that really only leaves the design. Early game is brutal. You can only save at telephones, black phones are free, green are pay. In the first the area is a black telephone at your parents which is very far from all the action in town or you can pay in town. Now, that’s not so bad, but healing items, like burgers and fries, are expensive and most of the enemies whollop you hard, so money is horded simply to afford better armor and items. This makes using pay phones ineffient unless you are VERY far away. Enemies, however, also respawn every time you leave an area, so you often also need to fight your way back to phone, pay or not.</p>
<p>And THAT, my friends, is a recipe for lost progress.</p>
<p>Now, don’t hear what I am not saying. I am a fellow who loves a challenge, but I play games to enjoy myself not experience nerd rage.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, emulator save states for the win.</p>

<p>This game doesn’t mess around.</p>
<p>You are thrown right into the action.  There isn’t a lengthy prologue intro like some other games (*cough* <em>Zelda</em> *cough*).  Our hero, Cloud, jumps off a train and starts fights with Shinra guards.  Bam.  Let’s go.</p>
<p>It reminds of a storytelling technique: “Start the story as late as possible,” also known as <em>in medias res</em>.  We don’t need to see Cloud meeting Barret and talking about the plan, nor do we need to see them boarding the train in the first place.</p>
<p>Dropping the player into a fast-paced action scene first thing in the game is a great way to lure them in&mdash;what do I do?  Where am I going?  What will happen next?</p>
<p>Look at the opening of the film <em>The Dark Knight</em> as a comparison:</p>
<p>It starts with the bank robbers breaking into the bank, not with them planning it out or preparing.  It sets the tone and allows for character development via their actions within the intense scene (in this case, the Joker’s cunning and ruthlessness).</p>
<p><strong>What do we learn in the opening minutes of <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Barret has no problem blowing up a huge reactor in the middle of a crowded city.  Cloud is an elite fighter-for-hire who could care less about Barret’s political and environmental beliefs.  Barret is dedicated to his cause and for him, the ends justify the bloody means.  Cloud has no qualms against selling his services to such a man.  In-<em>tense</em>.</p>
<p>And in 1997 they had no problem using the word “terrorist” in the game.  And that’s what Barret is&mdash;an eco-terrorist.  He’s blowing up mako reactors (which leads to death of innocents) to send a message to Shinra.</p>
<p>What I also liked is that there wasn’t a twenty-minute tutorial on how to play the game before you get to start playing.  This is something I’ve noticed more and more in recent games&mdash;they show you how to play before you can do anything.</p>
<p>C’mon. I just wanna play.</p>
<p>I decided to keep all of my character names at their defaults, but my follow FFVII blogger Andrew <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/23/ffvii/">has a great set of naming rules</a>.</p>
<p>The level design of this game still blows me away, and now that I’m older I get some of the visual references.  I see a lot of influence from the 1927 film <em>Metropolis</em> in the layout of Midgar, namely the “rich” city above ground with the slums below (as well as the city relying on dangerous machines for power).</p>
<p>Man, I love that I can just hold down the OK button to auto-select FIGHT in battles.  It speeds things up considerably.</p>
<p><strong>On Level Building:</strong></p>
<p>I’m the kind of player who will spend a day or so getting into random encounters to level up early in a RPG.  Sure, it can be boring at times&mdash;but it tends to save me a few headaches later on when I can beat baddies with ease.  Plus, it helps pad the wallet and levels up materia faster.</p>
<p>After the reactor explosion, Barret wants to blow up a <em>second</em>.  This guy is nuts.  But, he is also a devoted father, which we learn post-explosion back in the slums.  He’s one complex dude.</p>
<p>We also meet the first part of Cloud’s eventual love triangle, Tifa.</p>
<p>Oh, Tifa.  A badass fighter woman with uh. . . ”huge tracks of land.”  What more could a sixteen-year-old boy hope for in a video game in the 1990s?</p>
<p>Before heading out for the second terrorist attack, I did a bit of level-building in the train grave yard.  I also earned enough gil to equip each of my characters (Cloud, Barret and Tifa) with Restore materia.  I’ve played way more <em>Final Fantasy</em> games since I last played <em>VII</em>, so I know that being able to heal is a good thing.</p>
<p>After the second reactor explosion, we meet the rest of the love triangle, Aeris.  Two women fighting over Cloud?  This was like crack to a sixteen-year-old boy, I tell ya.  Years later, it still makes for great story telling.</p>
<p>I forgot how much I loved the music for this game too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Andrew, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/23/ffvii/">Don Corneo picked me</a>, so I’ve made a good start.</p>
<p>I’m also officially now into uncharted territory: my first attempt at playing through <em>FFVII</em> ended when I couldn’t quite figure out how to pull together the cross-dressing mission in the Wall Market area. I’m a bit embarrassed that by my current game’s clock, this means that I was less than three hours into the game before I gave up on it, but, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/23/final-fantasy-vii-again-for-the-first-time/">like I said</a>, I had an infant and a crappy job. Now I have a preschooler, a first-grader, and a perfectly sane job, so onward!</p>
<p>I’m somewhat pleased to find that one of my primary complaints from my first playthrough is greatly diminished this time around: I’m finding it a lot less difficult to tell what’s a door and what’s not.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2816" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2816" data-attachment-id="2816" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/06/navigating-the-third-dimension/cloud_strife/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cloud_strife.jpg" data-orig-size="200,240" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Cloud_Strife" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cloud_strife.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cloud_strife.jpg?w=200" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cloud_strife.jpg?w=640" alt="Cloud" title="Cloud_Strife"   class="size-full wp-image-2816" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cloud_strife.jpg 200w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cloud_strife.jpg?w=125 125w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2816" class="wp-caption-text">Cloud Strife, protagonist of <em>FFVII</em>, whose appearance is not entirely dissimilar to. . .</p></div> Having been spoiled by the graphical riches of the recent <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, and being well-versed in the earlier two-dimensional games, it’s fascinating to me to play <em>VII</em> as being able to watch the game’s developers figure out how to make a three-dimensional title work. In a world as murky and monotone as the slums under Midgar, it’s a real challenge at times to simply read the game’s visual cues. It’s not always immediately apparent what’s a walkable pathway and what’s not, especially in areas where you have pathways at different levels on the same screen and you have to figure out (often, for me, through simple trial-and-error) which bit of debris is meant to allow Cloud to move from a lower level to a higher and vice-versa.</p>
<p>And it’s entirely possible that on my first playthrough I simply missed the way that lighting is used to clue you in to where you’re supposed to go next. The fact that light (often but not always green) spills out from buildings you can enter and corners that lead to new screens is an elegant solution, but apparently just a bit too subtle for my former sleep-deprived self.</p>
<p>Before you judge me too harshly, let me note that my point of comparison was the bright, gorgeous, and colorful <em>FFX</em>, which does a brilliant job of largely covering the fact that it’s impossible to get lost because 80% of the time there’s only one direction you can go.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2817" style="width: 180px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2817" data-attachment-id="2817" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/06/navigating-the-third-dimension/tidus/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tidus.png" data-orig-size="200,351" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Tidus" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tidus.png?w=171" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tidus.png?w=200" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/tidus.png?w=170&#038;h=300" alt="Tidus" title="Tidus" width="170" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-2817" /><p id="caption-attachment-2817" class="wp-caption-text">. . . Tidus, the protagonist of <em>FFX</em>. Slightly less spiky. Slightly more colorful. Same big sword.</p></div> Which does lead me to my last observation for the week, which will finally (finally!) let me talk just a bit about <em>FFVII</em>’s story.  While I don’t want to give the impression that I like <em>FFX</em>’s colorful design better than the muted, industrial tones that dominate <em>FFVII</em> so far&mdash;I love me some dark, machine-noir design, after all&mdash;I do have to say that in <em>FFX</em> the <em>Final Fantasy</em> team did a better job of using story to make sense of the player’s unavoidable initial unfamiliarity with the world they’re asked to navigate.</p>
<p>That is to say, it’s a bit frustrating to feel lost in <em>FFVII</em>. The player character, Cloud, is supposed to be something of an expert in his world. He’s been an elite SOLDIER&mdash;on a different level from his AVALANCHE compatriots&mdash;who should be familiar with upper-status areas of Midgar, but having spent his childhood in the slums (with Tifa), he should be reasonably familiar with those areas as well. In some sense, he (I) shouldn’t need to be led around between the Sector 5 and Sector 7 slums by Aeris. <em>I</em> need to be led around, sometimes even more than the game seems to already do, but Cloud should be a bit more, well, self-sufficient.</p>
<p>By contrast, in <em>FFX</em> the player character, Tidus, is thrown along with the player into an entirely unfamiliar world, which has an undeniable but entirely unclear connection to the world Tidus knew. Tidus starts out as a hanger-on to a group of much more worldly characters with their own clear purpose. It provides a structure for the game to offer a great deal of otherwise basic information to the player in a way that feels an organic extension of both the story and the gameplay.</p>
<p>In <em>FFVII</em> right now, I’m in the train graveyard. I think. Which would actually be good, because it would mean that I could do some grinding and tell myself that I’m catching up with Daniel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve long considered myself a big <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan, but for someone who talks about the series so much, I’ve always considered it something of a shameful secret that I’ve never played more than a couple of hours of the game that many people consider to be the greatest RPG of all time, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>.</p>
<p>I played the original <em>Final Fantasy</em> as a kid on an old 8-bit NES, but never owned a Super Nintendo, so if pushed I would have to admit that for a long time I preferred the competing <em>Dragon Warrior</em> series (now known as the <em>Dragon Quest</em> series). There were four <em>Dragon Warrior</em> games released for the NES, and I played through at least two of them (which wasn’t bad for a 10-year-old). While it’s common knowledge now that there were three <em>Final Fantasy</em> games for the NES in Japan, only the first one made it to the US, and it was really long, pretty hard, and compared to the original <em>Dragon Warrior</em>, kind of dull. Sure <em>Final Fantasy</em> gave you four playable characters to <em>Dragon Warrior</em>’s one, and even better, you could choose between warriors, fighters, thieves, and mages, but in <em>Dragon Warrior</em>, the princess had the hots for me, and even though I could only fight one monster at a time, they just looked cooler than the bad guys in <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy II</em> (which was actually the fourth game in the series, if the Japanese games were included) changed all this. It was a revelation. The graphics and music blew my mind, but even better, I was playing actual characters with actual stories. Palom and Porom are still my all-time favorite <em>FF</em> characters. I would buy a Palom and Porom game. (You hear me, Squre Enix? Get on it!)</p>
<p>For all that, this was right about where I dropped out of console gaming. I’m not sure I even knew at the time that there was a third game released in the US. I came back in when I played <em>Final Fantasy X</em> on my roommate’s PS2 in 2002. It’s still my favorite game of the series.</p>
<p>I picked up <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> back in 2004, when the store where I worked was having a clearance sale on Playstation games. I plugged it into my brother’s PS2 and played for a couple of hours, but didn’t make it very far. My wife, infant daughter, and I were living with my parents at the time. I was working a lot of nights. I didn’t have a lot of free time, and the game, well, looked kind of muddy after the gorgeous PS2 and GameCube games I had been playing. When my family moved out on our own, we took my GameCube but not the PS2, so <em>FFVII</em> went back on the shelf.</p>
<p>So I’m really excited to plug my <em>FFVII</em> disc into my PS3 and give it another go. I’m looking at the game with fresh eyes as much as I can, but don’t worry too much about spoilers&mdash;I’m a strategy guide kind of guy, I’ll admit, and I do already know what happens to Aerith (is it possible not to?), although I don’t know exactly when it happens, so I’m hoping there’s a surprise or two left in the old game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An RPG (or role-playing game, for you normals) is perhaps my favorite type of video game.  I&#8217;ve certainly spent the most hours playing them over any other type of game.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The story.  The characters.  I get sucked in and I don&#8217;t want to leave. This is why I won&#8217;t go near <em>World of Warcraft</em>&mdash;it would be the end of me.  Someone would find me at my desk six months later, dead from starvation and dehydration, a mouse still in the grip of my cold, bony hand and my ivory fingers resting on the keyboard’s W-A-S-D keys.</p>
<p>No one needs to see that.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve shied away from <em>World of Warcraft</em>, one series of console RPGs has claimed more hours of life than any other: <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>
<p>I love the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, especially <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> (released as <em>III</em> for the Super Nintendo outside of Japan) and <em>VII</em> for the original Sony Playstation.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve completed the first <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>VI</em>, <em>VII</em>, <em>VIII</em>, <em>IX</em> and <em>X</em>. Not to mention <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> and <em>Tactics Advanced</em>. And I&#8217;m currently playing through the Nintendo DS remake of <em>Final Fantasy IV</em> right now (released as <em>II</em> for Super Nintendo in the USA).  You could say I’ve earned my <em>Final Fantasy</em> stripes.</p>
<p>Thirteen years after <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>&#8216;s release, I decided to play through it again, and blog along the way.</p>
<p>I remember when this game came out.  It was a big deal.  I had had just leveled up from the Super Nintendo to a Sony Playstation.  Games were changing.  Two-dimensional games with cute, colorful sprites were on their way out.  Three-dimensional characters and realistic backgrounds were starting to take over.</p>
<p>My first experience with <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> was via a PlayStation demo disc that came with a gaming magazine.  I only got to play the first ten minutes or so of the game, but I played the hell out of it, over and over.</p>
<p>It was like nothing I had ever played before.  The graphics.  The characters.  The setting.  Even the music was amazing.</p>
<p>I eventually bought my own copy (all three CD-ROMs worth), and the rest is history.</p>
<p>The story was like nothing I had seen in a game before.  The plot was complex, with dramatic twists and turns comparable to anything on the big screen at the local movie theater.  </p>
<p>The same went for the cinematic cut scenes&mdash;remember the motorcycle chase scene?  It was right out of a big budget action film.</p>
<p>And it was the first video game I ever played where characters swore at each other.  Back in 1997, a game where characters threw words around like “shit,” “ass,” and “damn” was groundbreaking (at least to my sixteen-year-old self).</p>
<p>Pick up that buster sword, equip some materia and join me on a trip back to the gaming days of the late 1990s.  Will the game hold up?  Will I like it as much at 29 as I did at sixteen? We shall see.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain: no naming the female characters after high school crushes this time around.</p>
<p>Oy.  High school.  I don’t miss being sixteen.  Not.  One.  Bit.</p>

<p>Thirteen years ago, at the age of seventeen, I saw the opening for <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> for the first time.</p>
<p>I was so excited with the opening sequence (remember this game’s graphics were incredible for the time) that I cut class for a week* and barreled through the first disk. The game itself, if you haven’t played it is massive. The scope of the world, politics, weapons, and items is an OCD completionist’s dream (nightmare?)&mdash;and my friends were all OCD completionists. Between the lot of us, about seven, we have easily played a thousand hours, if only to get to the snowboarding mini-game in the Golden Saucer. So, you shouldn’t be surprised when a series of tacit rules developed.</p>
<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>
<p>Naming conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud can be named whatever you like as long as it is a derivative of the names you use in other RPGs.</li>
<li>Tifa is to be named after your current crush (there were no rules about girlfriends, but who are we kidding, the hours logged into <em>FFVII</em> pretty much precludes that possibility).</li>
<li>You don’t fuck with Aeris/Aerith. She is not to be renamed.</li>
<li>Barrat is to be renamed Mr. T. If you didn’t do this your first play through, I don’t know what’s wrong with you.</li>
<li>Red XIII is to be named after your favorite pet, unless you have never had one, then “Red” or a favorite movie animal is acceptable.</li>
<li>Cait Sith is to be renamed after the most despicable person you know. Personally, I hated this tradition and always named him “Fluffy” in protest. Cait Sith may be flawed, but he is still a deeply moral “person.”</li>
<li>Vincent needn’t be renamed, but if he is, it must be after a popular vampire. Recent pop culture phenomena makes this both an exciting and amusing prospect.</li>
<li>Cid, out of respect for the Final Fantasy lore, is not to be renamed because he is a badass.</li>
<li>Yuffie is to be renamed after the most aggravating woman you know.</li>
</ul>
<p>OCD completionist conventions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your first mastered “All” materia is to be sold so you never have to worry about money again.</li>
<li>Real men don’t breed a golden chocobo, they trade the desert rose for it.</li>
<li>A game is not complete unless you get “<a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_Jnp3pSPUY">Freak</a>” on every time trial in the snowboarding mini-game.</li>
<li>Every character in your party must have all the Master Materia equipped.</li>
<li>Don Corneo <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_T9SVDqJPI&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=331s">must pick you</a> over Tifa or Aeris.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not spoil the end of disk one!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I can’t promise I will fulfill all of these rules this time around (I don’t have the luxury of cutting work for a week**), but I would be remiss in not explaining how to play the game properly, if only for my conspirators, Daniel and Gavin, to see an opportunity to earn my respect.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>*How does a seventeen year old cut class for a week without getting in caught? Well, it requires a health dose of fuck-all and an apartment owned by a college dropout who can buy beer. That time in my life is a worthy story, almost <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4zyjLyBp64&amp;feature=related">Bueller-esque</a>, but only in the context of two packs of smokes and a bottle of Blanton’s.</p>
<p>**That’s a lie. I have plenty of time, I just don’t want <em>FFVII</em> to cut into my <em>Cataclysm</em> time. My <a target="new" href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/moon-guard/laggytoes/advanced">level 85 Mage</a> has a long way to go before raiding.</p>
