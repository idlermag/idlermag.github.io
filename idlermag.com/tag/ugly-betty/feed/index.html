										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Indelicato is most known for his role on ABC’s <em>Ugly Betty</em> as Justin Suarez, Betty’s sharp-witted and kind-hearted nephew. But the young actor and singer has recently begun trying his hand at fashion journalism and photography, and has grown into quite a style inspiration. Today, I have the pleasure of chatting with Mark about his exciting new fashion blog, his future plans, and the next step in his life: college. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Early this year you did a &#8220;Fashion Week Diary&#8221; for </em>Teen Vogue Magazine<em> and started your own style and photography blog, <a href="http://www.thefashiongangster.typepad.com/" target="_blank">The Fashion Gangster</a>. Who or what inspires you fashion and photography-wise? Can you name some of your favorite photographers and designers?</em></p>
<p>I find the entire fashion industry intriguing. <a href="http://www.thefashiongangster.typepad.com/" target="_blank">The Fashion Gangster</a> was just a spur of the moment idea that I had, and I&#8217;m so happy it has really taken off! A lot of my inspiration for <em>Fashion Gangster</em> shoots comes from Terry Richardson. The clean white background really lets viewers focus more on the model and the garments they&#8217;re wearing. My very favorite designers are Rick Owens and Alexander Wang. There are so many more, but it would take forever to tell you all of them! </p>
<p><em>Your photos have a bit of a 1970s flair and a crisp but edgy street style, which I love. What kind of camera do you use? Do you do your own lighting for the shoots?</em></p>

I am so inspired by the 1970&#8217;s and David Bowie, so I&#8217;m glad you can see that. I use a Nikon D5000. I do my own lighting for every shoot but it&#8217;s not highly produced at all! I just went to Home Depot and bought a giant construction light and that&#8217;s all I use!</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s coming up next for </em>The Fashion Gangster<em>? It looks like you have a great circle of model friends who mesh well with your style.</em></p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;s next for <em>The Fashion Gangster</em>? I really enjoy the blog and will continue to do what I am already doing with it! My models are my best friends, so it&#8217;s always wonderful shooting them.</p>
<p><em>You’ve been a working actor for almost half your life. How old were you when you started training at The Actor&#8217;s Center in Philadelphia?</em></p>
<p>I really have always been interested in performing. I was 6 when I started training at The Actor&#8217;s Center.</p>
<p><em>You were twelve when </em>Ugly Betty<em> began and sixteen when the series ended. What was it like growing up on the set? Growing up in the public eye?</em></p>
<p>Growing up on set was so amazing. I got to grow up around such amazing, driven people and I truly believe it was being around those people constantly that shaped me into the person I am today. The public eye is not always the greatest. Being criticized constantly when you&#8217;re in your early teens is not the best for one&#8217;s self esteem. But, it&#8217;s something that you have to take with a grain of salt and move past, and that&#8217;s what I did.</p>
<p><em>You just had a reunion with the </em>Ugly Betty<em> cast this month. Were you excited to see your former cast members again?</em></p>
<p>Of course! Since the show ended we have all been on different coasts, so getting together again was so great.</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;re applying to colleges right now. What do you intend to study? Any plans to return to acting after (or during) college?</em></p>
<p>I plan to study either fashion or journalism. I would love to dabble in the fashion industry and see what happens with that. I plan to act, but college and little more self discovery need to come first! </p>
