										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent video game film, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> (2012), has been called by some &#8220;the best video game movie ever made.&#8221; On the surface, that sounds like quite the endorsement, but if you dig deeper, such a title doesn&#8217;t carry much weight when you look at the rest of the sample in question.</p>
<p>In short, it is almost like calling <em>Rambo III</em> (1988) &#8220;the best Rambo-goes-to-Afghanistan movie ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s an exaggeration, but not far from the mark.</p>
<p>The original <em>Tron</em> (1982) is perhaps the only other video game film worthy of battling <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> for the title of &#8220;best video game ever,&#8221; because let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; most video game movies ain&#8217;t that good.</p>
<p>One would think, with plenty of captivating stories played out on home consoles every day, making a great video game movie would be easy. For some reason it is not.</p>
<p>Why? I don&#8217;t know, maybe, unlike <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, most video game films don&#8217;t embrace their video-gameness. <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not, which is the Achilles&#8217; heel of most video game films. <em>Resident Evil</em> (2002)? How do you screw up a special forces team fighting zombies in a spooky mansion?</p>
<p><em>Street Fighter</em> (1994)? That is worthy of its own article. Man, I waited <em>in line</em> on opening night to see that turkey.</p>
<p>And then there is the gold standard of failed video game films: <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (1993).</p>
<p>I confess to <strong>a)</strong> seeing <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in the theater on opening weekend and <strong>b)</strong> owning the DVD.</p>
<p>Yes, years later, as an adult, I made the conscious decision to own the film.</p>
<p>Is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8220;good&#8221;? That depends on what one considers good. Story-wise, no, not really. It&#8217;s just strange. Entertainment-wise, yes, because it is so ridiculous. Get some beers, call over your friends, and put on <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8212; there is no way you don&#8217;t enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Plus, Mojo Nixon <a title="video on youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4_nFgY7PZA">has a cameo</a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4_nFgY7PZA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Why is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <b>so</b> strange? Because it didn&#8217;t embrace its video-gameness. The film tries to explain the <em>hows</em> and <em>whys</em> of the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> universe, which is its biggest mistake &#8212; but it is also the reason why it is so hilarious.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the film in a vacuum. If the screenwriters were told &#8220;try to explain how this universe with King Koopa and mushroom people could really happen,&#8221; they made quite the effort. An asteroid knocking dinosaurs into a parallel dimension, where they evolved into humanoids? OK.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great for an episode of <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Sliders</em>, but it doesn&#8217;t really belong in a movie about <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need realistic explanations for plumbers growing into giants or shooting fireballs at angry turtles as they try to save a princess. People accept <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> for what it is: <b>fantasy</b>.</p>
<p>And this is how <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> earned its many praises: it ups the fantasy and doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not. There isn&#8217;t any screen time devoted to <i>why</i> the video game characters are &#8220;alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>They just <i>are</i>, and that is good enough for me.</p>
<p>But, on some level, I am glad <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> tried to be as serious as it is &#8212; otherwise, I may not have one of my favorite bad movies to watch with friends.</p>
