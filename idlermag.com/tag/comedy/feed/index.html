										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know Claire Huxtable and Roseanne Conner are pretty fantastic big mamas of the small screen, but who will make my list of dream moms?</p>
<p><strong>Linda Belcher of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em></strong></p>
<p>If I could only pick one TV mama to be my very own, it would have to be Linda Belcher. With big flippy hair, a penchant for sing-narrating everything she’s thinking, and a flair for the dramatic, this burger joint matriarch could very well be my genetic mother (I might be part cartoon). Linda is fantastic and refreshing because she’s so dorkily proud of her kids even and especially when they are doing or saying what others would deem troubling or strange. Tina’s writing erotic fiction about her peers? Linda excitedly responds to the “artsy fartsy” creativity of this hobby exclaiming, “Freaky friend fiction, all right!” When her attempt at producing dinner theatre in the restaurant is poorly reviewed &#8212; the set looks like children made it &#8212; rather than taking a negative critique negatively, she’s bursting with pride. It was made by children! Her children! </p>
<p>Ms. Belcher is a cool, kooky, sweet, funny mom who loves everything her kids make and do. A bastion of support, jokes, and cuddles, she can be a little over-the-top motherly, but ultimately I admire that she’s so incredibly hard to disappoint. She showers her family of weirdies with respect and accolades that ring perfectly silly and genuine and she does so without asking them to be better. Instead, she can be counted on to accept them and celebrate them as they are. Now, that’s all kinds of  “all right!”</p>
<p>Here’s Linda kissing her porcelain collection of babies. Imagine what she’s like with her real kids!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ns9Mbsr3gUQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Lorelai Gilmore of <em>Gilmore Girls</em></strong></p>
<p>Now, I avoided <em>Gilmore Girls</em> like the plague for a long while when it was on the air. It looked like a sappy, stupid mother-daughter fantasy land where mom and kid are best pals who share all their secrets over root beer and pizza. Well, yeah. Okay, Stars Hollow is pretty much a fantasy place and the Lorelais are definitely fantasy women, but once you get past all your cynical Sally stuff (How can they eat junk all the time and never gain weight? How can they watch all the TV and movies and still have time to read <em>Finnegan’s Wake</em>? How could a real mom be that awesome?) you fall in love with the fantasy. </p>
<p>When Lorelai is being a “drag” of a parent it’s often because she’s pushing Rory to be more daring &#8212; wear a two piece bathing suit, sneak out of the house. Mama Gilmore does anything and everything to provide for her girl; she supplies Lorelai Junior with all the books, warmth, junk food, and cable channels that a growing woman needs. With a ton of femme knowledge that far surpasses regular mom tricks like “smudge some lipstick on your cheekies!,” Lorelai has all the fashion know-how to make a blah cardigan look like a fetching, but not trying too hard, signature piece. When it comes down to it, L.G. is just your typical total knockout, monied teen mom, who leaves the lap of luxury to live life by her own standards and provide for her daughter in the quaintest most pop culturally saturated existence possible. She knows everything from Muppets to Monet, the Go-Gos to <em>Grey Gardens</em>, and just about any of her spit-fire dialogue is incredibly quotable. I’m not ashamed to say it (anymore), I’d love to be a Gilmore Girl. </p>
<p>Lorelai on motherhood.</p>

<p><strong>Sophia Petrillo of <em>The Golden Girls</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve been watching and LOVING <em>The Golden Girls</em> since I was a kid. So, maybe I didn’t get why Rose accidentally buying extra large condoms (and then the grocery guy announcing it for a price check) was hilarious, but everything else translated well, and I’m pretty sure I get that condom joke, now, thank you very much. Even as a girl, I identified with Dorothy (do with that what you will) but you wouldn’t need to be a Dortothy to love her mom, Sophia, and envy their awesomely sarcastic and loving relationship. </p>
<p>Sophia is the perfect little old lady. That grandma shuffle? That wicker bag? A great listener, an old school classic storyteller (“Picture it &#8212; Sicily&#8230;), and the comedic timing and blunt brashness of Don Rickles. Sassy, sexy, and fun, this lil’ mama is just as comfortable volunteering caring for sickies at the hospital as painting the town red with Mr. Burt Reynolds. She’s the kind of mom who you’d actually want to shack up with you and your best buds, and she’s the kind of mom who will continue to love her “pussycat” daughter with all her wicked little Italian heart. . . even if that daughter has sent her to “the home” at least once before. That’s amore!</p>
<p>A favorite Sophia and Dorothy moment. Why isn’t this MY life?!</p>

<p><strong>Lucille Bluth of <em>Arrested Development</em></strong> </p>
<p>Her? Really? Her? Well, no. I don’t want her to be my mom, but I think she’s really funny. She’s all yours, Baby Buster.</p>
<p>“I don’t care for Gob.”  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve written before about <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/14/treat-yoself-to-parks-and-rec/">how much I love <em>Parks and Recreation</em></a> &#8212; the characters, the writing &#8212; but I haven’t been too happy with this season’s trajectory. Though I am pleased with the progression of Chris Traeger’s character and the manner in which his obsessive traits have been seriously examined, the current portrayal of Leslie Knope feels both incredibly off and off-putting. The shift in Chris was unexpected. The writers could easily have kept milking his trademark perfectionism without question &#8212; his extreme fitness and nutrition practices acting merely as reminders that Chris is “that guy,” a strange, yet colorful, weirdo in this merry band of weirdos. But, instead Parks opted for depth. Lately, we’ve seen Chris’ fears laid bare and more overtly witnessed his “quirks” explained as excessive and possibly even disordered behavior. This choice is pretty brave and refreshing &#8212; to show a man who seems perfect, if grossly on top of things, and unpack that perfection as an unhealthy desire for control manifested through unhealthy treatment of his body. Pretty progressive and neat. Parks is usually pretty thoughtful like that. </p>
<p>But then there’s this issue with Leslie. Ever since Leslie got engaged to geeky pocket cutie Ben, things have been weird, y’all. The wedding, per sitcom norm, has taken up a lot of story time and space. On one level that makes me sad because it’s so cliché. Weddings, babies, the addition of a dog, or a cousin Oliver, all seem to mark the death of a show as we once knew it. There’s a sense that when these narratives pop up that maybe the show has run out of steam. I know that in terms of storytelling, this situation can be more complex. Perhaps romances, babies, dogs, and long lost cousins are parts of important stories and that’s why we see them cycled through so often on the television, but I for one, think that there also must be so much more unexplored TV territory and I was hoping my favorite show would go there, courageously and hilariously. </p>
<p>Personally, I’m not all that interested in Ben and Leslie’s romance. I like Ben. I’m glad she found a cool guy, but I’m definitely not gushing over their nuptials. The latest episodes have been particularly uncomfortable to me because they show Leslie barely capable of containing her love for Ben. We learn that getting married to her cute-butted, elflike lover is her dream come true. Spoiler alert, the couple even ties the knot 3 months early because she just can’t wait any longer to be his wife. Um, what? Again, I’m glad that Leslie’s in love or whatever, but when has marriage ever been a top priority for Ms. Knope? The Leslie I know has always wanted to be a strong, fair, and caring woman, an important politician who works for the people of her beloved town, if not the entire nation. Leslie’s dream come true, to me, would look something like President Knope (and maybe first gentleman Joe Biden) raising mini horses on the White House lawn. The Biden husband would be a nice extra, but the presidency and the mini horses would be a must. </p>
<p>So for Parks to get all sweet and saccharine on me, celebrating wuv, twoo wuv, and beyond that painting Leslie as so intensely eager for a typical marital union, without considering the political ramifications of what that union might mean. . . well, it’s a little shocking and disappointing. I know it’s not like we found out that Leslie is a serial killer or she secretly hates puppies, but this move just doesn’t match the tone or consistency of the show and character that I love.</p>
<p>Will marriage end up being more of a struggle now that the fun, pretty, and sugar-coated part is over? (The bachelor party episode did indeed remind us that almost every male character is divorced, after all). Will the old Leslie’s passion for politics return as though no sitcom narrative cliché ever occured? Or will this strange feminist show I love jump the Pawnee shark (raccoon?) and become a more typical network show? Time will tell, I guess.</p>
<p>Instead of titillating my inner romantic, Leslie and Ben making it official has left me mourning stories where it’s okay for women to want different things, want more, want something beyond or outside marriage. I’m left wishing the Hillary Clinton of the hilarious memes could send my gal Leslie a text, cuz, Giiiirrrrl, something’s up with your game. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us know Nick Offerman as the straightforward, bacon-eating, curmudgeon, Ron Swanson, of NBC’s <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. He’s made quite a name for himself there playing the role of a strictly anti-government parks worker to deadpan perfection. Reaching the heights of pop cultural iconography, his Swansonisms sprawl across the internets and he’s won the masses over with his affectless stoicism, the charm of one eyebrow raised ever so slightly. But like his lovely wife before him, Megan Mullally, who played the fantabulously drevil (drunk and evil) Karen Walker on <em>Will and Grace</em>, it’s become easy to equate the actor with their most famous role. Though Swanson and Offerman do share a lot in common (meat hankerings, saxophone playing, finely groomed mustaches) there are many faces to Offerman that you may not have seen yet. </p>
<p>Having read a number of Offerman interviews and articles, I knew that he was a legit farm boy who then studied stage acting and excelled not only at his theatrical craft, but also in the crafting of sets and costumes. Though he has lots of Hollywood experience, he also feels at home performing Kabuki theater and abstract postmodernist plays. He makes silly music videos with his wife and runs a serious carpentry business where he builds beautiful furniture and seaworthy canoes. Quite a talented grab bag, this fella. That being said, I wasn’t exactly sure what I’d signed up for by purchasing a ticket to <em>American Ham</em>, Offerman’s one-man show. </p>
<p>Well, last Friday night I plopped myself down in my folding chair in the Royal Oak theater &#8212; close enough to be giddy, far away enough that I couldn’t easily storm the stage (you’re welcome, Nick). No opening act, no announcer, no muss no fuss, Nick Offerman sauntered on stage with that trademarked direct stare and downturned grumpy cat mouth. Shirtless, wearing jeans and a guitar strapped to his bod, he made his way to the mic, offered a brisk hello and promptly put on a denim stars and stripes shirt. Our semi-nudity for the night complete, he got down to business. </p>
<p>The next couple hours consisted of spoken word and sometimes musical didacticism &#8212; a fine marriage of honesty, humor, and personal philosophy. Like the traveling Chatauqua shows of the early 21st century, his show is a kind of educational entertainment for adults. Though he begins by espousing Biblical teachings the ilk of “Do unto others,” he also heartily deconstructs “The Good Book” claiming that <em>The Hobbit</em> is also a good book that is far more consistent. (Offerman knows a lot about elves and wizards and things &#8212; a fun nerd surprise). He unpacks the importance of engaging in romantic love, no matter what your sexual preference, and exposes the ridiculous sexism of the Bible’s male writers who helped solidify a culture of woman fear and woman hating. I liked this part a lot. Any man who reminds his peers that menstruation is not disgusting or unclean gets a high-five from this gal. Beyond this, he discusses the value of “please and thank you,” the power of hard work, and good drugs (used responsibly, of course). He urged us be in nature, avoid the pitfalls of the mirror (our flaws are not as awful as advertisers claim), and he strongly suggested that we pick up a hobby, develop a discipline, find passion for a craft and the honing of it. Oh, and always carry a handkerchief to wipe a sweaty brow, politely blow one’s nose, or apply a tourniquet to a bleeding neighbor’s flesh wound. </p>
<p>Offerman is clearly a man who delights in words, multisyllable ones and curse words alike. He takes pleasure in speaking slowly and picking the appropriate term for the situation, likes the feel of a complex notion taking shape on his tongue. But perhaps best of all, his calm, measured lecturing is easily broken by a mischievous giggle that bubbles up out from under his mustache at odd intervals. The crowd could not help but burst into laughter in response every time. </p>
<p>Was there some Ron Swanson in there? Definitely, but not too much. <em>American Ham</em> was very much about balance. It showed me that Nick Offerman has delighted in being both a stalwart American man &#8212; a quiet, tree-hewing, meat-grilling sort, but also the gentle idiot, the ham who plays and wants to be seen playing, the kind of man who hand-makes cards for his “sweet stack of curves” wife along with the dorkiest loving song about how hard he’s gonna do her. Likewise, though his show takes us back in time to a simpler, plainer form of entertainment, it is good and hearty fare. See the show, go outside, make a craft. Those Ron Swanson gifs will still be there when you get back, and if Offerman is right, they’ll be all the sweeter once you’ve earned them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em> was a big deal for Louis C.K. Sure, anyone who hosts at least seems to realize the import of their insertion soundly into popular culture through this practice, but I still imagine this experience was a little more stirring for someone like Louis. Unlike a trendy young starlet, quirky pro athlete, or multi-talented musician, C.K. is a comedian; when he walks into Studio H8 he’s entering the hallowed halls of the comedians that came before him. There’s a precedent. There’s history. There’s awe. At the New York Public Library’s memorial for George Carlin, C.K. remembers his first aware, intense, and moving fit of laughter as brought forth by Carlin on <em>SNL</em>. <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/george-carlin-monologue-2/268365/" target="_blank">“What do dogs do on their day off? They can’t lie around &#8212; that’s their job&#8230;”</a> In relating this story of a joyful first, he makes a personal connection to that man and that show, through laughter, as the point in which he knew he wanted to be a comedian. This link to <em>Saturday Night Live</em> alone is huge, then add on top of that the disastrous effects of Sandy on New York and boy does the ante get upped. </p>
<p>In an email to his fans, Louis writes: </p>
<blockquote><p>Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness. It can&#8217;t even be called a trip through time, because as long as new york has lived, its been lit. By electricity, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene. But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, to walk through the heart of it and feel like, in a way, it was dead. I can&#8217;t tell you how that felt.</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on in his letter to relate that when he walks on for his monologue he’ll be thinking about the people of New York, the people from <em>SNL</em> who worked so hard to put together a show amidst chaos, and his place as a comedian and New Yorker in relation to these various communities of public and fans. A huge C.K. fan myself, I must say I was incredibly moved by his writing to us in his alone moments before the show started. I could picture him nervous, a little sweaty, and gracious. This is the comedian I love. </p>
<p>On a personal level, it also meant a lot to me that he did his monologue old school, and in typical comedian-style, he just performed some stuff from his most recent shows &#8212; material I was lucky enough to hear at the Masonic Temple in Detroit in early October. Not only did he share work I’d heard live, but he shared my favorite story. </p>
<p>The story entails Louis making his way through the airport and this little old lady falls down. Inveterate misanthrope that he is, he pantomimes watching the lady tumble as he looks appropriately shocked, but clearly hopes someone else will help her. Well, no one does. The onus falls on our anti-hero and he’s like, “great, now I have an old lady.” He ends up schlepping this ancient broad and her bags and her onion paper travel documents through the busy airport. Many jokes are cracked at her expense. Poor put-upon Louis! He just wants to be anti-social and this happens to him! And the extended story culminates with C.K. sitting and talking with the woman all day and he finishes his telling in a bratty rushed/hushed and disinterested manner with, “and it was so beautiful to meet her, and she changed my life or whatever, *eyeroll*.”  </p>
<p>I like this joke because it has heart. It’s not super mushy sweetness, in fact it’s mostly girded by Louis’ discomfort with people, especially people who are different from him (old, from another country, or at least culture), and his unease when circumstances push him into intimate moments with this other. It’s truthful, it’s personal, it’s not the kind of joke you’ve heard over and over. It explores everyday life and emotion closely and carefully and ultimately it peels back superficial layers of stalwart masculinity and the coldness of the modern urban citizen and finds more. It opens up a space for Louis and for men and for people in general to understand themselves beyond the labels that keep us safe and comfortable. This is exactly the kind of revelatory work I love to see Louis do.  </p>
<p>It was important to me to watch C.K. pluck this piece, from a show of really strong and probably more easily digestible material, for this super important spotlight moment because it showed me that C.K. is still interested in what’s difficult, what’s hard and what’s weird and that he’s going to keep growing. His most recent show was great, really strong, up there with some of the best comedians in terms of laughability, pacing, content, but there’s a “But.” As good as it was, it felt a little bland, a little vanilla. . . from Louis. From anyone else, just fine, but from Louis I expect more. More darkness, more anger, more gurgling pit of stomach, kid hating, shameful, edgy moments, or at least risk, vulnerability. Instead there was a bit of ease. Is it because he’s getting older? Is he running out of ideas? Or is the Louis of old gone now that he’s incredibly renowned and Emmy-winning, <em>SNL</em>-hosting, famous? I think Ricky Gervais hits it on the nose when he pinpoints Louis’ precise draw as, “this is a man falling apart for my pleasure!” What’s left when our man is fairly put together? </p>
<p>The show I witnessed was about men and women (Louis’ getting “a lot of pussy,” or going on a lot of “nice dates” depending on which of his friends you talk to), how awesome boobs feel, and how young thin white guys are the worst and pretty much get whatever they want while the rest of us are fucked, and not in the fun way. There were some strong humorous hypotheticals &#8212; what if it were legal for everyone to kill just one person? And there was a pretty great story about C.K. moving on up to a fancier apartment community and how one of the richies came over to question his presence on the property. This allowed us some moments of that gruff C.K. we know, he’s angry and he’s just hoping this asshat comes over and tells him something, tries to kick him out. The audience digs in and thrills at the thought. . . ooooh, it’s gonna be good when Louis gets pissed! And he does! And it’s awesome, but then the disclaimer: none of this actually happened. The dude came up and said hi to Louis like he belonged there. Good story and all, but I think it also highlights his easier life and further separates us from him. Louis was the guy who was always getting shit on and we could commiserate with that, now he’s the guy in tuxedos, on the TV, in the fancy apartment. His fantasy of not belonging makes a lot of sense as a way of clinging to who he was and feeling a little unsure of how to deal with who he’s becoming. </p>
<p>I was starting to think maybe this was the case. Maybe Louis is fattening up on the good life and leaving me and all the other lonely ones behind with all our weirdness. I comforted myself with the idea that maybe his absurdist show provides him enough of an outlet for mining the abject and that leaves his stand-up room to take on a new shape (which is fine, even if it’s not as challenging or interesting to me). But then, he went on <em>SNL</em> and he didn’t talk about boobs, or dating, or dudes, or wanting to kill people. He talked about little old ladies, and that made me think that maybe everything with me and Louis is going to be all right. And by all right I mean strange, uncomfortable, and difficult ever after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It probably says a lot about me that the first show I ever recorded with a DVR was ALF. No, not some new reboot. The <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JDUBE2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JDUBE2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank">original show from the 1980s</a>. Yes, I now have access to a state of the art TV recording device, and I use it to record sitcom reruns.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>Like most who share my 31 years, I grew up watching ALF. I remember watching reruns after school as a kid. This might explain how I developed my own smart-mouth sarcastic humor (and perhaps, my fondness for cats). As a kid, the show&#8217;s draw was it had a puppet. But, as an adult, I get much, much more of the humor and enjoy its brilliant absurdity.</p>
<p>OK, and I still like that it has a puppet.</p>
<p>I watched a favorite episode the other day &#8212; where the Tanners throw a Halloween party, and ALF shows up with a zipper taped to his chest to pass off as a guest (<a href="http://alf.wikia.com/wiki/Some_Enchanted_Evening" target="_blank">“Some Enchanted Evening”</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still laughing about it. Yes, it was a cheesy, simple gag, but I loved it. The visual is hilarious on two levels &#8212; the zipper looks totally out of place, and ALF interacting with a room full of adults, instead of just the Tanners, really puts the focus on his shortness.</p>
<p>Ah, <em>sitcoms</em>.</p>
<p>The episode also has one of my favorite comedic reversals. I&#8217;m paraphrasing here, but it goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Willie: Where did you get that zipper?</p>
<p>ALF: You know that old jacket you&#8217;ve been meaning to throw out?</p>
<p>Willie: Yeah.</p>
<p>ALF: Well, you might wanna hang on to it. I ripped this out of your new raincoat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! Classic.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care much for sitcoms these days, but I will always watch ALF when I can. Maybe it is the connection to my youth, or maybe it is the humor.</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, I like smart-mouth puppets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eddie Murphy has made plenty of odd films. But, at least his odd film of the 1980s was odd in an interesting way, not because he wore a fat suit.</p>
<p><a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305310351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=6305310351&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>The Golden Child</em></a> (1986) is odd, because it blends action, comedy, fantasy, and elements of Chinese mysticism.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Yes, <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUCQX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QUCQX8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>Big Trouble in Little China</em></a> has all of those things too (and they came out the same year).</p>
<p>But, only one of these films has Eddie Murphy, and that is the big difference (even though Kurt Russel is great in <em>Big Trouble</em>). I have read <em>The Golden Child</em> was <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Child#Production_details">originally planned</a> as a very serious adventure film, but when Murphy was brought on, it switched gears.</p>
<p>So, now you have Eddie Murphy fighting demons, traveling to Tibet, and searching for magical weapons.</p>
<p>Ah, the 1980s. What an era for film.</p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s humor and comedic timing help balance the mystical elements of the film. Had this film taken itself more seriously, I doubt it would have been nearly as enjoyable. Just when the story gets really deep into the mystical side, there&#8217;s Murphy with a joke, or a goofy expression to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>When you have a story with a demon in human form trying to feed a supernatural child blood to weaken his powers, you need a few jokes here and there. It helps keep the dark, occult themes (of which there are many) from overpowering the story.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some &#8220;whatever&#8221; moments, such as when Murphy has to carry a glass of water through an obstacle course without spilling a drop. And, why is a social worker The Chosen One who can save The Child?</p>
<p>But who cares? There is also a dragon lady. And let us not forget the classic, “I want the knife” scene.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr0JXSM_0Nk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I have probably watched this film, in part or in whole, about a hundred times. It was a fixture on TV in my youth. It was almost always on at any given point, especially the weekends. Sure, it is an odd film, but it has a bit charm, thanks to Eddie Murphy in his prime. This was just after <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>, when he could do no wrong.</p>
<p>Some might disagree, and say <em>The Golden Child</em> was Murphy&#8217;s only stumble during his string of hits in the 1980s. Compared to his other films of the eighties, <em>The Golden Child</em> sticks out like a sore thumb, but only due to its plot. In terms of box office, the film was a success (although, I have read, not in the eyes of the studio).</p>
<p>And as someone who grew up in the 1980s, <em>The Golden Child</em> was a success in keeping me entertained. Over and over again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to this, the greatest of seasons, that wonderful time in which we are gifted new television shows from the networks, writers, and actors, I expect to take the good with the bad.  Pilots are pilots; they are rough and rusty little things, that are trying (often too hard) to get noticed when they aren’t even quite sure who they are yet, what their voice is, or where their soul lies. So, as exciting as it is to check out the newbies, I know that I have to watch for what’s working and forgive a lot of blahs that come with a new show’s desire to win a fickle and already overstimulated audience. I understand that there will be attempts to copy flimsy trends and well-worn formulas and that some of the greatest shows need time to develop. However, in this year’s lineup, I have to say then that I’m more than a little surprised to feel so immediately tapped into a program, especially as it’s one that I had harshly prejudged and pre-benched for bored-on-the-weekend viewing only. I gotta say, I’ve been loving NBC’s <em>Go On</em>, pilot and all.  </p>
<p><em>Go On</em> stars Matthew Perry as fancypants L.A. sportscaster, Ryan King, whose wife recently died in a car accident. Not dealing too well with the grieving process (he attacks a famous athlete for texting while driving, the very thing that killed his wife), he’s required to get some sessions in with a group that is likewise working through rough life transitions. Now, the group setting is where the show could slap together a rag-tag crew of oddballs and exploit their instability, or “craziness” for laughs, but <em>Go On</em> doesn’t do this. Instead, it’s the eccentrically loveable ensemble cast that is nicely carrying the show. The episodes are about how lonely it is to be “King,” yes, but it’s also about the group’s many brand’s of loneliness and how they find comfort in community. </p>
<p>The show finely rides the line of the stereotype though &#8212; there’s a cat lady, an angry lesbian, an old blind curmudgeon, an over-anxious Asian-American, a Latina woman who speaks mostly in Spanish, and a young African American kid who won’t open up. Beyond the exaggerated play on type (Fausta’s spanglish and references to Ryan as “Oh, Meester King!” for example), the camera clearly catches the depth of each person. Fausta could easily be simple, marginalized, but we see her sharp sense of humor and her pain at the loss of her family. Anne’s “angry lesbian” could be a throwaway schtick, but instead we’re pushed to understand where her anger comes from &#8212; her partner died because she didn’t take care of her health, and this to Anne is incredibly stupid and infuriating. Though the characterizations are subject to tokenization, the characters are three dimensional and the show’s early episodes suggest that their backstories will be complex, full, and emotional. Should they keep up the careful storytelling, the diversity of the cast will remain impressive. The support group along with Ryan’s work colleagues are all portrayed with nods toward their social context, but ultimately with dignity and normalcy, and that matters. These are not Asians and black people, weirdos or crazies, they are just people. People in messed up, funny/sad situations trying to make it and anyone could relate.  </p>
<p>Sans laughtrack, the show has more freedom to dip into despair, to follow the longing of a well-picked heartbreaking song and then poke out again into Perry’s sarcasm and silliness. I like that instead of painting King as a total bigshot the likes of Joel McHale’s character on Community, <em>Go On</em> presents him as incredibly charming, but given to his foibles. He may not think he needs the support group at first, but he doesn’t ever think he’s better than them. In fact, he has an exuberance for people that is quite endearing. Ryan tends to find a way to make therapy fun and active. Where Lauren, the group’s facilitator, is more well versed in psychological and behavioral theory and the delicate nature of emotions, Ryan is well suited to helping the group laugh, change, face fears, get out of the room and do. These different skill sets play with and against each other well and hint at the kind of issues and relationship concerns that both Lauren and Ryan and the entire group will face this season. And yes, it’s been picked up for a full season.  </p>
<p><em>Go On</em> isn’t blowing my mind or bringing me to tears, or fits of hilarity, but it’s good &#8212; really good. It depicts how and why we hurt and explores why it’s so difficult to talk about our pain, our loss, while also reminding us that this process can be full of ridiculous fears and failures, and funny ones to boot. Instead of building types of people&#8211;someone who has to overcome A, someone with issues with B &#8212; the program reveals unique personalities, ones that I want to continue getting to know. For a brand new, non-cable show, <em>Go On</em>’s come out of the gate strong and it’s invitation is tempting. I’m listening and watching&#8230; &#8220;Go on&#8230;&#8221; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The range of my taste in film covers a wide area. </p>
<p>If my tastes were represented by a country&#8217;s land area, it would be Russia. Despite my fiancée&#8217;s insistence that I don&#8217;t like any film made after 2000 &#8212; mainly because I had not watched <em>Superbad</em> until last week &#8212; I enjoy many different films. My film collection would suggest as much, which ranges from Oscar winning classics of the 1960s to b-movies of the 1980s, and many more. </p>
<p>One film that holds a place of honor on my shelf is the Bruce Willis vehicle, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/" target="_blank">Hudson Hawk</a></em> (1991). It is absurd, ridiculous, and preposterous. </p>
<p>And I love every damn frame. I love the film so much, I even referenced it in <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/13/microsoft-outlook/" target="_blank">one of my comic strips</a>. </p>
<p>I have a soft-spot for absurd action-comedies, and Hudson Hawk is more or less my gold standard. It is also on the short list of films I have purchased in two or more formats: first VHS, and then DVD (<em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, and <em>Army of Darkness</em> being the others. <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> will join that list eventually. <em>Gremlins</em>, however, is the reigning champ: VHS, DVD, and Laserdisc—in that order).</p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> is a love it or hate it film. </p>
<p>Folks I know who love the film, love it to pieces and quote it often (the film is incredibly quotable: “You took down Captain Bob&#8217;s steering wheel?!”, “Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!”, “Hey Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.”). </p>
<p>But, for those who can&#8217;t embrace the absurdity, <em>Hudson Hawk</em> is the worst thing put to celluloid this side of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero" target="_blank">Last Action Hero</a></em> (the subject of a future article). </p>
<p>Is <em>Hudson Hawk</em> a perfect film? Hardly.</p>
<p>But, it is entertaining and hilarious (keep in mind this comes from a guy who draws comics rife with <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/06/schmoopy/" target="_blank">absurd humor</a>). It is full of gags I love to death. The scene where the Pope is watching Mr. Ed dubbed into Italian gets me every time. Another favorite (and speaking as someone who is half-Italian) is when an Italian guard pours spaghetti, with sauce, out of a Thermos.</p>
<p>Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello, to me, form an impressive comedic duo. I love their snappy dialogue and banter. They have chemistry, and they come across as real pals. If you go into <em>Hudson Hawk</em> expecting a <em>Die Hard</em>, you will be incredibly disappointed (although the same could probably be said of <em>Die Hard 2</em>). Yet, if you approach <em>Hudson Hawk</em> as a poor man&#8217;s <em>Ghostbusters</em> or <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>, it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>Maybe. I don&#8217;t make any promises.</p>
<p>If you can find the DVD, give the director commentary by Michael Lehmann a listen. It is as entertaining as it is informative, and I love Lehmann&#8217;s refrain of “Did I mention this film did well in Europe?” after some of the gags. He also explains several scenes which were cut from the film, including a sub-plot about Willis getting revenge for the death of his monkey sidekick, Little Eddie (YES). </p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> isn&#8217;t perfect, and it isn&#8217;t for everyone, but for those, like myself, who enjoy absurdity, it is 100 minutes well spent. </p>
<p>And it is way funnier than <em>Die Hard 2</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amy Schumer’s first hour-long special, “Mostly Sex Stuff,” recently aired on Comedy Central. I’ve read some negative reviews claiming that she’s just another typical female comedian, oversexed, and too caught up in talking about dating, but I tend not to agree. One brilliant internet dude claims that we shouldn’t bother with Amy because if we’ve seen Chelsea Handler’s, Natasha Legerro’s, or Whitney Cumming’s acts we’ve seen Schumer’s. Because women are all the same. The fellas from the <em>Never Not a Nerd Show</em> explain that there are women who are funny socially or as writers, but as one nerd put it, “I’ve never seen stand-up from a woman that’s not “here’s me banging dudes. . .” and “being a girl is hard and vaginas are weird &#8212; that’s the other thing they [female stand-ups] have.” I’d like to go on the record with my own little review because men aren’t the only ones who can plaster their opinions all over the internet. And also because my opinions are better.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_10416" style="width: 340px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10416" data-attachment-id="10416" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/08/22/schumer-humor/amyschumer1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg" data-orig-size="330,385" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="amyschumer1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=257" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=330" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=640" alt="Amy Schumer" title="amyschumer1"   class="size-full wp-image-10416" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg 330w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=129 129w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/amyschumer1.jpeg?w=257 257w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><p id="caption-attachment-10416" class="wp-caption-text">Amy Schumer</p></div> Ultimately, I thought the show was pretty great and I’m pleased to see that Amy is getting the air-time she deserves. Her persona is sharp as she playfully places a dark edge on her exaggerated and cutesy feminine mannerisms. Schumer’s style is all about inviting us into a familiarly gendered space and then exploding, or at least surprising, us out of it. She chats with her audience as though we are a gaggle of gal pals, and telling us about “mostly sex things” she takes us along on her adventures in dating, relationships, and more casual encounters.  Oozing with sarcasm she lulls everyone into the rhythm of the staid stereotypical (female) stand-up.  “Am I right, ladies?” she asks. When she gets a reaction from the crowd, “Thanks, sister-friends!”  But sandwiched in the “Ohmygawd, I’m a girl!” banter is a joke about being tested for AIDS, or how much of a boundary-blind cunt her mom is, or the time her boyfriend wanted to discuss the possibility of bringing assplay into their bedroom. I believe that last joke ended with her calling his bluff, his delicately placing one finger atop her anus, and her giving him the fisting of a lifetime. Yeah. And then she giggles, makes dolly eyes, and twirls her hair a bit.  I love it.  </p>
<p>Though her hour-long show sagged a bit in parts, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her observations, stories, or subject matter. Rather, it seems she has a unique rhythm and her strengths lie in her bracketed offbeats on the way to telling a larger joke. Let me explain what I mean, here. With the fisting joke, the punchline comes quite appropriately with the fisting, but she goes on to give some extra info &#8212; “He’s dead now.” That little line is so powerful. It’s unnecessary, but its excessiveness builds the enjoyment of the previous joke. Likewise, when she’s telling a tale about a man commenting on her “sturdy” build, she parenthetically adds, “He was from Texas. . . or some place I’m not going.”  These little extras, these bits of information that distract from the main focus, can add to the realistic feel of listening to a friend chatting while further playing up her critique of the “privileged white girl” character. </p>
<p>Though one could argue that this isn’t really new territory as one-liners were once the comedy norm, the way she weaves a number of tight and punchy one-liners into a larger set of more complex stories is impressive and really her own.  What she’s doing with her act is strong, but in an hour-long show all those fragments can create some weird beats and awkward pauses.  Yes, in this special not all of her transitions were exactly seamless, but as a young comic, she’s got plenty of time to perfect her timing and flow and work these issues out.  </p>
<p>If my critical breakdown of Schumer humor sucked the life out of all things comedic, perhaps I can sway you with some of the show’s high points that really worked and tickled my funny bone. </p>
<ul>
<li>On being a child and seeing her mom’s bushy pubic hair situation for the first time: &#8220;Is Mom being swarmed by BEES?&#8221;</li>
<li>On seeing an uncircumcised penis for the first time: (on phone) &#8220;Mom, can you come pick me up? . . . I don’t know &#8212; It’s wearing like a hat, or a cape. . . I don’t know!&#8221;</li>
<li>On using a toilet at a club after she assures us she’s not going to say anything gross: &#8220;So, there I was, just dropping a TON of heat. . . just massacring this bowl. . . I’m texting people, &#8216;Am I DYING?'&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>See?  She’s got the funny. She’s got the chops. She’s got boobs and vag and miraculously these body parts aren’t holding her back.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, the show is worth watching. If you know her work, you’ll see Schumer branching out a bit in places while also honing the voice she’s created. Sure, I’m excited to see her go a little deeper and lend more time to her discussions of class, race, feminism, and stand-up itself, but these things will come with time. I say, don’t listen to the internet guys who suggest you avoid her work for being too girly. (How quickly men forget how often we’ve patiently listened to their sex stories and their detailed depictions of their nether regions.) I say, nut up and imagine what it’s like to have an ovary for a second, fellas. What doesn’t kill you will make you stronger. . . and perhaps more highly educated, and worthier adversaries as fellow nerds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her 2009 comedy album <em>Unwanted Thoughts Syndrome</em>, Maria Bamford prefaces a bit about aging with the following warning: “This joke might fall under the category of something only I enjoy.”  This is one of those cases where it’s funny ‘cause it’s true.  Though I find Bamford’s work hilarious, playful, darkly intelligent, and fun, I’ve noticed that when I try to share her genius with friends I get a less than enthusiastic response.  Think of how people don’t want to try sushi. “Oooh, raw fish? Aah.  Huh. Wrapped in seaweed, too, I see.  No, no, thanks, but you just eat that yourself.”  That face that’s trying to be polite, but disgust is creeping all over their visage.  Their head shaking a “no,” their hand gesturing “halt, there will be no sushi in this gullet!”  This is oftentimes the reaction I get from sharing Maria’s material.  But, to be fair, Bamford (aka The Bammer) isn’t your typical stand-up. If you want simple laughs unpacking the quirky inanity of airplane food, men vs. women, black guys drive like this/white guys drive like this, well, you’ve come to the wrong comedy show.</p>

I could go on.  Though one could lazily label her silly, just a weird voice lady, or as one radio deejay so inanely misread her,  a “schizophrenic,” if you listen closely you might hear how her woman of a million voices act quite brilliantly sketches what it feels like to be Maria &#8212; to inhabit her skin, her space, her mind.  And if we’re honest, we might find that all her “weird” characters, offbeat thoughts, songs and reactions are pretty familiar to our own experience.  You know that you at your core?  The one that likes popping zits, eating ice cream for breakfast, narrating the thoughts of your maniacally evil cat in Broadway style with jazz hands and aplomb?  Yeah, that’s the self we usually tidy up and edit out and that’s the one that Maria shares with us in public, on stage.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I actually had the (strange) fangirl pleasure of seeing Maria live in Ann Arbor, MI and it wasn’t exactly what I expected.  First off, I’ve always seen comedians perform in theaters, casino auditoriums, or arenas. The venues seemed to support the idea that the player we came to see was an artist, someone valuable, someone famous, or “big.”  However, the Ann Arbor Comedy Showcase is a lot more like (or at least trying be like) the comedy clubs you’ve seen intermittently on <em>Seinfeld</em> or <em>Louie</em>.  Small cramped quarters. Brick walls. Teeny tiny tables. The audience is ushered in two people to a table and every table is crammed into a semicircular formation around a small spare stage decorated only with a saddish mural of a big city.  The cityscape looks like stage dressing for a high school play.  I could easily walk up to the stage, take the mic, do a jig if I so desired.  There’s none of that spatial separation &#8212; none of those markers that suggest that the performer is not like me, is better.  This makes me sad for Maria.  “She deserves better than this!” my mind screams, and a nervous knot ties in my belly.</p>
<p>I switch seats with my friend Erin &#8212; she joining my husband at a table for two, I filling a half seat next to strangers. And then the fun begins.  A drunk crew of somebody’s moms and dads out for a wild Ann Arbor night squeeze into the spots next to me. The tipsy star of their band immediately starts chatting me up. A woman “alone” at the comedy club &#8212; of course I desire his doting attentions! He entertains, he reads my Facebook phone updates over my shoulder. His wife and friends cheer him on for he’s so funny he should clearly be on stage!  Oh, a laugh riot this guy.  He wants to know is Maria anything like Paula Poundstone?  He likes Paula Poundstone.</p>
<p>Way to know a contemporary female comedian, buddy.  I quietly seethe.</p>
<p>“Nooo, she’s not really your typical stand-up.  She plays a lot with voice work. . .”</p>
<p>“OH, so she does voices.  Can she do Cher?  Sylvester Stallone?”</p>
<p>“No.  Um, she’s not really an impressionist.  She uses the voices to. . .”</p>
<p>“Does she do Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Oh, all right, voices! “</p>
<p>“. . . . . . .”</p>
<p>He went on to showcase his devastating display of comedy knowledge referencing everyone from Sam Kinison to. . . well, Paula Poundstone again.  I went on to call him stupid on Twitter and then concocted elaborate anxiety fantasies of him heckling Bamford, me sitting next to him mouthing to her, “I’m so sorry!”  My stomach at this point was well on its way to cat-o-nine-tails.</p>
<p>The first act was a boring newcomer full of expected and borderline offensive jokes that the old kids sure enjoyed.  Second up was Jackie Kashian &#8212; a friend of Maria’s and strong comedian.  Her work was more story-oriented and built around the ridiculousness of her family, and tales of her nerdish childhood.  Kashian’s style is confident, unshakeably so without being arrogant.  A fine line to walk but she walked it well and all while sporting her Powell’s Books t-shirt.  I liked her.  Dr. Comedy next to me was less pleased but still riding his buzz.</p>
<p>Finally, Maria came on and she was all that I hoped she’d be and more.  The packed closeness that had inspired claustrophobia was now cushioned by loud shared laughter.  The sticky crampedness that built stomach knots gave way into release.  Maybe this layout is part of the build up &#8212; it provides some of the necessary tension that jokes erupt out of, I pondered.  But Maria brought some of this discomfort too.  Her voice could be too quiet, I strained to hear, she babbled her weird thoughts, she’d close her eyes rehearsing what she had told us and what she had yet to say.  One could possibly think she looked unstable or at least fearful, uncomfortable on stage.  There was something true about this but also something that was just part of her performance. I knew she possessed the wherewithal to clean this up, look more “normal” if she wanted to, but she was choosing to show this process as it was.  She does not glibly glide from joke to joke, she gets there messily, truthfully.</p>
<p>But beyond this, I can’t really do her justice as her show relies so heavily on voice and intonation.  For a taste of her sense of humor here’s a story/joke she relayed about a conversation she and her new neighbor shared:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Maria’s new neighbor:</strong> I hope you don’t mind living next to a Mexican &#8212; you know we leave stuff on our lawn.</p>
<p><strong>Maria:</strong> I hope you don’t mind living next to a white lady, because I’m gonna steal that stuff.</p>
<p>MANIFEST DESTINY!  It <em>feels</em> like it’s mine!</p></blockquote>
<p>Old Kinison to my left did not approve.  He was sorry he didn’t get a chance to tell her to her face how badly she sucked.</p>
<p>Erin’s high-pitched laugh squealed behind me. I laughed tearfully.  Maybe she didn’t please everyone that night, but she sure punched some of us right in the comedy gut.</p>
<p>Now, for a comedian to be successful, assuming successful means garnering a wide audience, playing huge theaters, arenas, even, their material needs to hit a sweet spot of broad experience.  It has to fit into, explain and reflect the thoughts, dreams and fears of a good many people.  We tend to mark “the best” by measuring success in this fashion. However, there’s something special about artists like Bamford, performers who refuse to play to the standard and reach every person.  There’s something brave, kinda punk, kinda D.Y.I., feminist awesome about how incredibly close she keeps her comedy.  Her stories all spin out from her unique self and even when she ventriloquizes and lampoons those around her, she maintains the oddity and complexity of her own voice and perspective.  Her show was small, intimate, a little too close and that’s exactly where she’s at home and I felt at home there, too.  She might be too unsettling for even my weird friends, she might not be the next comedy sweetheart to sweep the nation, but she’s honest and amazing in her own right.  She might not steal your heart, but she may steal your stuff. . . and then tell a small crowd a very good story about it.</p>
