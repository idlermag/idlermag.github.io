										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2003 Lars Von Trier decided to become the rock in some else’s shoe. That lucky someone was fellow Dane and film maker, Jorgen Leth. Leth had, in 1967, created a short film called <em>The Perfect Man</em>, of which Von Trier is a huge fan. He invites Leth out of retirement to take part in a little experiment, asking him to remake his ’67 short with a series of obstructions devised by Von Trier himself. The resulting film, <em>The Five Obstructions, </em>is a fascinating documentary on the nature of art and the artist, but it also offers a few insights into Von Trier that have stuck with me ever since. Chief among them is his perception that not only must the creator of the art suffer, but the audience as well.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Five Obstructions" src="https://lightscameraandaction.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/the-five-obstructions.jpg?w=212&#038;h=300" alt="" width="212" height="300" />Von Trier’s first obstruction is an interesting one. He requires Leth to shoot the film in Cuba, creating an instant cultural influence <em>The Perfect Human</em> didn’t have before, and that he use no shot longer than twelve frames, which is approximately half a second of film time. Anyone who has ever created anything knows that limitations (or obstructions) breed creativity, and while Leth initially views Von Trier’s as “totally destructive,” he eventually admits that those twelve frames were a “gift.”</p>
<p>But Von Trier was just getting warmed up.</p>
<p>One of the second obstructions required Leth to shoot in “the worst place in the world,” but refrain from showing the location in the film. Leth chooses to shoot in the red light district in Bombay, hiding the location behind a translucent screen. Von Trier is not satisfied. He punishes Leth by demanding that he either return to Bombay and shoot it again, or comply with whatever Von Trier chooses to replace it. He chooses the latter.</p>
<p>Leth is an absolute angel about all of it, actually, but Von Trier is curiously aggressive with his idol. Shooting in Bombay had little effect on the film and serious effect on Leth. Art is suffering. Suffering is art. I personally find Von Trier’s sadism off-putting, to say the least.</p>
<p>Still, villains are fascinating, aren’t they? And with the release of <em>Antichrist</em> (2009), I once again found myself unable to resist viewing a Lars Von Trier film. It had me with <a href="http://youtu.be/LO-TNfPzh_k">its trailer</a>, filled with haunting imagery and the promise of a legitimate, Lars Von Trier horror film. As it stands, I cannot say that I enjoyed the film, exactly, but I can say that it hasn’t left me.</p>
<div style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Antichrist" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.sofacinema.co.uk/guardian/images/products/screenshots/0/133690-1-large.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="179" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Enjoy. It only gets worse from here.</p></div>
<p>Its leads have no names. They are simply called “He” (Willem Defoe) and “She” (Charlotte Gainsbourg). The film begins with the two making passionate love as their infant son tumbles from their apartment window to his death. The scene is so beautifully shot&mdash;filmed elegantly in black and white, with haunting slow motion&mdash;that you almost forget the horror of it. Almost. Being a therapist, He decides to treat his wife himself, taking her to a cabin in a place called “Eden” (Make of that what you will) where he attacks her grief with relentless reason. The trouble is, Eden is no place for reason. The ground burns She’s feet, the animals talk and, on occasion, acorns rain from the sky. I’ll bet that there’s nothing about <em>that</em> in the AAA guide.</p>
<p>We learn that She has been to Eden before, researching a thesis that may have led her to believe that women are inherently evil. It doesn’t matter if it’s true so long as She believes it. We are given evidence. He eventually learns that She had been intentionally putting their son’s shoes on the wrong feet, causing lasting damage. Perhaps causing him to trip and fall out of an apartment window? It was once believed that women with backwards feet were witches.</p>
<p>The final bit of evidence comes in the form of a flashback. Or is it? Could we be seeing a physical manifestation of She’s madness? Or did she actually watch her son crawl up onto that desk and, with his little feet contorted in his misplaced shoes, fall from the window? It doesn’t matter if it’s true so long as she believes it.</p>
<p><em>Antichrist</em> concludes in the only manner it can; madness. It is, towards its finale, difficult to watch. I may have grown timid in my ripe old age, but I believe that the film could have made its points without the clitoral dismemberment and bloody masturbation scenes (Yeah, those things happen). Von Trier wants to upset you. He wants catharsis. For me, it hurts the end product, which could have been a brilliant film and instead must settle for being an interesting study. I suppose that’s a pretty decent silver medal.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Kirsten Dunst, Lars Von Trier and Charlotte Gainsbourg" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/cannes-melancholia.jpg?w=267&#038;h=200" alt="" width="267" height="200" />And now it’s 2011 and Lars Von Trier is sitting at a table with Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kirsten Dunst intending to promote his latest film, <em>Melancholia<strong>*</strong></em>, but rambling incoherently about being a Nazi instead. I recently learned that, on her deathbed, his mother had confessed to him that the man he had thought was his father, a Jew, was not.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I lived most of my life as a Jew. I wore a skullcap when I had to and laid stones on tombstones in cemeteries. My mother wasn&#8217;t Jewish, but my father, or the man I thought was my father, was. But then I found out that my father wasn&#8217;t my father and my real father was German. <em>And instead of saying I was actually German at the news conference on Wednesday, in my characteristic haste and because I couldn&#8217;t stand the man who turned out to be my biological father, despite my mother&#8217;s telling me he was charming, I said with a kind of typical Danish humor that most people don&#8217;t understand that I was a Nazi. But I&#8217;m not.</em></em></p></blockquote>
<p>He then added:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It was a stupid joke. But that&#8217;s the kind of humor I use when I talk to my friends, who know me and know I&#8217;m not a Nazi. I apologize profoundly for offending people. It was not my intention. I&#8217;ve also offended Germans.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I have watched <a href="http://youtu.be/LayW8aq4GLw">the clip</a> many times over now and no, I don’t believe that Von Trier is a Nazi. No, I don’t even believe that he said it to shock people. I believe that Lars Von Trier is simply a socially awkward human being. Perhaps we can add people to his list of fears?</p>
<p><strong>* I will be viewing <em>Melancholia,</em> as I am a glutton for both amazing filmmaking and punishment.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had long been considering writing a piece about Danish director, Lars Von Trier, but had never really gotten around to it. Then, at the Cannes film festival press conference for his latest film, <em>Melancholia</em>, Von Trier <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LayW8aq4GLw">declared himself to be a “Nazi” and “sympathetic to Hitler.” </a>Well, all right. I suppose that now is as good a time as any.</p>
<p>If it is even possible I’d like to take a step back from that bit of business for the moment (we’ll swing back around) and discuss the reasons that I am often at odds with myself when it comes to the man and his work. I am not terribly fond of Von Trier, but his films tend to be another story. There is no need to choose between discussing either individually as I believe Von Trier and his films are nearly inseparable. So you see: at odds. At the time of this writing I have seen exactly seven of Von Trier’s films. Of the seven I have loved exactly two. I do not regret seeing the five that I did not care for and have plans to see more. Surely that says something of his work.</p>
<div style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="  " title="Breaking the Waves" src="https://i1.wp.com/img.listal.com/image/1421732/600full-breaking-the-waves-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Breaking the Waves (1996)</p></div>
<p>I was introduced to him through <em>Breaking the Waves</em> (1996), a film I stumbled upon in my film school days. It was a good place to start. Its story revolves around a simple girl in a small, Scottish town named Bess (a brilliant Emily Watson performance) who marries an oilman named Jan (Stellan Skarsgard). When Jan is called away to work on a rig for a time, Bess prays incessantly for his return. Her prayers are answered, though he returns paralyzed from the neck down due to an accident. The story takes an interesting turn when Jan, now bed ridden, asks his new wife to have sex with other men, then describe it to him. Jan’s motivations are little explored and, in fact, are almost inconsequential, as <em>Breaking’s</em> real story is Bess’s undying loyalty to him and the lengths she goes to prove it.</p>
<p>Unfamiliar with Lars Von Trier the man, at the time, I attributed Bess’s sweet, emotional rawness in equal parts to both Watson and Von Trier. Having now seen more of both the man and his work, I am forced to imagine that most of that is coming from Watson.</p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<div class="mceTemp">
<div style="width: 290px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Dancer in the Dark" src="https://i1.wp.com/www-movieline-com.vimg.net/images/dancer-in-the-dark300.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="210" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dancer in the Dark (2000)</p></div>
<p><em>Dancer in the Dark</em> (2000) came next for me and solidified my opinion that this Von Trier guy definitely had something figured out. It contains much of the same emotional rawness of<em> Breaking</em>, this time anchored by Icelandic pop star, Bjork. The film revolves around a Czech immigrant (Bjork) living and working in America. Having discovered that her son carries the very same degenerative genetic disease that is slowly stealing her eye sight, she squirrels away what little money she can from her factory job in order to pay for the surgery that will save his vision. She uses her love of musicals to occasionally escape her grim reality and Von Trier uses the music of Bjork to fuel those scenes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Two films in, I began to see familiar themes. It was clear that Von Trier was interested in the female perspective, but it also became clear that his own perspective was quite bleak. His actresses were adding the heart that he could not. Perhaps that’s why he uses so many female leads. I soon read that Bjork’s experience on set with Lars was so trying that she vowed never to make another film. Period.</p>
<p>I began to research. I discovered that he had begun an avant-garde film movement called “Dogme 95” along with fellow Danish director, Thomas Vinterberg. The movement demanded that films be made in strict adherence to a “vow of chastity,” a set of restrictive rules the two men created. Amongst other things, it requires the filmmaker to use only available lighting, on location music and sound, and hand-held cameras.</p>
<p>I read interviews. I learned that Von Trier is afraid. The man himself has stated that he is “afraid of everything in life except filmmaking.” His intense fear of flying has kept him from ever shooting a film outside of Denmark or Sweden, regardless of the story’s setting. He insisted upon driving to France for the festival where he called himself a Nazi. It seems like he could have embarrassed himself more conveniently during a phone interview. Von Trier also suffers from occasional crippling depression, which renders him unable to work. Ladies, get in line.</p>
<p>I soon learned that his next films were to be shot solely on a soundstage with stage lighting only. There would be props, but no real set pieces. The towns in which these films would take place would be drawn out in chalk on the stage floor and they would be shot on digital video. Needless to say, my interest was piqued. Unfortunately, these two films, <em>Dogville</em> (2003) and <em>Manderlay</em> (2005), are largely responsible for my disdain for Von Trier, later solidified by <em>The Five Obstructions</em> (2003). More on that to come.</p>
<p><em>Dogville</em> and <em>Manderlay</em> are companion pieces, both set in the U.S. and containing the same protagonist, a woman named Grace. Grace is portrayed by Nicole Kidman in <em>Dogville</em> and by Bryce Dallas Howard in <em>Manderlay</em>. I’ve have read that Kidman refused to return for the second film, as did James Caan, who plays her father.</p>
<div style="width: 302px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="  " title="Paul Bettany &amp; Nicole Kidman in Dogville" src="https://i1.wp.com/us.ent4.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/lions_gate_films/dogville/_group_photos/nicole_kidman2.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="194" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Enjoy. It only gets worse from here.</p></div>
<p>Grace’s story, as begun in <em>Dogville</em>, is one of suffering. On the run from her gangster father, Grace stumbles upon the mountain town of Dogville. She is greeted with apprehension, but soon the townsfolk warm to her as she begins performing small tasks for them to win their acceptance. As time passes some of Grace’s legal troubles are revealed and the police pay the town a visit. Things begin to grow darker. It’s not long before the residents are exploiting Grace’s situation, giving her an impossible amount of tasks to perform or run the risk of being turned in to the police. The town’s men begin raping her daily. A heavy, iron wheel is chained to a collar around her neck, which she drags around for a good deal of the films later half. It is not surprising that Kidman opted out of <em>Manderlay</em>, no?</p>
<p>Bryce Dallas Howard takes the reins in that film (although, luckily avoids the collar), which sees Grace attempting to rid the town of Manderlay of slavery, which has been the status quo for them even after the abolition. It is the better of the two films, having a more coherent point and less rape (that I can recall, at least); but its ending, along with <em>Dogville</em> as a whole, still left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Von Trier’s largely negative view of America was palpable, but that wasn’t the rub. Our country is not above criticism, after all. There was just something about the spirit of the films that got to me.</p>
<p>I realized that it was the venom behind all of it. The downright mean-spirited vibe these films had. It is not so much that terrible things happen to Grace, because terrible things do happen, it is that we are bludgeoned with them. It is as though Von Trier is forcing his internal torments upon us. It does not feel like a shared experience so much as a narcissistic exorcism of inner demons.</p>
<p>Von Trier has said that a film should be like “a rock in the shoe.” There is no point unless there is pain. In a behind-the-scenes confessional from the shooting of <em>Dogville</em> (2003), actor Stellan Skarsgard describes Von Trier as a “hyper intelligent child who is slightly disturbed, playing with dolls in a doll house, cutting off their heads with nail clippers.” Von Trier himself said he believed that the cast was conspiring against him. But the very thing I was growing to hate about him kept me coming back for more.</p>
