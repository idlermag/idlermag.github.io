										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a breakfast purist. Even if, like yesterday, I’m not up and out of bed until noon, I’m having breakfast for my first meal of the day. No cold pizza or soggy leftover bullshit. Breakfast is way too good to miss out on. I also have strict ideas about what breakfast should be. For example, I don’t think steak belongs anywhere near my eggs. Nor ham. What is this, lunch? No. I’ve only recently come to terms with potatoes as part of breakfast, and even that’s iffy.</p>
<p>Because of my irrational breakfast rules, I was never interested in biscuits and gravy for breakfast. While I love biscuits, I could not handle the thought of gravy in the morningtime. I realize that it’s gravy made with breakfast sausage, but I couldn’t separate it from the kind of gravy that belongs on turkey and mashed potatoes, and that kind of gravy should get the right the fuck out of my breakfast.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled on this <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/biscuits-and-veggie-sausage-gr-147646" target="_blank">recipe</a> for homemade biscuits and vegetarian sausage gravy. I’m not a vegetarian, but I love Morning Star’s sausage patties because they’re easy to make and a little bit healthier than regular sausage. The pictures on that blog post looked so amazing, they sold me. More often than not, I reject food outright for no good reason at all, so I decided to give this a try.</p>
<p>First came Alton Brown’s biscuits. I’d never made biscuits from scratch before, and the recipe was asking me to do some awfully strange things. I read and reread the recipe to remember what to do. First, I had to mix the fats (butter and shortening) with the dry ingredients WITH MY HANDS. I had no idea what I was doing. I sort of vaguely smooshed the stuff around until it seemed mixed, though it was hard to tell. Then, I made a well in the middle of the bowl for the chilled buttermilk, as instructed:</p>

<p>I stirred the dough until it was just combined, and plopped it onto the cutting board. In order to keep the biscuits fluffy, you’re not supposed to knead the dough very much at all. I got extremely paranoid about over-kneading because WHAT IF THE WHOLE THING IS RUINED. I formed the dough into a circle (a challenge because the dough was so sticky it didn’t want to move where I wanted), and asked Charlie if it was one inch thick.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, “That’s less than an inch.” I have such poor spatial reasoning I’m incapable of seeing what an inch looks like without getting out a ruler. I folded the dough over, but the flour from the cutting board kept the two halves from sticking together. I immediately started swearing and complaining that I&#8217;d screwed it up. The dough did not look cute at all.</p>

<p>The oven was already preheated and there was no point in quitting while I was so far along. Apparently there’s some sort of tool you can use to cut the biscuits into even circles, but I didn’t know such a thing existed. Instead I used a cup to make biscuit slices, putting the leftover scraps together each time to make new biscuits. They were wildly inconsistent.</p>

<p>Into the oven they went, and I started to make the gravy. I cooked the Morning Star sausage patties, crumbling them up as I went, and put them on a plate off to the side. The recipe told me to whisk the flour in with the butter once the butter started foaming. But the pan was so hot from the sausage that the butter started foaming almost instantly, some of it burning in the center of the pan. I panicked and dumped the flour and milk in at once, whisking like it would all be okay if I just WHISKED FAST ENOUGH.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’d messed up the timing, and the biscuits were done earlier than I expected. But they looked delicious, if a little lopsided, so I started to feel like perhaps I hadn’t screwed up everything.</p>

<p>It turns out gravy is really simple, guys. I thought you had to add a bunch of spices or corn starch or something, but it’s just milk, butter, flour, salt, and pepper. I added the sausage back to the gravy, and let it thicken. I called Charlie over multiple times to check if the gravy looked edible, since he’s much more of a gravy expert than I am. Eventually, it started to look like it should.</p>
<p>We split open a biscuit, and between how fluffy they turned out and the way the gravy smelled, I was willing to admit I’d been totally wrong about sausage gravy.</p>

<p>I worried that it might be bland with just salt and pepper for spices, but hot damn was this hearty and delicious. I wanted to put on some flannel and go split logs when I was done. My apologies to sausage gravy for shunning you for so long. We will have to make up for lost time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of breakfast. I eat it early, I eat it late, and just about once a week, I even eat it for dinner. Thus I was happy to discover a few weeks ago that one of my favorite breakfast chains, <a href="http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/" target="_blank">The Original Pancake House</a>, has a restaurant just down the road.</p>
<p>Unlike your normal griddle-based breakfast joint, The Original Pancake House is known for its liberal use of the oven. Their baked omelets are unlike any omelete I&#8217;ve ever had (in a good way &#8212; they claim to mix in a bit of pancake batter), and their signature puffy Dutch Baby pancakes are front and center on the web site.</p>
<p>And the big secret about that glorious, puffy, golden brown, marvel of a pancake? It&#8217;s incredibly easy to make, and a handy dish to have in your repertoire when you&#8217;re looking to impress someone, maybe over breakfast.</p>
<p>The whole thing is really nothing less than culinary magic, where with very little effort, you can produce something spectacular.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend (and normally use) <a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/puffy-oven-pancake-with-berry-topping/fa1070e1-1aed-438d-87c7-5366ff90fff3#?st=6&amp;term=oven pancake&amp;ps=9&amp;pi=9&amp;fv=AND(HasGridViewImage%3ATrue)" target="_blank">Betty Crocker&#8217;s straightforward version</a>, but perhaps in a backhanded attempt to prove that simpler is better, I gave <a href="http://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/Dutch-Baby/23038/?incode=M00KSCR00" target="_blank">the Cook&#8217;s Country version</a> a try.</p>
<p>The oven pancake is basically a big, eggy popover. (For more on popover theory, see Alton Brown parts <a href="http://youtu.be/NjtcyUb4S5M" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/UmKcegIBtkU" target="_blank">2</a>) And like a popover, the one thing that you absolutely must do without fail is to heat the pan before you pour in the batter. The batter itself is fairly forgiving &#8212; you can be technical like Cook&#8217;s Country or basic like Betty without <em>too</em> much difference in the final pancake, but if the pan isn&#8217;t hot, you won&#8217;t get a rise.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much to add to the recipes before you pour the batter in the pan. Unlike a soufflé (or in my house, waffles), you don&#8217;t need to worry about preserving the beaten egg whites. Unlike normal pancakes, you don&#8217;t need to worry about losing the rise from the batter sitting too long once the baking powder meets moisture. Betty will tell you not to overbeat, but you have a pretty big margin of error.</p>

<p>Cook&#8217;s Country called for a 450º oven to Betty&#8217;s 400º, and vegetable oil to grease the pan instead of melted butter. I used canola oil, and it was surprisingly finicky. By the time my batter was ready, the oil had apparently spent more time than it wanted above its smoke point and turned green. It didn&#8217;t affect the flavor at all (the oil doesn&#8217;t really incorporate into the batter), but it didn&#8217;t exactly look appetizing.</p>
<p>Happily, that didn&#8217;t get in the way of the magic happening.</p>

<p>If making a good impression is your goal, make sure that everyone is in the kitchen. The pancake will deflate slightly as it cools, so the big dramatic moment will be when you pull it out of the oven.</p>
<p>Sprinkle some lemon juice and powdered sugar, and brush up on waffles for next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, I’d planned on using up the basil that’s about to go bad in my fridge to make a bacon quiche. But by the time I got home, it was almost 7:30 p.m., and I’d forgotten my roommate was having friends over. There’s nothing to kill your cooking ambitions like a kitchen full of ten people drinking beer. I toasted an English muffin and slapped on some peanut butter to tide me over, then washed it down with two Shipyard Pumpkin Ales. </p>

My go-to late-night dinners are all breakfast: egg sandwiches, cereal, yogurt and granola, or, what I decided on last night: eggs in a basket. I pulled wheat toast and eggs out of the fridge, and put the frying pan on to heat up. When I learned how to make this snack from my friend Nicole, she buttered the bread first, then ripped a yolk-sized hole in the bread, leaving the chef with buttered fingers and a heavily buttered piece of bread to discard (or, more accurately, eat as a pre-snack snack). I decided I was going to rip the holes first, then butter around them. </p>
<p>The trick to making sure that the eggs in a basket turn out is liberal butter. It turns out that trying to butter donut-shaped bread doesn’t avoid getting the butter everywhere, and the cut-out centers of the bread are not nearly as delicious. I set the first piece of bread into the pan, and made the mistake of letting it cook for a bit before dropping the egg in the center. The pan started making an alarming hissing sound (to some, that means cooking, but to me, it means that something is probably burning and about to catch fire), and I had to flip the bread to keep it from burning before the egg had solidified. The egg splattered out from underneath the bread, and I ended up making a sort of egg and bread layer cake. And worse, it turns out that I’d forgotten to add a dash of salt and pepper when I cracked the egg into the pan.</p>
<p>I took the mess out of the pan, and started with egg in a basket number two. I put the bread in the pan, turned the heat down a bit, cracked the egg in right after, and remembered the salt and pepper. I went to throw the egg shells in the trash, and got instantly distracted and began pulling beer cans out of the trash and putting them in the recycle bin. Then, I remembered that I’d forgotten I was cooking. I rushed back to the stove only to discover that the egg was the perfect consistency for flipping. Once I flipped the bread over, I saw that I’d managed to accidentally toast it to the best brownness—crispy, but not burnt. </p>
<p>One of my cooking vices is that I’m not patient. I’m always opening oven doors, lifting up the corners of things in the frying pan, checking and rechecking.  I have a deep fear of things burning and having to start over. But, it seems that leaving things be lets them turn out on their own. Both eggs in a basket&mdash;even the first one with its lack of spices and splattered egg&mdash;hit the spot. (Of course, that could be the beer talking).</p>
<p>I always choose breakfast for dinner for my late-night snacks. For one thing, all breakfast food is delicious. I could eat it for three meals a day and not tire of it. For late night, eating breakfast is almost like getting a head start on the following morning, when I will be coherent and there will be hot coffee. And I’m in my pajamas either way.</p>
