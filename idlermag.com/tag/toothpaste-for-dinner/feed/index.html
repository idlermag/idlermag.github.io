										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I asked my friends to suggest web comics the response I received was a little staggering. I had no idea they had been holding out on me like that&mdash;I hadn’t heard of at least half of the comics mentioned. I’m sure you’re all through the last bunch by now. Let’s while away our day together.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/001.html" target="_blank">Mark Doesn’t Understand Animals</a>. I knew about this one already. This comic has one joke and that joke is that Mark doesn’t understand animals. That’s it. Brilliant. This comic does not get old, friends. I read the entire archive every week or so and I laugh every time. This comic is also <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/035.html" target="_blank">really PG</a>. My 12-year-old sister loves it too. This comic has maybe me <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/021.html" target="_blank">want a bunny</a> like I have never wanted anything before. The only drawback is that is doesn’t update often enough for me.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/" target="_blank">Toothpaste for Dinner</a>. I’ve been reading <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/042211/leaning-back-in-chairs.gif" target="_blank">this comic</a> since college. The best use of your time with this comic is to click random because there are so many to look at. I don’t want you to get overwhelmed. I like this comic because the character is a lovable jerk and that’s how I like to view myself. “Tell us how you really feel” is something I hear at least once a day. <em>Toothpaste for Dinner</em> is written by Drew who also writes another one of my favorite comics, <a href="http://www.marriedtothesea.com/" target="_blank">Married to the Sea</a>. He’s married to <a href="http://nataliedee.com/" target="_blank">Natalie Dee</a> and has a mustache. <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/randomComicViewer.php" target="_blank">This</a> will keep you busy for about a week assuming you don’t sleep or shower (I know, no one sleeps or showers anyways).</p>
<p><em>Exploding Dog</em>. Do you guys remember expoldingdog.com? Really <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/everybreathyoutake.html" target="_blank">emo</a> <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/wishfors.html" target="_blank">pictures</a> you looked at in high school and totally related to? Well, it turns out they’re still awesome. The creator of <em>Exploding Dog</em> draws pictures inspired by the titles readers email him. Let’s all email him something awesome and sad and see who wins: <a href="mailto:sambrown@explodingdog.com">sambrown@explodingdog.com</a>. Going through a few these are mostly about <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/youllloveittrustme2.html" target="_blank">love and miscommunication and miscommunicated love</a>. <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/title/soonyoullbelikenew.html" target="_blank">Even the happy ones make me feel a little sad</a>, kind of like every song by Johnny Cash.             </p>
<p>Okay friends, these should keep  you from having to answer emails for about a week. You’re welcome.  This week’s winner is <em>Mark Doesn’t Understand Animals</em> because <a href="http://www.markdoesntunderstandanimals.com/018.html" target="_blank">he. just. doesn’t</a>.                </p>
