										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TV advertising and the insane amount of heart themed decorations at my local supermarché have notified me that Valentine&#8217;s Day has rolled around yet again. I’ve mentioned before <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/02/14/what-are-you-doing-for-valentines-day/">I don’t really care about this “holiday.”</a>  It might sound like I’m trying to be cool with the anti-Valentine&#8217;s Day attitude, but I seriously don’t think about it. Now, happily married (I’m really not trying to be a bitch about this if you’re Pro-V and single), Valentine&#8217;s Day just isn’t important. . . unless you’re going to go ALL OUT for it.</p>
<p>February of 1998 I celebrated Valentine&#8217;s Day with my high school boyfriend with the most clichéd date in the history of clichés.  We had a romantic (read: Italian) dinner at a local eatery, I was presented with flowers and a heart shaped box full of candy, and we went to the movies to see THE MOST craptastically romantic movie that ever wooed an entire generation of adolescent girls: <em>TITANIC</em></p>
<p>OH YEAH.</p>
<p>Cheesiest Valentines Day EVER. For me, anyway.  I was too young to get a marriage proposal from my true love on top of the Empire State Building after finding a ring in my champagne glass while a brass band played “All You Need is Love” with fireworks going off in the background and a fuck ton of white doves flying over our heads after an dinner where we shared a comically long spaghetti noodle while two Italian characitures serenaded us, so I settled for watching <em>Titanic</em>.  (This is what everyone was striving for in 1998, right?  I have no idea)</p>
<p>Anyway, this year I plan to top it.  Husband is in Moscow on this heartiest of days for a conference (it’s when the best miserable Russian weather is in season, really) and I’ll be home alone.</p>
<p>But, wait, I hear nobody say, how will you make Valentine&#8217;s Day cheesy with all sorts of love <em>sans</em> husband??</p>
<p>WITH EFFIN’ NACHOS, man!</p>
<p>A couple of dear friends and I are actively taking part in making Valentine&#8217;s Day cheesy  via <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/09/cheese-sauce-for-cheese-fries-and-nachos.html" target="_blank">a homemade cheese sauce</a> and watching anything and everything romantically ridiculous on Netflix and YouTube.  I’ll miss Husband, of course, but in his absence I really can’t think of anything more cheesy and beautiful than nachos and THUMBTANIC.*</p>

<p>Happy Valentines Day, everyone!  I hope <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItiIsEgC3Wc" target="_blank">all your thumbs go on</a>!</p>
<p>*Disclaimer: I did not discover &#8220;Thumbtanic&#8221; by myself.  I happen to be friends with some awesomely wacky people.</p>
