										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Occasionally, I read something that I know is intrinsically good, but I can’t quite figure out why it resonates with me. It’s not a common occurrence, but when it happens, I’m always left feeling a bit uneasy. Suffice to say, I’ve read a lot of comic books, and I can rush to judgment as fast as the next fan-man, but in the case of <em>The Underwater Welder</em>, I was left to ponder why it meant so much to me without clear explanation.</p>
<p>Published last year by Top Shelf Productions, <em>The Underwater Welder</em> is the latest graphic novel from Canadian writer/artist Jeff Lemire, author of <a href="https://idlermag.com/2013/01/10/from-last-to-first/"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a> and <em>Lost Dogs</em>, among other creative endeavors. One part ode to Rod Serling’s masterpiece of macabre fiction and another sweet tribute to the demands of fatherhood, <em>Welder</em> introduces us to Jack Joseph, a young husband and unconventional laborer, who continues to lament his father’s passing years before &#8212; even as his own son is nearing his entrance to the world. Having drowned in a diving accident on Halloween as Jack waited, dressed for trick-or-treating, the old man left his son with a steady emptiness as dark and expansive as the very waters he dives into day after day. But when a whispered voice comes through his pressurized helmet, and the image of a long lost watch catches his eye in the murky depths below him, Jack’s tenuous grasp on happiness begins to unravel.</p>

<p>The thing is, I’m not a father, impending or otherwise. I can’t sculpt Jack’s anxiety over his future responsibilities in my head any more than I can conceptualize welding pipes on the ocean floor. Nor &#8212; thank God &#8212; have I experienced the loss of my father, a scenario I believe cannot be truly understood until one has been forced to live through it personally. My dad is a phone call or an hour’s drive away, still nestled in the house I grew up in, despite my sisters’ and my attempts to convince him and my mom to abandon it for greener pastures. It rests still on the street where he taught me to ride a bike &#8212; still casting a shadow over the questionable vegetable garden we’d attempt for some years, although now vastly overgrown like a wild man’s beard. The rooms are much the same as when I lived there a million years ago, although the television is a lot nicer and the microwave a bit more advanced than that first one, a device which he referred to for years as &#8220;the devil’s tool.&#8221; Although my bedroom has long since been converted into a den, the holes I put into the wall, with posters my dad would roll his eyes over, are still gouged out in the wood paneling. There were plenty of shouting matches reverberating through those rooms over the years &#8212; as there is little question from whom I inherited my propensity for argument &#8212; but they are still far outweighed in my memory by more pleasant father-son fellowship. By all accounts, that trauma which propels Jack, I just don’t have. And yet, his story still weighs on me.</p>

<p>Eerily normal upon first appearance, Lemire’s depiction of Jack’s surging mania initially takes the form of dreams, childhood memories creeping into his thoughts as he drifts in and out of consciousness. A warm bath becomes the ocean once again, pulling Jack toward his father’s memory like an oxygen tether, reinforcing how much an enveloping comfort those depths have become to him. Nothing else on earth takes up as much space and yet feels as empty as water. Nothing wraps itself around you like a comfort, but still leaves you shivering, like the ocean. It’s both reassurance and source of enigma to this man who can’t rationalize his trauma, and eventually the pressure gets to be too much. Time flips between then and now, boyhood and manhood, and when he finally goes back in search of what’s lost, his entire world disappears. Now truly alone, Jack is left to wander the empty streets of the Nova Scotia town, a literal embodiment of his father’s missing presence decades hence. It’s a bleak vision Lemire leads Jack into, an end of the world only populated by memory, that cuts to the center of what it means to relive the past like it were still a fresh cut.</p>
<p>My memory, however shady it gets year after year, is firmly of a dad who was around all the time &#8212; coaching the baseball team I secretly despised, attending every swimming meet I had to push hard to earn even seventh place in, asking why I was still up studying at all hours when he’d come down to the kitchen for a midnight yogurt or three. He was the first person to my side in the middle of the night when I had a seizure that (although never repeated) scared ten year-old me out of my mind, and immediately accepted my coming out like I was telling him I preferred hot dogs to hamburgers. The only camping trip he ever missed was the week he was hospitalized after blowing up a house &#8212; an occurrence, combined with my own travails with fire, which still makes my husband unwilling to let me touch our furnace. He took the hit to drive me 12 hours each way to visit the college I’d end up attending, that I loved and he could barely afford. He even suffered my inexplicable disinterest in Niagara Falls and the subsequent awe I expressed at the Uniroyal Giant Tire along I-94 on the road back. There’s not a lot of absence I can associate with my father, who, like his own father, worked hard to give me everything he could so that I could have everything that I wanted. And yet, oddly enough, his memory of all that presence, by his own admission, isn’t as sure as mine. How can his reflection of the past not overlap so neatly with mine?</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10934" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/02/07/just-beneath-the-surface/welder3/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder3.jpg" data-orig-size="640,516" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Welder3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder3.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder3.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder3.jpg?w=640&#038;h=516" alt="father&#039;s face" width="640" height="516" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10934" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder3.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=121 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=242 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, Jack’s desperation for resolution leaves him more distanced from the world than ever, and only a desire to change &#8212; to fulfill for his life what his father couldn’t &#8212; brings him back among the living. Lemire’s lyricism of prose as Jack moves through the empty town, reliving his dad’s last day, is frankly only surpassed by the beautifully somber quality of line he gifts every panel with. Deep wrinkles scar Jack’s face as he confronts his own image, and realizes the time has come to leave the ghosts of the past behind. The expression of his sadness is matched by an exuberance of joy when his son is born and the future comes flooding forward like a wave off the sandy shore. It’s hard not to share in Jack’s tears, at both ends of his journey, as Lemire packages all of his pain and hope, heartache and fear, into an elegant presentation &#8212; all the more impressive in its simplicity and solitude. This novel, like childhood with its blend of imagined and real memories, stands as a great testament to a father’s fears and a son’s shortcomings, as much as it can the reverse. And therein lies its resonance for me.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10935" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/02/07/just-beneath-the-surface/welder4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder4.jpg" data-orig-size="640,1464" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Welder4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder4.jpg?w=131" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder4.jpg?w=448" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=1464" alt="message in a bottle" width="640" height="1464" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10935" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder4.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder4.jpg?w=66&amp;h=150 66w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/welder4.jpg?w=131&amp;h=300 131w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>It’s not at all that I am in search of my father, but that, to this day, he remains earnestly in search of me. I am likely the distance I don’t locate in our shared memories. I’m not the most forthcoming of his children, arguably the most removed despite my proximity, but I do remain most like him in all the ways that matter. Sure, I retain much more hair (so far) and chose a far different path toward building a family than he, but his lessons to me about responsibility, working hard, and doing what’s right for yourself no matter whether there’s money or admiration to be gained, all still lie just beneath the surface of my daily decisions. My dad continues today to dive in and seek me out, no matter how many eyebrows I raise about his repeated brushes with poison ivy or how hard I snarked when he told me he found marijuana growing on his porch. (P.S. It wasn’t marijuana. How do I know? Because I live in the world.) My dad, like Jack, hears my whispers even when I’m not actually there to utter them, and time. . . that’s the glimmer that catches his eye despite the sparks and pressure that frequently envelop us. And yet, he keeps diving.</p>
<p>That I should let myself be found a little more often is the least I can do in reply.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Happy Birthday, Dad!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s amazing how much we want to see ourselves reflected in the animal kingdom. From horoscopic astrological signs to Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em>, we seem to desperately want to understand humans by terms of bestial natures and vice versa. We ascribe personalities to all manner of animals &#8212; from those snooty giraffes at the zoo to my own snooty cat at home &#8212; imagining all sorts of motivations and inner turmoil behind their cool, voiceless exteriors. We want to elevate them out of comfort or fear, to make them seem less alien, less other to what we already understand. Indeed, if the animals around us were motivated by compassion, greed, kindness or guilt, we could predict their behavior as we attempt to understand our fellow man’s. </p>
<p>In 1968, moviegoers were treated for the first time to what has likely become the quintessential representation of man’s inhumanity to man (by way of the animals) in the epic <em>The Planet of the Apes</em>. The film depicts a post-apocalyptic world where humans have been reduced to the status of beasts and apes alone have been elevated to rule the planet. Civilization long gone, the apes are a warrior class who live a life much closer to nature than we did prior to the fall. Hills were adorned with simple adobe huts, as horses became the chief method of transportation once again. Rudimentary scientists were often pushed aside by the ferocity of politicians and military leaders, as the basest nature of our culture was imagined to be overtaking our most philosophical and free-thinking sides in the form of this terrible new future. And amid all this change comes one man to challenge it all, the last remnant of a culture long gone.</p>

<p>A powerful parable for our own contentious culture of the 1960s, <em>The Planet of the Apes</em> would go on to inspire countless works of art and sequels to its revelatory ending &#8212; but none so intriguing as that proffered by comic book legend Jack Kirby just a short time later. Debuting from DC Comics in 1972, <em>Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth</em> was part of a wave of work Kirby returned to DC to write and draw after many years crafting the heroes of the Marvel Universe. Emerging from an underground bunker (quite literally named “Command D”) after the events of a nebulous “Great Disaster,” Kamandi discovered a world far different than those described on the film reels and printed records archived by his grandfather. In one of the first panels of the series, the last boy floats above a submerged New York City, with the Statue of Liberty (star of the final moments of <em>Apes</em>) leaning into the darkened sky once again as a symbol of all mankind has lost. While undoubtedly a brazen homage, Lady Liberty serves another function in Kirby’s vision of the future &#8212; she introduces a world where <em>The Planet of the Apes</em> left off &#8212; with wider screen action and more bombastic creativity than filmmakers of the days before CGI could ever have dreamed. </p>
<p>No simple ape culture rules this savage planet with deadly radiation coursing through its veins, but rather any number of animal fiefdoms carve out the surface of this world. Apes are joined on land by lions, tigers, and bears, while irradiated crabs and sharks terrorize the seas. Kirby’s world is virtual menagerie of opposition to the sole remaining boy whose intelligence and honor rule over the savagery and mindlessness of the rest of his kind. Kamandi, last boy or no, is the brightest example what it means to be human &#8212; a pure swashbuckling hero, greeting adventure with a grin and inspiring hope in a world gone completely mad. Like so many of Kirby’s original creations in decades of creative work, Kamandi leaps across the page in blocky bold form, as if every muscle were a fist in itself busting through the comic frame. He wants to bring order to the chaos, regain control and return the earth as near to what it once was on those film reels as could still be possible. He is our last, great hero doing battle against the vilest instincts we re-attribute to our furry friends, and we are meant to wonder at the superiority of man to conquer all that means to bring us low.</p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>Kamandi</em> represents more than just man’s triumph over his own failures, however. Kirby’s work (some feel his best in a career of unmitigated genius) is also a time capsule of our own understanding of a vision of the world that still reflected unconditional dominance &#8212; of nature and our own destinies. Forty years later, the Western psyche is no longer so unequivocally bold, having since witnessed up close the devastation of war and begun to take note of nature’s unwillingness to completely bend to our will. It’s not uncommon to imagine Mother Earth taking her vengeance upon us for the damage we have wrecked upon nature, no matter how many politicians wish to debunk the science behind the belief in global climate change. We are a culture more divided than ever by contrasted ideologies, personal violence and alarming sense of inhumanity toward those around us. No surprise, then, that our understanding of one impending apocalypse be turned completely upside-down by yet another visionary comic book, the gloriously thoughtful and delicately beautiful <em>Sweet Tooth</em>.</p>
<p>First published by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics in 2009, and ending its forty-issue run as I write these words, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> is the tale of humanity dying from mysterious plague while new animal/human hybrids begin to appear, born in their place. Like <em>Kamandi</em> decades before, the series is the product of a singular visionary in Jeff Lemire, Canadian writer and artist. Unlike Kirby’s tome, though, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> focuses not on the last boy on earth, but on the first boy of a new breed &#8212; Gus, a nine-year old deer/human hybrid &#8212; and his relationship with a man who threatens, but ultimately protects, him amid danger and chaos of a brave new world.</p>

<p>Gus is a unique blend of cultural innocence and moral fervor, having been raised in the isolation of the Nebraska State Wilderness Sanctuary until his father finally succumbed to the so-called hybrid plague. Highly literate, unlike many hybrids spontaneously born to normal human parents, Gus lived his life until meeting the man Jepperd with a fairy tale perception of the world outside the woods. Once embarking on a trip toward “The Preserve,” a safe haven for this new breed of beings, Gus encounters a world far more threatening and violent than he could have ever imagined. Once Jepperd trades Gus to a group of military scientists intent on dissecting the young man to discover a cure for the sickness killing everyone around them, it becomes clear to Gus that no human can be trusted, that evil, in fact, rests in their very souls.</p>
<p>It’s only in Jepperd’s conscionable return to rescue Gus &#8212; and Gus’s own brush with the necessity of violence to save his friend’s life &#8212; that we begin to experience human (or hybrid) nature as it truly is. Good and evil are a choice we make in the world, and no one’s inherent character is decided by their genetic make-up or species. But while it may be in our power to make that choice, the consequence of choosing a world of violence has repercussions that remain unavoidable. As the remaining humans become more and more desperate to destroy Gus and his friends, the inevitability of their deserved demise becomes ever more clear. If <em>Kamandi</em> is a parable of man’s ability to conquer his own destiny, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> may very well be that of man’s ability to seal it.</p>

<p>As if to define that difference, however subconsciously, the artist delivers a depiction of his characters and their environment completely opposite in style to that of his spiritual forefather Jack Kirby. No less genius (challenge me if you will, old school comic fans), Jeff Lemire is crafting, panel after panel, the most delicate of line and softest of color palette &#8212; as if to represent so splendidly throughout the series a tenuousness to Gus’s livelihood and safety. Not unlike Kirby, there is a rough-around-the-edges quality to Lemire’s depictions, but it veers towards a naturalistic, nearly rural quality, while Kirby’s style always seemed to represent the larger than life. No, Gus and Wendy and Bobby (oh dear, sweet Bobby) find their emotional power in a meekness that radiates pure, unfiltered goodness and their world is poetically beautiful, even in its extremity and horror. Weariness for a world that is quickly passing away lines Jepperd’s face, and ultimately that of Gus, as we discover the choices that lead to the end of life track upon their very bodies and spirits. And even in those early days, when the risk of death drew near, one cannot help but marvel at the lush, comforting magic of it all, grandeur existing even in the face of natural and human disaster.</p>

<p>As a modern philosophical take on the danger of impending apocalypse, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> remains one of my favorites for its heart-wrenching emotional honesty in an atmosphere of loss and restoration. In choosing to imbue the spirit of survival and righteousness not in humanity, but in this first boy of a new way of life, Lemire has captured a real sense of the vulnerability we now feel in regard to the environment and our own philosophical conundrums. As beasts of burden to our own damaging legacy, we now ascribe our buoyant dreams to that which may be less human, but seemingly ever more deserving of our hopeful projection than ever. In Gus we have a template for the best creature we can desire to become, and for quite possibly the first time, a genuine roadmap for how to achieve that goal &#8212; not through war or unyielding fanaticism, but through friendship, sacrifice, and, quite simply, love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d like to clear up a bit of a myth &#8212; you can actually follow either <em>Animal Man</em> or <em>Swamp Thing</em> without reading the other. Writers Jeff Lemire and Scott Snyder have clearly spent the first year of the two titles building a common world with a number of common elements and themes, but they each have their own plan. Together, the two titles considered together form a dark, rich tapestry, but they&#8217;re each outstanding titles on their own. You don&#8217;t have to read both <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em>, although I can&#8217;t imagine why you wouldn&#8217;t want to.</p>

<p>At first glance, Buddy Baker and Alec Holland don&#8217;t have much in common. Baker is a sometime actor and stuntman who has embraced his public role as Animal Man not just to fight crime, but to be an advocate for animal issues. He&#8217;s married with a son and a daughter, and while his acting career has never really taken off, he&#8217;s just starred in a little indie film which is garnering a some attention and even a hint of Oscar buzz. In the pages of <em>Animal Man</em>, there&#8217;s an ongoing contrast between the humble, salt-of-the-earth (I&#8217;m trying to avoid the phrase white trash) nature of the Baker family, and the way modern media occasionally intrudes on the story &#8212; the first page of the first issue of <em>Animal Man</em> is a faux interview with Buddy Baker from the deeply hip magazine <em>The Believer</em>, and most of the sixth issue consists of scenes from Baker&#8217;s indie film <em>Tights</em>, as viewed on Baker&#8217;s son&#8217;s smartphone while the family is on the run in their RV.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10625" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/28/521-the-varieties-of-horror/hollandconstruction/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg" data-orig-size="640,394" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="hollandconstruction" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=640&#038;h=394" alt="Alec Holland, contractor" title="hollandconstruction" width="640" height="394" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10625" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/hollandconstruction.jpg?w=300&amp;h=185 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Alec Holland, on the other hand, is a renowned plant biologist who in the first issue of <em>Swamp Thing</em> is working in construction. He&#8217;s recently returned to life after a lab explosion years ago to find not only that his wife wasn&#8217;t so lucky, but that he shares memories with a monstrous superhero animated by a force known as the Parliament of Trees using what they were able to salvage of Holland&#8217;s personality after his death. The Parliament now wants Holland to become their champion himself as they had always intended, and he feels the unwanted pull of that destiny in both his waking hours and in his dreams.</p>
<p>But for all their differences, Baker and Holland have one thing in common. Their lives have been shaped and directed by forces that are beyond anything they had ever imagined, and the first year of each of their titles can be read as an extended cinematic pull back shot. In every issue, the frame expands a little, revealing a world bigger, deeper, stranger, and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In the New 52, Animal Man and Swamp Thing are revealed to be champions (&#8220;avatars&#8221;) for the constantly battling forces of animal and plant life, known as The Red and The Green, both of which oppose the embodied force of death known as The Rot. In times of balance, each of the three forces keeps the others in check. If things were in balance, of course, we wouldn&#8217;t have much of a story, and both titles at the inception find themselves in a place where the way things are is far from the way things should be.</p>
<p>In <em>Animal Man</em>, artist Travel Foreman evokes this dislocation by creating a world of open, realistic but flattened spaces with bizarre, hyper-detailed intruders. (Steve Pugh largely takes over by issue #7, but maintains Foreman&#8217;s overall stylistic deisgn.) Buddy Baker and his family are pursued by a grotesque, distended group calling themselves The Hunters Three who can consume living beings and wear their skins. The Hunters are portrayed as occasionally struggling to fit within their assumed shapes, which become cartoonishly distorted when a hunter is distracted or fatigued. Nothing about the process is pleasant or pretty. &#8220;This will hurt very badly,&#8221; one of the hunters tells a victim as he is being eaten, &#8220;but I need your sssskin. . .&#8221;</p>

<p>The flatness of Buddy Baker&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; world is a vivid illustration of the new series&#8217; central revelation. While Baker has been empowered by the Red as the <em>de facto</em> champion of the animal world, he is only a placeholder. The untimely death of the Red&#8217;s previous avatar left them in need of a temporary replacement, so they granted some of the next avatar&#8217;s abilities to her father. Maxine Baker&#8217;s connection to the Red far exceeds anything Buddy Baker has ever experienced, and her nacent powers already far exceed his own. Maxine is also just four years old, and for all her power, far from able to protect herself from the Lovecraftian figures pursing her.</p>
<p>While Buddy Baker finds himself a smaller figure in a bigger world, a custodian more than a champion, then Alec Holland is precisely the opposite, the champion who was taken from the Green and has now returned. Holland, however, wants nothing to do with the destiny the Green so fervently desires that he embrace, and he finds himself trying to prune back the tendrils the Parliament of Trees have wrapped around his soul. Fittingly, Yanick Paquette&#8217;s art is lush, flowing, and sometimes oppressively detailed. In the second and third issues, Holland meets a kindred spirit in Abigail Arcane, a woman whose family has a deep connection to the Rot, and who has a history with the Alec Holland simulacrum that was the previous Swamp Thing. Holland finds himself irresistibly drawn to Abigail, defending her life against both the Rot seeking to reclaim her, and the Green&#8217;s demands that he destroy her. </p>

<p>In different hands, we might have had two strong but unrelated titles, the interim hero and the reluctant champion with their very different stories in their own separate worlds. Linking the two together is a brilliant idea which has been executed with what I&#8217;m certain was no little effort and a great deal of skill. The star-crossed lovers and the father defending his progeny are both classic, even primal stories, but together they form a rich and unexpected epic about blood and family, and creating a future beyond what is encoded within history and genetics.</p>
<p>Because of this, <em>Animal Man</em> and <em>Swamp Thing</em> are comics about heroism and not just superheroes. Both titles have seen, groundbreaking work in the past (as written by Alan Moore and Grant Morrison, respectively), but they existed for all practical purposes in their own pocket narrative universes. With their New 52 incarnations, Snyder and Lemire have been able to bring themes (and a level of quality) more often found in indie comics or imprints like Vertigo to the mainstream DC universe. It&#8217;s an effort whose first fruits are just beginning to mature, but the ground is rich, and there&#8217;s the promise of even better to come.</p>
