										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>September 30th marked my last day working at the bookstore. Now I’m just preparing for baby and trying to work on editing my novel between naps. There are a lot of naps.</p>
<p>My first visit to the bookstore was the day after my last day. I had a huge stack of books to buy and had saved my pennies and sold some books I no longer wanted. Plus I missed everyone already and needed to see their faces. I also missed the stacks of books and all the shelves lined with stories I hadn’t read yet. Bookstores have always been a magical place where I could lose myself for hours just thinking of all the books I wanted to take home. Bookstores smell nice and the staff is smart. I was truly proud to be a part of my store’s 30 year anniversary party this fall. It’s become an impressive thing to have an independent store last that long in the book business.</p>
<p>Now it’s been nine days since my last day, 23 by the time this gets posted, and I feel like I’m floundering a little. I don’t know what the new releases are. I don’t know what new author Amanda is in love with or how far Dylan is in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (<em>Game of Thrones</em>) series. I don’t know the latest crazy customer story from Sue or how many times Allison has been hit on while shelving science fiction. Maybe she doesn’t even shelve that section anymore. I can’t confidently point out the location of the large-print section, it moves about five times a year, never settling into a true home. I haven’t seen Donna’s beautiful fall books display and I have no idea what new humor or fiction books are showcased at the register. I know I could drive there and find out, but I used to just know. I spent hours absorbing books and now that’s over.</p>
<p>A quick look at most of my bookshelves at home can remind me that I have plenty of books here that I haven’t read yet. Much to the chagrin of my ex-coworkers I do not shelve my personal collection in alphabetical order. Some shelves contain only my favorites. One shelf was all science fiction but now it has plays and a couple classics thrown in. Mostly I want the books to look pretty. Yes, they are for reading, but one of the reasons I don’t simply download books onto my iPad is because I like the way they look on a shelf. And stacked on tables. And lined across the mantle. And sometimes left to sit in bags for a week because I don’t have room for the new batch. </p>
<p>It’s still difficult not to buy new ones. I won’t have the daily temptation of beautiful covers or intriguing titles but I’ll also have less money to spend on books. I know I’ll still look through the used books and the sale books every time I visit the bookstore. I need to keep up-to-date on new books coming out. I had to find out that Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biography came out through <em>The Daily Show</em> like a commoner instead of seeing it on a cart in the back room a week ahead of time. I’ll have to follow through on my cousin Elizabeth’s suggestion and start visiting my library too. Although there can be a wait to borrow the most popular titles it is cheaper, so long as I can remember to return the books on time, not something I’m great at.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in which I’m huge and don’t really want to leave the house, I need to remember that I haven’t read at least half of the books in my own home. Maybe that sounds odd to you, but working in a bookstore for three years gives you a lot of opportunities to buy books. All of my personal spending money went to books and coffee for those three years. I have at least a hundred receipts for books filed away. I have galley copies from authors I had never heard of before taking the book home because maybe someday I might want to read it. Free books are hard to pass up. I have my husband’s science books that I made him buy with his own money but that I plan on reading too. And now we have kids books added to the mix. The baby needs his own bookcase and he isn’t even born yet. </p>
<p>Maybe this winter while it’s bitterly cold and I don’t want to leave the house, I’ll start at the top of one bookcase and read every book on that shelf, working my way through the entire collection. Then I’ll know what I want to keep and what I want to sell come spring. When warmer weather arrives I can unload the old at our used book counter, pick out a whole new stack to take home and line up prettily until I have time to read again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always been picky about when to buy and when not to buy a copy of a film. In the days before Netflix streaming, before Redbox and OnDemand, I would be so bold as to pick up a bargain bin film that I had never seen, but looked interesting. I am so old as to admit that that bargain bin film was probably on VHS, at least in the early goings. I lined my shelves. I bought previously-viewed films from the likes of Blockbuster and, showing my age even more, Mammoth video. Not only did I need to see everything, but I needed to display what I had seen like trophies.</p>
<p>Those days are long gone. Not solely because of the aforementioned home viewing options, but because I no longer have anything to prove. Recently, my wife even convinced me to put some of my DVDs away. Like, actually away. As in no longer in the line of sight. Growth is hard; growth is good.  My wife’s insistence that I stop burdening <em>all</em> of our living room shelves with my nerdom notwithstanding, I continued to purchase films, but with much more discernment. Instead of grabbing anything (and everything) I could, I made a point of only picking up films that inspired me, films with legitimate replay value, even if only in part. (I have been known to throw in a film just to watch one scene.) This new approach has made for a smaller, more purposeful collection. It’s also served to highlight my now seemingly archaic need to have something physical to reference.</p>
<p>In the age of streaming films and E-readers I still have shelves lined with DVDs and books. I had an easier time, I think, transitioning to an exclusively digital music collection because of my desire to have music with me at all times. CDs are cumbersome, an iPod is not. It’s been harder to make the transition elsewhere because, at least for me, the experience is as important as the thing itself. Books have a smell, a texture. In the completion of a page there is progress and physical evidence of it. I love bookstores. Love them. I could spend hours wandering the aisles of one, and have. Honestly, an E-reader just lacks character.</p>
<p>The same is true of film. Watching a movie that you chose (or in my case, settled on, watching only the first few minutes before wondering if I’d made a mistake, then choosing to give up on the idea all together) from an online menu isn’t anything. Busting out a copy of <em>Magnolia</em> intending to display and share in its brilliance, but instead ruining a party? Now that’s something. Going to a theatre? Now that’s even something-er. That’s an event. Even going to one of those dinosaur video rental places has got more going for it. At least you got off of the couch.</p>
<p>So I still have a ton of DVDs that I can’t yet bear to part with, even though some of them could surely go. I don’t really need an excuse to be lazy. I should get up and go to the movies, right? When I was a kid we used to walk ten miles through fifty feet of snow just to see a movie! Sometimes I feel old. Other times I worry that convenience will do away with the theatre experience the way that digital music has destroyed the album.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there’s any truism worth adapting to the pastime of reading comic books, it’s that a good shop is hard to find. Last summer, after several years of ordering my comics online, I decided it was time to go back to shopping locally. Sure, I was saving a few bucks by buying through a website, as many of us do for our cultural necessities. Truthfully, I’d grown used to getting that monthly package of books, most often the last Friday of the month — sometimes not until the following Monday. Those latter months were unpleasant, but I still managed to make do. I’d rip open that box and whip through the 30 or 40 books in a single weekend and then just wait around for the next shipment. <em>Tick tock.</em></p>
<p>Aside from evolving my reading habits into something more akin to binge eating, I had other factors to consider. I was planning on buying quite a few titles digitally as they became available on mobile app the same day as print. That would shorten my pull list for print comic books, and the economies of scale would undoubtedly start to fail me. I also missed the weekly routine. Most of my childhood was spent figuring out ways to get my parents to understand why it was SO IMPORTANT that Wednesday was the day they needed to drive me to the comic book shop. How was it not clear that Thursday is JUST TOO LATE? With so many new projects developing last year that started to respark that nervous, impatient, got-to-have-it-now feeling in me, I really had no choice but to find a brick-and-mortar comic book shop I could call second home.</p>
<p>The choice, however, was not as easy as one might suspect. Many parts of the United States, and indeed the world, have very few comic book shops, if any. I have met more than a couple readers that must drive over an hour to hit a store. Of course, I could never consider living in such a place. Then again, I also could not purchase a home that does not have a massive storage locker attached. I may be what you call a ‘special case.’ Chicago, fortunately, has the opposite problem: I drive within spitting distance of a dozen comic book stores on my 40 minute commute to work. Three are within walking distance of my house. So how to decide?</p>
<p>My shop &#8212; mine because I have now picked it, and therefore it should consider itself <em>mine</em> &#8212; is managed by a funny, articulate, friendly and smart lady. Let’s call her Shanna. And because her name is actually Shanna, that shouldn’t be weird. I picked Shanna’s shop when it became obvious to me that she possessed the two things I most appreciated in the world: she would be diligent about the accuracy of my pull list (!) and she would ensure my weekly visit didn’t feel like just another chore. I love bringing my comic books home every week, but I love stopping in my store to hear what else is happening almost as much. I talk to a lot of people on Twitter about comic books all week long, so I’m not entirely sure why it matters so much to me to hear what Shanna and her team think or are seeing or what they’ve read. But it really does. A recommendation from a live person, with whom you have face-to-face conversations and trust, oddly still matters in 2012. Who knew?</p>

<p>Image Comics’ <em>The Sword</em> is a recommendation I received from Shanna, when I asked her for a book she really enjoyed that might not be on my radar. Crafted by brothers Joshua and Jonathan Luna, <em>The Sword</em> introduces Dara Brighton, a college art school student living at home with her parents. Dara has been in a wheelchair for a few years, but in every other way seems to be living an unremarkable life. Her best friend Julie is a little badder than her (not too bad, though), she receives what every former art student understands as a glowing critique, and she still comes home for family spaghetti dinner after class. Stereotypically, the normalcy of suburban life changes instantly with a knock at the door during dinner. I can comfortably say, however, that’s where the clichés end.</p>
<p>Three strangers wielding strange powers claim to know Dara’s father, demand to know the location of a sword, and don’t stop asking until the house is in flames and everyone but Dara is dead. Her fate seems sealed as well until a beam loosened by the expanding fire falls, pulling Dara through the burning floor. Assuming a paraplegic to be doomed in these conditions, the mysterious trio leave the scene without finding the item for which they came. Dara would have been doomed, in fact, if she didn’t catch a glimmer of light on the unfinished basement floor. Grasping a silver handle just peeking out of the dirt, Dara’s body begins to magically heal itself from scratches, burns and even long-term damage, as she stands for the first time since she was 16 years old, sword in hand.</p>
<p>What follows is a revenge story that could easily have mimicked almost every super-hero origin ever written, and thankfully does not. The sword carries with it great power, having arisen from a complicated and mystical origin all its own, but it doesn’t bring to the bearer a glamorous life. Dara is quickly on the run, with Julie and one of her father’s students, from all manner of magical and authoritarian threats. The power Dara now possesses isn’t easily controlled, to somewhat gruesome results. Unsurprisingly, every horrific outcome adds to her desensitization and propels her determination to avenge what has happened to her family. This was never meant to be a bloody journey, but this blade is no mirror to the soul. If Dara ever thought revenge would bring back the peace of her middle American family life, her process for achieving it would have evaporated that possibility completely.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9410" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/12/speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-sword/sword2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sword2.jpg" data-orig-size="480,505" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Sword2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sword2.jpg?w=285" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sword2.jpg?w=480" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sword2.jpg?w=640" alt="somewhat grusome" title="Sword2"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9410" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sword2.jpg 480w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sword2.jpg?w=143 143w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/sword2.jpg?w=285 285w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>Jonathan Luna’s illustration of Dara never diverges from a matter-of-factness that underlines how normal and human a girl she really is. Grasping the sword heals her legs, but it doesn’t increase her cup size, volumize her hair, or inspire Dara to start wearing a bathing suit into battle. Tones throughout the book are pleasantly muted, and action is contained in small sequences, not splashed across double-page spreads. The art, on the whole, is very quiet, the perfect background for the very loud emotional turmoil running on every page. Every battle is obviously a struggle, and none of them are clear victories.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>The Sword</em> is precisely what I imagine would happen were one of my neighbors or fellow commuters to get great power they weren’t adequately prepared to receive. At her root, Dara is a prime example of how fascinatingly human comic book characters can be, if written well. The only catch is that in this case, her humanity is best illustrated not through compassion or heroism, but in the insidiously unavoidable nature for self-destruction most human beings possess, but don’t have the means to so colossally enact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk about this whole Amazon thing. </p>
<p>It’s difficult for booksellers to watch as online sales through Amazon take away from the profits of our stores. Music and movie stores already went through it, we know it’s not new. We know it’s not just us; Amazon sells everything. The recent coupon campaign wasn’t even available to use on books but Amazon still encouraged customers to go into our stores and send them information. It’s called crowdsourcing, paying a large amount of people a small amount of money individually to take on a big project. Amazon wants as much information about competitor pricing as they can get. It will probably give them the opportunity to raise their prices while still remaining below the prices of brick-and-mortar stores. And it sucks.</p>
<p>I read as many comments on Richard Russo&#8217;s recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/opinion/amazons-jungle-logic.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> as I could handle but all those people saying bookstores should lower prices to be more competitive drove me a little crazy. We have more expenses than they do. I know Amazon employs people too, but the cost of maintaining a storefront takes its toll. Our stores aren’t showrooms for something you can buy online. It hurts that Amazon already has a lion’s share of the marketplace but they still want to take away more of our sales. I like my job and I would like to see booksellers continue to have jobs in the future. And trust me when I say being a bookseller isn’t a lucrative business. I’m not sure how much the owners of my store bring in each year but I know that the number after the dollar sign on my paycheck is more adorable than impressive. I want to own my own bookstore in the not-too-distant future and I worry that I’ll never turn a profit.</p>
<p>But there is another side to this. I download music. I have a Netflix account and I use Hulu to watch television shows because we don’t pay for cable. My husband compares prices online before buying new electronics. He has purchased books directly from the publisher because they are cheaper than the ones where I work, even after my discount. So yeah, I feel a bit like a hypocrite when I ask people to buy a $30 hardcover when they can get it cheaper online or read it electronically.</p>
<p>I know technology is advancing. I know technology isn’t bad. Newspapers are moving online, magazines start out online; it’s easier for people to be able to get things from the comfort of their own home. I understand all of this. </p>
<p>I’m trying to wrap my head around my role in all of this. As a consumer in a mediocre economy I want to buy something at a good price. I want my adorable paycheck to go as far as it can. I also want to help improve the economy in my area. I want new stores to open downtown instead of driving past “for lease” signs. As someone who works in retail I want people to spend their money in my store. I’m tired of people saying they can just buy it online when I offer to order an item we don’t carry in the store. It’s exhausting to hear. I already know you can buy it online, please keep it to yourself.</p>
<p>I don’t know where bookstores will be in five years. I don’t know how many empty stores there will be in the mall where we are located. I don’t know how Amazon and other online stores will expand. I feel a little lost. And, inexplicably, a little sad. I like the books lining my walls and I wish other people did, too.</p>
<p>The truth is, we live in complex times. Most people are out for themselves, wanting to save money for their own families instead of thinking about the businesses they patronize. I know there are a lot of people who do care and think about the future of small businesses and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. </p>
<p>I wish we had the economy and the well-paying jobs to allow people to splurge on items they want instead of saving up for items they need. I wish I could say that if I ever get a novel published I won’t sell it on Amazon but I don’t know if I’m stubborn enough to follow through. I’m not a noble enough person to give my book away. I want to make money writing it. Just like Amazon wants to make money selling it.</p>
