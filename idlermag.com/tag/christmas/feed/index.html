										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the book world you can expect certain books to be published at certain times. January is full of self-help, diet, and exercise books for all those people making New Year’s resolutions. Summer sees loads of mysteries and an uptick in fiction for women, books about sisters and friends with images of women on beaches or in fields on the cover. I always felt that in the fall a lot of biographies and histories were published, kids need something to buy dad for Christmas. </p>
<p>Late November is the season for Christmas books. I’m not talking about holiday craft and recipe books, or books like the Mark Twain bio that are expected to be big sellers for the holidays. I’m referring to the romance and mystery books set in “Christmastime.” For romance books it’s a time when families and friends come together, experience some minor stresses, meet a handsome stranger or reencounter an old flame, and have everything end happily ever after. The mysteries generally have the main character’s attempt at happy holidays destroyed by murders and other crimes. </p>
<p>James Patterson’s Christmas book is one of his Alex Cross books, <em>Merry Christmas, Alex Cross</em>. The publisher’s description: It&#8217;s Christmas Eve and Detective Alex Cross is called away from his family to resolve a horrific hostage situation that is spiraling out of control. Really? Did this have to be set around Christmas? I doubt that the time of year plays into the plot much. Hostage situations with a Christmas tree or two, maybe some carols playing on a radio in the background. I feel like Patterson could have written a manuscript, realized the book would have a late fall release date and decided to throw in some Christmas related bits.</p>
<p>Romance writer Mary Balogh’s 2012 Christmas book is a republishing of two novellas, <em>A Christmas Bride/Christmas Beau</em>. This seems like a case of a publisher insisting the author have a new Christmas book so the author rummaged around in their older works for a few holiday stories. It frustrates me that people will buy anything Christmasy this time of year. Throw a red and green cover on a book and people will fall over themselves to buy it. Blue and white covers work too. Time to make money off the masses.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t call myself a Christian, the hyped up consumerism this time of year does bother me. I feel as though people will buy anything if they are told it will make their holidays brighter or happier. Generally the romance books are not purchased as gifts, from what I remember being in the book selling business. Women buy them to leave their real holiday stress behind and escape to snow covered Montana where handsome farm hands are home for the holidays and meet striking women, or sweet suburbs have twinkling lights and new neighbors who need a fall in love over a plate of gingerbread cookies. It’s not how Christmas really happens, although I suppose this feeling goes back to my general derision of romance novels in general. </p>
<p>The Christmas mysteries are purchased as gifts about as often as not. People seem to enjoy reading about CIA operatives and detectives running about trying to solve crimes and trim the tree at the same time. I’m not sure where the appeal is, murder around the holidays has to be more stressful than your average family get-together. Maybe people like reading about situations that make a lazy brother who “forgot” to get a hotel room or screaming nieces and nephews in matching sweaters a little less awful.</p>
<p>I will give a few exceptions to my general fussiness over Christmas books. Author Debbie Macomber seems to truly love Christmas. She has written a Christmas book every year since the late 1990s. It’s kind of adorable. Her website extolls her love of the holidays and writing the books is a tradition for her. She seems to have found a soft spot in my grinchy outlook. If someone loves this holiday season, I think it shows in their work. Richard Paul Evans seems to have an understanding of the holiday spirit as well. You’ve probably heard of his books, <em>The Christmas Box</em>, <em>The Timepiece</em>, and <em>Lost December</em> to name a few. He has written a Christmas book every year for the past decade or so as well. He has the feel good market well covered.</p>
<p>Even these books make me roll my eyes a bit. Why can’t they take place during other times of the year? Why does winter have to equal Christmas? It’s exhausting. I don’t want to be a Grinch, but the forced holiday cheer gets to me, especially when it starts immediately after Halloween. Thanksgiving gets a small window to shine and then it’s buy buy buy. Christmas books feed into this frenzy of holiday craziness and that puts them on my naughty list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s strange to string up Christmas lights around a window framing palm trees and sunshine, instead of cloudy skies and snow. Listening to Christmas music on Pandora just felt like a sham. I wonder how parents in San Francisco justify Santa’s sleigh. There’s nothing for his runners to skate over in California but fresh asphalt and no woods in which grandma gets run over. Santa would have to whip his reindeer through Golden Gate Park and mow down dispassionate hipsters instead.</p>
<p>It’s just started to get chilly enough at night to leave frost in the morning, so I decided to celebrate my lack of seasonal affective disorder by making my mother’s homemade chicken and dumplings soup. my family normally spends Christmas Eve at my grandparents’ house, where my grandma cooks three different pots of soup (chicken noodle, chili, and clam chowder). We fill up on crackers and cheese and vegetables beforehand, but we eat two bowls of soup anyway. My grandfather is doing well, but he’s still recovering from surgery and needs to rest, so we’re giving my grandmother a break.</p>
<p>Instead, I wanted to create my own mini-Christmas. If chicken soup cures your sickness, chicken and dumplings soup is the effing elixir of youth. Not only do you have the warm broth and spices, but you have the soft, chewy dumplings. I’d prescribe this for most illnesses—heart, mind, body, whatever.</p>
<p>There’s no link to send you because this is a recipe I actually have written down on a card, in my mother’s handwriting, ending with the word “Yummm!” and a smiley face. I’d share it with you, but I don’t have my mom’s permission and frankly I’d like to keep it to myself. I’ll be coy with the details instead. This will be my only Grinchy moment, I promise.</p>
<p>First, I chopped up chicken, broccoli, carrots, and celery, and added them to a broth with cream of celery soup, some cloves and bay leaves.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was a little disappointed in the simplicity of the recipe. I’ve never watched my mother cook it, but I assumed she threw a bunch of ingredients together—a pinch of this and that, and it somehow came out perfect. Maybe this is part of getting older and realizing that your parents are actually people, but instead of thinking about it too hard, I put a lid on the broth to simmer.</p>
<p>I measured all the ingredients for the dumplings and stirred them into a bowl, then reread the recipe. I was supposed to have mixed the dry ingredients, then added the liquid ones. As usual, I immediately assumed the recipe would be a disaster and went about huffily mixing the dough, though I wondered what was even the POINT, now that it was ruined.</p>

<p>Next, the recipe told me to drop the dumplings into the spoon by the tablespoonful. I’d never learned the physics of dumplings, but I’d assumed they would drop in doughy little balls to the bottom of the pot. Not so. All the dumplings floated on the surface of the broth like Michigan’s winter cloud cover. I couldn’t even see the broth. How were they going to cook if they weren’t even sitting in the broth?</p>

<p>At this point, I wanted to call my mom and cry a little bit over my dumplings and make her promise me lots of Christmas chocolate in my stocking, but it was 11 p.m. in Michigan. After keeping an eye on the expanding dumplings for ten minutes, I turned the heat down, smushed them down with the pot lid, and let it cook.</p>

<p>After only a few minutes, I heard a sizzle from the stovetop, meaning the pot had boiled over. I love having an electric stove for all reasons but this—as soon as you spill something, it burns to a crisp on the hot surface and starts smoking and smelling all sorts of terrible. Even with my slight phobia of burning things, I wasn’t entirely surprised. What more was to be expected from doomed dumplings? I switched burners, turned on the fan, and waited a few more minutes.</p>

<p>Somehow, the dumplings cooked. Those that had been pushed to the bottom of the pan were a little doughier, those at the top were fluffy. I couldn’t imagine how that had happened, when most of the dumplings seemed to be above the broth’s surface, but I didn’t question it and ladled out two bowls. As a kid, I used to fill my bowl with more dumplings than soup, and my mom’s recipe had the ideal ratio, with a bite of dumpling for every spoonful. As usual, if I listen to my mom, everything will turn out okay.</p>
<p>I’m writing this from a plane, watching the red rock terrain change to snowy Rocky Mountain peaks, which shrink into plains where Santa would have no sleigh problems. I wish you warmth and a full belly for the holidays and the new year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You had to know it was coming. Jimmy Fallon hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em> the WEEK before Christmas? You had to know that the show, at some point, would feature the wacky little ditty &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas.&#8221; Many years ago the number, written by Fallon and Horatio Sanz, was premiered before the 30 Rock crowd. The original has become a classic in the realm of silly little <em>SNL</em> memories. <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/18/i-wish-it-was-christmas/">The version we linked to on this site last year</a> was NOT <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/HORATIOS-CHRISTMAS-TREAT/1185577" target="_blank">the original</a> but a different version. I remember seeing one in a warm month, or at least a spring month, clamoring for the season to arrive.  And so as I watched <em>Saturday Night Live</em> I waited and was rewarded with the 2011 version of that very first sketch. All four players were there from the original: Sanz, Fallon, Chris Kattan (looking waxy), and Tracy Morgan. They played the song, Morgan did his dance, Kattan whipped his head and almost dropped the keyboard, the audience reacted to the sketch as a classic. And it is, the song is a classic, but the version from last week was not THE version. No, there is another version, a version that I have written about before, a version that rests on top of the mountain of Christmas music.</p>

<p>Ever since taking over the slot vacated by Conan O’Brien, Fallon has been creating a fun, funny, and crafty late night show. His show feels young and fun, something that always seem to brew at 12:30 at night on NBC. The irreverence is grounded by a likeability that you really sense when you see him on TV or on these commercials. The show is fun and he seems dedicated to Christmas and the season. Surf over to Hulu and keyword search Fallon and Christmas. 12 Days of Christmas Sweaters, Drunk for Christmas, etc. The man loves the season. Two year ago I happened upon the show and hear the sound of Don Pardo (or a sound alike) introducing a gift from Late Night. Out came Fallon and Horatio Sanz, in matching sweaters, and began to play the song. One minute in the song builds, the band takes off and Julian Casablancas takes over, all the elements creating an environment of pure enthusiasm and pure happy energy. The song, in reality, isn’t much lyrically, but it magically transforms into something greater in this setting. Casablancas had released a recorded version of the song in conjunction with his solo debut, this version kills his first version.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wS-k66MKgs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Last year I wrote about the song, about the way it makes me feel and the way it makes me feel whenever I hear this version with Fallon &amp; Sanz &amp; Casablancas. It combines the gentle majesty of the season with the enthusiasm of the participants and the absolute enjoyment of the crowd. As the time has passed since last year I think this song, this version, is the greatest Christmas song of all time. Why? It is the most modern, for one. Sure everyone puts out a disc of Holiday tunes for the season, these are more likely than not a collection of classics with a new spin. The majority of traditional Christmas songs were modern in the 40s and 50s, when the season was probably incredibly magical and paced well. Think of Michael Corleone shopping and finding out about his father in the first Godfather film. To me, that is the feeling of Christmas that those songs reflect. The rush that captivates and motivates us all nowadays ruins what should be a nice, reflective time of year. Some Christmas music is timeless, the <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/25/1-christmas-music/">Charlie Brown Christmas LP</a> is one of the greatest complete set of Christmas music you could ever hope to have. Soft, brilliant, cheerful, devotional, yet completely engaging. That disc sounds like snow on the ground, the first snow you see, no footprints, not even from squirrels or other animals. Pure, white fields of joy under a beautiful cold blue sky.</p>
<p>The Fallon song is modern and yet it says nothing of the modern lives we lead and the crush of desire many feel at the holidays. It alerts that the season is simple and joyous and within reach whenever we need to feel simple and joyous. It is not materialistic it is excited and eager and within those emotions we too can remember those feeling and emotions.</p>
<p>I am a parent now; I have two small (in terms of age) children. I want their memories to Christmas to be driven by snow, stars, lights, and a rush of good cheer that will last until the kids are the age I find myself. The holiday season is brief, it can be rough, and events that transpire at this time of year, good or bad, will remain with you for your remaining days.  Remember that life, while bleak in points, is beautiful. Really it is. You don’t know how many more sunrises you will see, nor how many more Christmastimes. Allow yourself the chance to slow down and appreciate what makes the Holiday season magical for you now and for you when. And never forget those feelings.</p>
<p>Here is my War Against Chrismas Music mix for 2011. It ends, as last year’s ended, on Jimmy Fallon’s &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas Today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all the time that I worked in a record store there was generally one genre of music that we never really looked forward to playing: Christmas Music. Well, that isn’t really true. There were lots of things we never looked forward to playing and rarely did, but Christmas music always felt like such a loaded genre to sift through.</p>
<p>You generally would get Christmas releases in early to mid-November, peaking around the week after Thanksgiving and then just stumbling and selling until Christmas, at which point you either slashed the prices of the music or returned it all on Boxing Day.</p>
<p>When I worked in the mall store there were a few people who liked Holiday Music (I think). Either that or they just played the music to corner the market on being annoying. I recall one fine day in early November coming out of the back room at lunch and hearing the unmistakable strains of Christmas music on the overhead. I asked my idiot assistant manager a simple question, “What the hell?” He lied in response, pinning the choice on the General Manager. I asked her the next day about this statement and she denied it. Such was the volatile nature of Holiday Music. Used to be that the music would make its way onto store stereos around Thanksgiving. I don’t know when the process became so accelerated but go into any Meijer the week of Halloween and you see the Christmas items seeping into the store. Heck, I stopped in a Walgreen’s on the way home from work and looked up in the overstock to find oodles and oodles of Christmas things. </p>
<p>At the record store we picked and chose the Christmas music, fun things to accentuate the very nature of a record store where you would shop at to experience new music. At the bookstore, the sounds would be on eight hours a day and into the night. On the two nights I worked we stopped the Christmas tunes at 6pm and we had a good five hours of quality, fun music to give everyone in the store a break from the growing tsunami of frenzied shoppers.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I actually got out of retail that I began to feel a bit of peace with Christmas and the holiday season. No longer putting up with lines, trying to find parking, and trying to keep the latest middle-of-the-road title on the shelves, Christmas returned to being a quite lovely coda to the year. Once my kids were born, it changed again. Now it seems almost too fast what with there only being three December weekends before the big day, but seeing your own children at Christmas rekindles all the warm memories of your own youth &#8212; waking up at 3am on pure adrenaline, the rush of seeing presents that simply weren’t under the tree when you went to bed. As a parent now I want my children to have those memories and associations without being swept up in the mindlessness of consumerism and general greed that feels prevalent in the season. Of course, complaining about consumerism at Christmas is about as new as Tony Bennett’s hairpiece. Watch the epic, fantastic <em>Charlie Brown Christmas Special</em>. One of the main underpinnings of the story is the way that Christmas had gotten so COMMERCIAL! Folks, those feelings were evident to the people creating that TV show FORTY-SIX YEARS AGO. </p>
<p>I wonder, with the advent of the internet and the ability to do almost everything without leaving your home or interacting with people will eradicate the yearly PTSD many retailers suffer. Smaller stores will continue to dry up and fade away while people die and are tear-gassed at big box stores hoping to saving an extra few dollars on an HDTV, dollars that they probably should either save or spend on something they need, like food or medicine.</p>
<p>I’m not here to get on a soapbox. I am here to offer an antidote to the mindless and vapid Christmas music you hear if you step outside your box at all these last weeks of the year. Last year I used today’s new-fangled technology to update the way I delivered my Christmas CD that I used to send out to friends. I put a bunch of fun Christmas Music together, spurred on by my love of the song &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas Today,&#8221; mixed it all together in GarageBand, and uploaded it to SoundCloud. I wanted to do the same thing this year.</p>
<p>Folks, it wasn’t easy finding the time to do this! But by golly I did it! Please take the time to listen to the stream, download the music, put it on your iPod for the drive or burn it to a CD. I am trying to re-upload last year’s mix (I had to tweak it slightly-the opening track was somehow flagged – I guess the family of Lawrence Welk monitors SoundCloud) for you to also dig into; there are only two songs that repeat, songs I couldn’t not put on the mix. If you want a track list email me, but I would rather hope that you downloaded the song and just sat and listened and enjoyed the journey. The way we listen to music has been on my mind lately and I want this mix, all 53 minutes of it, to be listened to like it was 46 years ago and all the distractions that we live with gone. So listen to the music, stay tuned in the coming weeks for a few discussions of my favorite Christmas music and music that you should be listening to as well.</p>
<p>And remember to slow down, take the time to enjoy the month of December. You only get so many in your lifetime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holidays are a time for spending time with your family (if you like them), or trying to get out of spending time with your family (if you don’t), a time for resting, and most of all, a time for eating. If you’re a grown-up like me, the holidays are also a time of obligation. (Have I gotten older and jaded? Probably.) If you read my blog a few weeks ago about <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/20/on-not-eating-chocolate/">my chocolate bar binge</a>, you’ll remember that I received lots and lots of goodies in my office. When I started getting all the cards and gifts and the chocolate, it occurred to me that I had almost been at my job a year. One of the girls who had only been there a few months had passed out chocolate mints. Drat. I was an adult. I’d have to bow to obligation.</p>
<p>I’ve already lamented the fact that handing out healthy snacks is a good way to get one of my coworkers to slap me. I still really want everyone to like me, so decided to swallow my guilt with a cookie chaser instead of crying about calories. At first, I wanted to look for some sort of cranberry oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, but I found a list of the 10 best holiday cookie recipes on the Food Network’s website and became enamored with Giada de Laurentiis’s recipe for <a target="new" href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/lemon-ricotta-cookies-with-lemon-glaze-recipe/index.html">Lemon Ricotta cookies</a>.</p>
<p>I started to panic a little that my coworkers would think I was stupid&mdash;lemon doesn’t exactly bring to mind images of snow and mistletoe. What kind of girl makes Christmas cookies without chocolate? But I decided that they had best be grateful they were getting anything at all with my budget, and I had most of the ingredients in my pantry already. I crossed my fingers that their taste buds would prove that lemon cookies are as Christmasy as Jesus and headed to the grocery store for some lemons and whole-milk ricotta cheese.</p>
<p>As with all recipes, I read the reviews first and made my decisions based on what the most intelligent-sounding reviewers said. Many recommended that I use the zest of three lemons instead of two. I thought that it was risky to over-lemon, but what’s cooking without a little risk? I bought three lemons. </p>
<p>The first part of the recipe called for me to whip together the softened butter and sugar, which was alarming because the mixture felt more like concrete and not something I should be going at with an electrical device. But it turned out nice and fluffy after all, and I ended phase one with a toned right bicep. Then I set to zesting the lemons. I’ve never done this before, and I think I might start doing it for fun in my spare time. It’s really tactile and pleasing, like playing with Legos or something, and I was forgetting that it was winter with the scent of lemons filling the kitchen. I thought this boded well for the cookies themselves, and that maybe people would enjoy a little bright lemon in the winter.</p>
<p>The recipe told me to put the cookies on parchment paper, which I’d never used before. We had a roll of it in a drawer, but I pulled it out to discover that there was only enough for one cookie sheet. It was way too cold to go back outside, so I crossed my fingers and decided to use the one sheet for all the batches of cookies. The recipe called for 15 minutes of cookie time. That rang my internal fire bells. 15 minutes? I checked the cookies after 10, 11, and 13 minutes, but they took the whole 15 minutes to cook. I took the first batch off the parchment paper (which stayed mercifully ungreasy), and put in the second batch. </p>
<p>The kitchen was feeling rather cozy as I cleaned while the second batch baked and my roommate put on a pot of tea. I took the second batch out and started transferring them off the cookie sheet. I was rearranging the plate to make room when I smelled smoke. For a second, I did nothing. I have a bit of a kitchen phobia of setting things on fire, and I often think things are burning when they are not (for reference, read every post of mine ever). Then I heard a crackle. I turned back toward the stove, and the other burner had caught the parchment paper on fire.</p>
<p>I did the only logical thing. I yelled “Fire!” and took a big breath in, and blew on the flames. Like it was my birthday and my only wish was not to burn the house down. My breath blew ashes of parchment paper everywhere, but the fire was stoked and the flames got even bigger. My roommate ran to the sink and it took the sound of running water for me to remember what I was supposed to do. I ran the cookie sheet to the sink and dumped the flaming cookies and paper in. </p>
<p>Little bits of burned parchment paper floated to the ground while I decided whether or not to cry. Only two of the cookies were ruined, but I was out of parchment paper. I left the charred remains in the sink while I stuffed my arms into my jacket and angrily tied my shoes. In my schedule for the evening, I hadn’t budgeted time for catching the cookies on fire, so I ran to the grocery store. I actually ran, and used the self-scanner all red and sweaty, coming back into my house breathless while my roommate sipped her tea. If you’re wondering why there aren’t pictures of the disaster, it’s because my instinct is, apparently, to blow on a fire and then take a jog to the grocery store instead of photographing the disaster.</p>
<p>Back into the oven went the next batch, on brand-new parchment paper. I got the glaze ready, and brushed it on the cooled cookies. Then I wrapped them all up with cellophane and red ribbons. With the destroyed cookies, there was only one left for me to eat. And that turned out to be the real tragedy. They were light and lemony without being too sweet, with a bit of creaminess from the ricotta.</p>
<p>The next day, one of my coworkers came over to my desk and said they were the best cookies she had ever had. God bless us, every one.</p>

I mean, when one thinks about classic Christmas records, classic Christmas shows, how can you NOT think of this music? From this classic TV special, now 45 years old, we have Vince Guaraldi’s soundtrack to <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>. Everyone, everybody reading this on this site, has seen the show in question, grew up with Snoopy and the Peanuts on our TV screens and in our hearts. </p>
<p>I believe that Vince Guaraldi is the first encounter many people have with jazz music. While he is not an artist I would deem revolutionary I am a huge fan of Guaraldi, his sound and his works. I dig his work with Cal Tjader, his solo stuff, his Peanuts work, and his freakier stuff in the late 60s/early 70s. Guaraldi passed away after a club gig in 1976, leaving behind an unfinished body of work. I think he is best known for his Peanuts work but he does have more than just the sounds we are familiar with. </p>

The music is as familiar as the Little Debbie ads from the shows when I was a kid. What other Christmas music is so instantly soothing, instantly calm and peaceful? When you hear the music, you see the Peanuts, you see the snow, you see yourself as a child watching the program. Guaraldi’s style is soft, like footprints on snow, and it draws you in, makes you listen. </p>
<p>I cannot think of another complete LP of music that SOUNDS like Christmas, FEELS like Christmas, IS Christmas more than this soundtrack. Even in the uptempo moments, like &#8220;Linus &amp; Lucy&#8221; and &#8220;Skating,&#8221; the music is a celebration of the season. </p>
<p>What makes Christmas Christmas? What makes Christmas Christmas as a child? Presents, time away from school, fancy dinner and fancy breakfasts, snow, and the time spent with family. What makes Christmas Christmas as an adult? For me, now, it is the stillness of Christmas evening. The day is done, the lights are still on the tree but the mayhem and the anticipation are gone. It is quiet and it is still and it is beautiful. You can let your mind go, let your worries go, and embrace the bygone childhood feelings, feel your past as fresh as the present moment. </p>
<p>As a parent, Christmas is those things and more, as now you re-live your own memories and experiences of Christmas through the eyes of your children. Their excitement, their energy, their joy. As a parent you want to give them all that you had growing up. You want your children to feel about Christmas the way that you used to. If you are lucky, you will get to have grandchildren to experience it all again, the beauty of the cycle of things. </p>
<p>I want my children to love the holiday season, I want them to have the same kind of memories that I remember, the same experiences and emotions. During the season, on the weekend, when I play holiday music I play a few different things. But above all else I play the soundtrack to <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> by Vince Guaraldi. It is a record for the past, for the present, and for the future. It is a perfect gift in the truest sense of the word, a gift you can give every year that never goes out of style.</p>

<div style="width: 170px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" " title="Leg Lamp" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.geardiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/christmas-story-lamp-leg1.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="194" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mmmmm... Leg lamp</p></div>
<p>Odds are you’re at least somewhat familiar with Bob Clark’s holiday classic <em>A Christmas Story (1983).  </em>It usually starts airing sometime around the end of Thanksgiving and continues on through Christmas morning every year.  Seriously, it’s always on.  Because of this (and because it’s a pretty great Christmas movie) it has managed to worm its way into our holiday consciousness.  Nearly everyone remembers <em>something</em> about the film, if not its entirety.  Perhaps the “queen mother of dirty words”?  Or the triple dog dare that leads to poor Flick getting his tongue stuck to a flagpole?  The leg lamp?  Oh, that leg lamp.  It was kind of hot, no?  Ah, to be a kid again.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="Black Christmas" src="https://i0.wp.com/horrorsnotdead.com/images/black_christmas_74.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="315" /> <em>A Christmas Story</em> could be considered Bob Clark’s masterpiece, despite the fact that he gave us <em>Porky’s 1 &amp; 2 (1982 &amp; 1983) </em>in addition to starting his career on the high note that is <em>She-man (1967), </em>which is about a “soldier forced to take estrogen and wear lingerie after being blackmailed by a violent transvestite.”  They should show <em>that</em> every Christmas!  But <em>A Christmas Story</em> isn’t Bob Clark’s only foray into holiday territory.  In fact, it’s not even his first.  In 1974 Mr. Clark brought us a film that would help shape the slasher genre as we know it today: <em>Black Christmas</em>.  As a slasher film, it&#8217;s top notch, with scares that still hold up today.  As a Christmas film, well, that’s a matter of taste.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="The Eye" src="https://i0.wp.com/actionflickchick.com/superaction/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/black-christmas-the-eye.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="199" />A group of sorority girls are hosting a Christmas party when a deranged and disoriented man (not a frat member) climbs into their open attic window.  Soon they begin receiving creepy (super creepy) phone calls.  Some seem like inane babbling.  Some contain inhuman sounds.  The calls become increasingly threatening and bizarre, and it’s not long before the man begins creatively dispatching the girls one by one.  They’d be lucky to get a BB in the eye!  Speaking of eyes, that’s all you’ll ever see of this mouth breathing, Christmas-hating jerky boy.  Chilling shots of his lecherous eye peering through cracks and holes in the wall, lit with a spotlight.  Couple that with the calls and you’ve got the makings of one serious boogieman!  Ho, ho, ho. </p>
<p>Perhaps this year I’ll have a nice little Bob Clark Christmas?  <em>A Christmas Story</em> followed by <em>Black Christmas? </em> Or, if I’m ambitious, a bizarre, re-edited mash-up?  You Tube, here I come!</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>

<p>As a child I knew in a general-sort-of-way who Jack Benny was (because I was just that much of a dork), but I wasn’t really introduced to his work until I met my fiance, who listens to more old time radio than anyone else in this century. This has provided my crash-course in old-time radio and in the radio comedies, which ended up being the type of radio show I gravitated toward most. I don’t mean that all radio comedy is gold simply due to old-timey cred, because I discovered some that I can’t get into. <em>The Great Gildersleeves</em> is cute, but it’s not my thing. <em>Fibber McGee and Molly</em> kind of makes me want to put my eyes out like Oedipus Rex (or my ears, as it were, since this is radio). But with my fiance’s guidance in sifting through his OTR arsenal, I have come up with three programs that are as hilarious and engaging today as they were when they first aired: <em>Baby Snooks</em>, <em>The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show</em>, and <em>The Jack Benny Program</em>.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2445" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2445" data-attachment-id="2445" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/22/the-customer-is-always-right-and-this-jerk-is-a-customer/blanc-loses-it/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/blanc-loses-it.jpg" data-orig-size="467,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="blanc-loses-it" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/blanc-loses-it.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/blanc-loses-it.jpg?w=467" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/blanc-loses-it.jpg?w=300&#038;h=231" alt="Benny and Blanc" title="blanc-loses-it" width="300" height="231" class="size-medium wp-image-2445" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/blanc-loses-it.jpg?w=300&amp;h=231 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/blanc-loses-it.jpg?w=150&amp;h=116 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/blanc-loses-it.jpg 467w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2445" class="wp-caption-text">Jack Benny and Mel Blanc</p></div> They’re the same shows that are many people’s favorites, with <em>The Jack Benny Program</em> heading up the pack as the most well-known, with amazingly high-quality, snappy, classic comedy writing that transcends time and is still funnier than most sitcoms being made today. <em>The Jack Benny Program</em> transcended the death of radio too, when the entire show first made the big jump to television in 1949.</p>
<p>And, with good reason, probably the most well-remembered episode of the TV show is the absolutely delightful &#8220;Christmas Shopping.&#8221; The premise for the episode saw previous incarnations in radio-format and in earlier in the TV show, building up to the 1960 television version that is the best-realized embodiment of the script. In all versions and and especially in the 1960 TV one, comic genius Mel Blanc completely steals the show as the unhinged, put-upon retail clerk who has the misfortune of having Jack as a customer, and whose gradual unravelling is the pinnacle and highlight of the episode.</p>
<p><div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2443" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2443" data-attachment-id="2443" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/22/the-customer-is-always-right-and-this-jerk-is-a-customer/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big.jpg" data-orig-size="621,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-BIG" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big.jpg?w=621" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big.jpg?w=300&#038;h=231" alt="cracking up" title="jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-BIG" width="300" height="231" class="size-medium wp-image-2443" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big.jpg?w=300&amp;h=231 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big.jpg?w=598&amp;h=462 598w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/jack-benny-and-mel-blanc-big.jpg?w=150&amp;h=116 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2443" class="wp-caption-text">Benny, cracking up</p></div> Even if you think you don’t know who Mel Blanc is, you totally do: he was the voice of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester, Tweety, Barney Rubble and a veritable host of other cartoon characters. If there is such a thing as a cartoon voice-acting visionary it’s Blanc, who single-handedly pioneered the comedic voice style that still shapes cartoons as we know them today. Whether behind or in front of the camera it cannot be denied: he’s funny as hell. In &#8220;Christmas Shopping&#8221; you can clearly see Jack Benny covering his mouth as he tries not to laugh during Blanc’s abject sobbing. You can see also that Blanc sees this, and tries even harder to make his collaborator crack up.</p>
<p>Also in the episode is radio and classic-TV fan-favorite Frank Nelson, who is probably most-remembered now for many immortalizing parodies in old Looney Tunes cartoons, where cartoon-Nelsons utter his singular catch-phrase: “Yes?&#8230;” One word, and instantly recognizable.</p>

With a raspy voice due to vocal cords damaged as a child (from yelling loudly to sell newspapers), Anderson was the second-most popular character on <em>The Jack Benny Program</em> under Benny. Even though Anderson plays Benny’s valet, many consider the show advanced for its time in presenting Rochester as an intellectual equal to the other characters, and as more of a friend to Benny than an employee; both unusual things for an African American character in early television and radio. Benny and Anderson were close friends in real life and, particularly in the post-World War II world, Benny (who was Jewish) was extremely protective of Anderson, and fought against racist attitudes toward the actor on numerous occasions. Anderson became one of the highest-paid comedians at the time, black or white.</p>
<p>Benny himself, who was one of the early originators of self-deprecating humor, comes off as a much gentler comedian and man than many who worked in the same field. The son of Polish and Lithuanian immigrants, Jack Benny was born Born Benjamin Kubelsky and got his start in vaudeville like most everyone else at the time, later becoming a household name with one of the most popular radio/TV shows in history. The Jack Benny Program ran from 1932 &ndash; 1955 on radio and from 1949 &ndash; 1965 on television. When speaking of his fame, Benny once said, “Everything good that happened to me happened by accident. I was not filled with ambition nor fired by a drive toward a clear-cut goal.” Benny lived to be 80 even though his character never aged past 39. A generous man who played a miserly penny-pincher, Jack Benny arranged in his will for a single long-stemmed red rose to be delivered to his wife Mary Livingstone every day for the rest of her life. </p>

Do you remember when it started? I was walking through Meijer with my kids the other day, just as the store’s Christmas displays were going up. I said aloud, to nobody in particular, “When I was younger Christmas was in December.” An older couple was walking in front of us and they heard me, I could tell in their body language and the slight smile as the husband looked at his wife. It was the last week of October. </p>
<p>When I think about Christmas, I think about silence. When I was younger there was stillness to the season. You felt removed from reality, isolated. No broadband, no wireless devices. Presents. Snow, if you were lucky. Darkness, fire in the fireplace accompanied by silence. Stillness. I wonder if this is something that is becoming an antique. I mean, I’ve seen 13-year-old kids with cell phones. Was the emptiness of the season an outdated thing? Nowadays I feel like we cannot escape, cannot have that anymore, that stillness. Maybe it is just a personal thing, as we grow up do we lose that peacefulness, that emptiness? I experienced it a bit a few years ago, driving around the MSU campus at dusk. It was empty and gorgeous in the pink sunset. Am I a relic? Do I expect there to be this sense that we all share that might be unfounded? I never remember seeing Christmas stuff in October. I remember waiting for the Sears catalog, but never in October. Did working in a mall do this to me? To the way I enjoy the holidays? 8 hours of music a day, lightning fast days with increasingly rude and frazzled customers.  A day off work but before you know it you&#8217;re right back into the thick of things the very next day. I wonder if this is a side effect of aging, losing those moments and memories as life piles up around your feet.</p>

I am one who believes that music is molecular, that something changes in you when you hear music. Memories are instantly associated and strengthen those connections. For me there are a few memories of Christmas music growing up. The biggest is obvious and I will discuss it in a few weeks. For now I’ll talk about the first Christmas LP I can remember, John Denver &amp; the Muppets.  I remember my parents having the John Fahey Christmas LP, the cover is a dead give away, and who amongst us didn’t either have a copy or know someone with a copy of Mitch Miller’s Christmas Sing-A-Long LP. </p>
<p>I spent eleven Christmas seasons in retail: six working in a proper record store, five working in a bookstore with a music department. At the record store we played the music of the season sparingly, tastefully. At the bookstore we played the music offensively, all day in many cases. I feel I have seen both sides of the holiday music coin. I prefer the first way, as a feature to enhance business and set a mood rather than a tool to sell things. Call me old fashioned. I never gave the music thought at the record store but found it oppressive at the bookstore, which led me to owning Holiday CDs but never choosing to listen to these records. Five Christmases out of retail have sort of cured those ill feelings.</p>
<p>I spent four Christmases as a DJ on a local radio station. There was a rule at WNMC: No Christmas music until the week of Christmas. Novel, when you think about it. Even with the availability of the music in the station the DJs, all volunteers, chose their holiday selections judiciously, respectfully. It was there, in the basement of West Hall, that I sort of re-learned to love Christmas music. I was able to find interesting recordings, play them in a way that fit the overall theme and feel of my show. Last year, far removed from both retail and radio, I actually played Christmas music recreationally. I would load up the CD player and let it play.</p>
<p>I have kids of my own now, two of them in fact. I want them to enjoy the season as a whole, and I want them to have memories of the sights, sounds and smells of the season. We have established a few traditions revolving around the holidays. An educational toy store in Suttons Bay hosts real reindeer and taking the kids to see the animals is one of the highlights of the season for me. Last year when I put on the Christmas music it was a nice, calm Sunday. I don’t remember if there was snow on the ground or in the sky. I do remember how nice it felt, sitting there and listening. I hope to give those feelings to my kids so that when they are in my shoes, maybe they will feel the same way.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I’ll be taking a look at different Christmas music. I do not expect this to be a complete look, we only have a few weeks.  Frankly we will be looking at a few of my own personal favorites. Some you may know, some you may not. I might even have a surprise to throw into a column or two. But please feel free over these next few weeks to talk about some of your personal favorite memories of Christmas music or any other Holiday music that you were raised on.</p>
