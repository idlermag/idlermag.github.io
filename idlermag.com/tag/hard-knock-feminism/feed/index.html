										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the release of <em>Bridesmaids</em> and Tina Fey’s book <em>Bossypants</em> there’s been lots of talk about funny women lately.  Here are some of my responses and gripes.  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Women are funny.</strong><br />
Period.  Moving on.</li>
<li><strong>Can we stop bemoaning the Chick Flick?</strong><br />
Much of the time our media suggests that what’s normal is a white male perspective.  Matt Damon and George Clooney and Seth Rogan and Tom Hanks will tell us the stories of our life and men and women are expected to shell out the cash and be the grateful audience. But when a movie is all about Sandra Bullock, watch out!  Chick flick alert! Suddenly the viewership is cut in half (at best) and industry and audience women alike get screwed.   </p>
<p>I know that this isn’t groundbreaking news.  I just urge everyone to consider what’s so inherently terrible about woman-centric genres.  What if you looked at what they have to offer instead of immediately eliminating them as options for what they do poorly?  What if you think about what you actually dislike about the qualities associated to the genres you avoid?  (Tip: You can do this with “man movies” too.)  I’m not claiming to know everything&mdash;I have to push myself to step back and think a lot.   I just think we could have more fruitful conversations if we stop thinking in Love/Hate, Mine/Yours dichotomies.  </p>
<p>Truth: My husband loves <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>.  I know many a man who can quote <em>Gilmore Girls</em> with the best of us.  *I* was the one who initially refused to watch either of these shows because they looked too silly and girly and dumb.  Boy, was I wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Tina Fey is not a unique snowflake.</strong><br />
She’s one of many hilarious, multi talented, strong awesome women in the world.  Have you listened to your aunts and grandmas lately?  That stuff is gold!  I’m getting really tired of every magazine and every talk show holding up Tina as the great white hope.  Yes, she’s amazing, but come on, spread the love, people.  There are other women of many shapes, sizes, colors, class and orientation.  They are just as hilarious if not funnier and they are getting no press.  Oftentimes, those who fawn over Tina discuss the hardships of women in comedy.  Well, guess what?  Comparatively, Ms. Fey doesn’t have it so rough any more.  What if the media focused on showcasing or giving a break to other women in comedy?  What if you tried to become a solution to the problem instead of reminding us how bad it sucks out there for the ladies?  I realize this is probably too much to ask.  Still, I ask it.</li>
<li><strong><em>Bridesmaids</em> is funny.</strong><br />
It is not <em>The Hangover</em> with women.  It is its own thing, okay?  I’d say it’s a pretty spot-on representation of female friendship and insecurities.  The women are flawed, but smart and talented.  They aren’t brainwashed by the bridal industry, or the patriarchy or feminism for that matter.  They engage with each of these ideologies, but they do so like fallible but self-aware human beings.  I’ve seen many a thread about this film not being feminist enough&mdash;that it doesn’t deserve the buzz or the praise it’s receiving.  If the women in the movie didn’t make mistakes, didn’t fall for the wrong men, didn’t have problems, who would be able to relate to them?  The genre of the film is light, summer fun.  <em>Bridesmaids</em> does a great job of being itself without getting too preachy or too stuffy.  If you don’t like vomit, burp and fart humor, well, then god bless you, you are a better person than me and this film is not for you. </li>
<li><strong>Go ahead and hate, haters.</strong><br />
People in Hollywood are in the business of selling themselves.  It makes sense to think that actors and famous/public figures shape their personae according to the market&mdash;women are not exempt from this.  While you’re hating Jessica Simpson for being dopey, Kathy Griffin for being annoying, Wanda Sykes along with a reeeally long list of women for being bitchy, I’m thinking, wow, that woman knows how to do her job effectively.  These women are laughing their way to the bank while you’re laughing at them in your knock-off Louboutins.</li>
<li><strong>Whatever you think or have thought about her before, read Roseanne’s <em>New York Magazine</em> piece concerning her TV fame.</strong><br />
&#8220;And I Should Know&#8221; by Roseanne Barr paints a pretty hideous picture of what it feels like to be a woman in the entertainment industry.  There are many times in Barr’s story where I think, “wow, I would have backed down.  I couldn’t have taken that.”  Women are funny, period.  Sexism is still alive and disgustingly well, exclamation point.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong><br />
A few days ago, Tim Carmody sent James Fallows&#8217; wonderful <a target="new" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1996/08/throwing-like-a-girl/6152/">&#8220;Throwing Like a Girl&#8221;</a> my way. In typically superb Fallows form, he unpacks and challenges what it means to &#8220;throw like a girl,&#8221; and why, if it&#8217;s not exactly gender specific (because plenty of women throw correctly) it&#8217;s still largely female examples we see when we think of &#8220;throwing like a girl.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For young boys it is culturally acceptable and politically correct to develop these skills,&#8221; says Linda Wells, of the Arizona State softball team. &#8220;They are mentored and networked. Usually girls are not coached at all, or are coached by Mom&mdash;or if it&#8217;s by Dad, he may not be much of an athlete. Girls are often stuck with the bottom of the male talent pool as examples. I would argue that rather than learning to &#8216;throw like a girl,&#8217; they learn to throw like poor male athletes. I say that a bad throw is &#8216;throwing like an old man.&#8217; This is not gender, it&#8217;s acculturation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong><br />
Confession: I play softball in a skirt. A running skirt, to be precise, and it&#8217;s positively the most comfortable, least restrictive article of clothing I own. (I have a nice pair of softball pants&mdash;black, always worn pulled up to the knee&mdash;but they make me feel somehow like the Tin Man; I can&#8217;t bend correctly at the waist. I only wear them when it&#8217;s too cold for anything else.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I&#8217;m becoming accustomed to the strange looks I draw when I drop my bat and bag and start stretching as my coach is finishing up with the young man who takes lessons before me. I suppose I&#8217;d just attributed it to the skirt.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong><br />
<a target="new" href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/11/16/its-looking-like-a-limb-torn-off/">We&#8217;ve already talked about my throw.</a> It&#8217;s never been girly. Now, it&#8217;s even less so.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong><br />
This week, the young man&#8217;s father, a chatty BS-er who&#8217;s always ribbing his son and the coach, said something to the effect of, &#8220;You teach softball too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, before we continue, I have to say, I couldn&#8217;t tell if the question was one of derision. I could not tell if he meant it as a slight to my coach, as though somehow he was making easy money by working with me. As though he were less manly for teaching a girl&#8217;s sport, something I saw all the time when the men coaching women&#8217;s sports in high school were dismissed as shitty coaches because a real coach would coach men.</p>
<p>All I know is that it made me a bit mad.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong><br />
Because a woman playing a sport seriously, even if somewhat ridiculously (i.e. a 30-year-old woman spending her Friday nights taking grounders and tearing her palms open in the cages), doesn&#8217;t seem to me to be preposterous. </p>
<p>As in, boys can take baseball lessons. So why is it weird for me to do the same?</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong><br />
My coach, who I will forever high-five for this, said, &#8220;Nope,&#8221; then explained that he was giving me baseball lessons with bigger balls. He added that I&#8217;m his only female client, and he took me on because I asked. </p>
<p>I realize I was standing there in a skirt, but it doesn&#8217;t sit well with me to have someone speak about me in front of me. It reminds me of being a child and having the doctor explain what&#8217;s wrong with you to your mother, even though you&#8217;re sitting right there. </p>
<p>So I told the father that this was just my mid-life crisis, but quite a bit early. Then I stepped into the cages and started taking my swings.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong><br />
Reading the Fallows piece, I started remembering things I&#8217;d seen, but been too exhausted&mdash;or too hellbent on making a perfect throw&mdash;to fully process.</p>
<p>Last week it was a crowd of older men who had just dropped their kids off at the bounce-house place next door, making sort of cat-call, sort of awe-struck noises as I was hitting. Think more &#8220;Hey-O!&#8221; and less &#8220;Oh, wow.&#8221; </p>
<p>But thinking back, it seemed like they were half shocked that I was hitting so well (they shouldn&#8217;t have been; my coach is amazing) and half like they were offering some smarmy play-by-play to each other, the kind you half-hear walking by a crowd of drunk 40-year-olds.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong><br />
Look, I get that it&#8217;s a bit of a spectacle. The parents have never seen a girl taking lessons. The bored adults waiting for the kids to finish bouncing their brains silly in the bounce house emporium wander over to the field and are not expecting to see a girl in a skirt taking grounders or crushing the ball. I get it.</p>
<p>But do they do the same thing, act the same way, when it&#8217;s a boy? What would they do if it were their daughter?</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong><br />
The other possibility: I read the Fallows piece, and became overly sensitive (&#8220;girly&#8221;) about something that wasn&#8217;t even about me. Like a hyper-reactive feminist with a very self-centered world view.</p>
<p><strong>10. </strong><br />
It&#8217;s a lifetime of the same pattern, though. Time after time, making a cogent argument about an athlete or some sporting issue in the presence of men is not taken as another fan entering the debate, but as some type of exhibition that must be possessed. As though I&#8217;m doing it to get men&#8217;s attention. (I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m married.) As though that were the trick. As though a woman cannot love baseball, unless she loves it to get a man. </p>
<p><strong>11.</strong><br />
My freshman year of high school, we were bussed out to Durand with the boys&#8217; freshman team. The boys, it turned out, didn&#8217;t have an opponent. Midway through the first game, the umpire suggested to our, Mr. Young, that we play to five innings and skip the second game to accommodate the boys. Mr. Young went nuclear.</p>
<p>He came back to the dugout and told us, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever let someone treat you differently just because you&#8217;re a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong><br />
In co-ed, rec league softball, girls are pitched a smaller ball. My coach, from day one, has been pitching me the boy balls. But we just call them what they are: the big balls. Because girls can have them too.</p>
