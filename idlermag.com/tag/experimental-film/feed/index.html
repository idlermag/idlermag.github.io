										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leviathan</em> (2012) straddles the line between documentary and avant-garde; composed entirely from footage shot on a large fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean, it hints at how life is lived on the boat, but exists primarily as a visual and auditory experience. Things happen, but there is no plot; our understanding is entirely derived from the images, sound, and what understanding (little, in my case) we might have of industrial fishing.</p>

<p>The film begins, incongruously, with a Bible verse, written in a Gothic-tribal font, then cuts to a black screen with the sound of the ocean churning. A light flickers in the bottom corner of the image, and eventually, we find ourselves on board a massive fishing boat, all clinking chains, painted metal, and winches. During the first ten minutes, we witness, through a camera strapped to one of the workers, the process of bringing up a net that’s been trawling the ocean, and then releasing the mass of slippery silver and pink fish caught in the trap. This labor feels, well, laborious, and has only just begun &#8212; when the sequence ends, we notice that light just barely turned the sky from black to navy blue.</p>
<p>The excitement and movement of the opening sequence belies the repetition and drudgery of the work to come. In two later sequences, the camera lingers on the men cleaning the fish, gutting and beheading them with an efficiency that comes from experience. To those unaccustomed to slaughter, the scene is almost enough to turn one to vegetarianism. As the men work, the camera pans down the side of the wooden bin where the newly caught fish are kept, awaiting their fate, to find it caked and dripping with gore. A group of skates are equally doomed; as a fisherman unceremoniously lifts one with meat hooks, another hacks off its wing-like fins and tosses them into a bin. The waste of the fish – heads, guts, and fins – is dumped back into the sea. With the camera sitting on the ship’s steel floor, a fish’s head sits upside down; its bulbous eye stares back at us, as if prompting a response. Then, we cut to another camera half-submerged in the sea, sometimes underwater, other times emerging into the air, as fish viscera slides out the side of the ship in a red sludge. If ever one needed a visual illustration of the term “biomass,” <em>Leviathan</em> offers it.</p>

<p>Matching the unsentimental vision of the labor needed to help feed a population eager for seafood, who in turn are shielded from the violence involved in securing those meals, is a vision of the sea as vast and all-encompassing. Shots where the camera is plunged into the water offer little but darkness and the muffled reverberations of the ship, interrupted only by the white streaks of the wake and the occasional offal. The film’s soundtrack of crashing waves, winches and chains, and the deep rumble of the engines takes on an ominous musical quality in these scenes; so much so that I imagined incidental music emerging just under hearing.</p>
<p>Whereas the scenes of labor lull you with a sense of repetition, the “underwater” sequences transform the sea into an aesthetic, where you glimpse only the occasional recognizable object &#8212; a chain, a fish, seagulls when the lens breaks the surface. <em>Leviathan</em> is one part <em>Jeanne Dielman</em> (1975), and one part <em>Dog Star Man</em> (1961-1964), though even together those films are not quite the right comparison. There is something more real, and more accidental, about <em>Leviathan</em>, something to do with the primal in the midst of the industrial. One of the last shots of the film shows one of the fisherman seated in the ship’s kitchen; the garbage from his finished meal litters the table and he looks towards us but slightly off-screen. It sounds like he’s watching <em>Deadliest Catch</em>, and what we can hear &#8212; dramatic music, narration, editing &#8212; differs so greatly from the experience we’ve just had. As the show continues, the fisherman slowly closes his eyes, obviously exhausted from his work, and the television cuts to a commercial for a colon cleanser &#8212; two final reminders of biological reality in this strange approximation of home, deep in the bowels of the floating factory. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Roger Ebert was the first film critic I read seriously. For years as a teenager I awaited his reviews every Friday, and his was the first collection of film criticism I ever bought. He taught me that one could disagree with accepted wisdom about a film, and reach one’s own conclusion about it; moreover, he taught me how to defend that opinion. I remember disliking David Lynch’s <em>Blue Velvet</em> (1986) because of Ebert’s review, and after seeing it years later and revising my opinion, his influence remained, because now the lesson had stuck &#8212; my conclusion was my own. Although I read him less in recent years, he appeared still as a model of someone who believed in both cinema and humanity. Although it is sometimes difficult to retain a trust in either, this is another of Ebert’s lessons worth remembering.   </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a teenage movie-watcher, I was the first to jump on the new-genre bandwagon whenever anyone tried something different that played with, bent or overlapped conventional film structure. Somewhere between those teenage years of wonder when everything was fascinating, and, like, 2008, I got burned by experimental filmmaking. Not enough to make me ever avoid the indie films I always had and always will gravitate toward, but enough to make me go into them slightly wary and, perhaps, not expecting to be bowled-over like I expected to be when I was fifteen, and admittedly more bowl-over-able.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="3225" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/26/howling-for-authentic-biographical-cinema-why-the-new-ginsberg-film-succeeds/howl-movie-poster/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/howl-movie-poster.jpg" data-orig-size="500,375" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Howl-movie-poster" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/howl-movie-poster.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/howl-movie-poster.jpg?w=500" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/howl-movie-poster.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Howl" title="Howl-movie-poster" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3225" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/howl-movie-poster.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/howl-movie-poster.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/howl-movie-poster.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> This year, I was bowled over like a fifteen year-old again by directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman’s amazing new film about Ginsberg, his infamous poem <em>Howl</em> and the subsequent obscenity trial. <em>Howl</em> (2010) is an effort the directors called a ‘hybrid film’: fully dramatized (stunningly and perfectly by a quietly buoyant James Franco), but with documentary-like sequences and gorgeous animated interludes. The directing duo’s previous works included <em>The Celluloid Closet</em> (1996) and Epstein’s <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em> (1984), documentaries which I already loved, but these were traditional docs, without actors in the roles. And even if they weren’t (like Gus Van Sant’s <em>Milk</em> (2008), which I also adored), dramatizing the lives of creative people&mdash;writers, artists, musicians&mdash;creates different challenges than dramatizing the lives of historical or other figures. The nature of the entertainment careers of creative people provide archiving that is more thoroughly ingested by the public, and that asserts itself as a strong, recognizable precedent in the artist’s look, voice, demeanor and <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. Ours is an entertainment-driven culture more than a historically-driven one, partly because of the deep personal fulfillment people glean from the arts. This strong attachment sometimes results in beloved creators being viewed as sort of enigmatic beings, a highly non-specific and interpretive construct for an actor to try to replicate. Playing an artist is in no way harder than playing any other type of historical figure, but I believe that actors in non-artist biographical roles are more easily accepted by the audience overall, whereas when actors play artists, there are more opportunities to misstep in the eye of the film consumer and their preconceived idea of how their favorite musician or writer should be represented on screen. So while I went into Van Sant’s <em>Milk</em> already knowing I would love it, I was excited to see <em>Howl</em>, but didn’t know what to expect.</p>

And in trying to figure out why this &#8220;hybrid&#8221; film approach succeeded in the case of <em>Howl</em> when it had fallen short in some other instances of unconventional film genre, I’ve come away with this: the main reason <em>Howl</em> was so good, apart from the obvious fantastic direction, acting (by Franco as well as the supporting cast) and production, is because every aspect of the film&mdash;from the biggest to the most subtle&mdash;was done exclusively to serve Ginsberg, the time period and the trial in the most authentic way possible.</p>
<p>It’s a little unfair to compare this aspect of Epstein’s and Friedman’s directing to a traditional director, because obviously filmmakers with a background in documentary film are better-equipped to handle the recreation of history. And in general, American films are notoriously bad at representing time periods (“A film in the 20s? Okay, we need. . . red lipstick, and. . . a bob haircut. And one of those huge radios that looks like a sideboard. Voila! We’re done!”) But the thing I loved most about <em>Howl</em> is that the focus was entirely on Ginsberg himself and the events. Even style of the animated sequences were designed by the marvelous <a target="new" href="http://www.drooker.com/">Eric Drooker</a>, an artist who collaborated directly with Ginsberg late in the poet’s life.</p>

Oftentimes this type of creative license is applauded for injecting a new twist into an already-known artist. That is certainly valid, and absolutely any director brings their own interpretation to a subject in a piece.</p>
<p>However, the problem with getting too interpretive with biopics is the potential for the personal ownership the director feels for the subject to circumvent their desire to serve the creative person themself. Too much personal interpretation by a director in a biographical film can do a disservice to the audience by encapsulating the subject in the director’s own experience. This is meaningful to the director, but it creates a static vacuum where the audience is tunneled into the director’s own feelings toward the subject and potentially out of their own. It can come off as self-indulgent to assume that your personal interpretation of a well-known creative figure is more relevant than what you would allow the audience to take away from the film if you do it to only serve the person whom the film is about, like the directors did with <em>Howl</em>.</p>
<p>I know sometimes, the director doesn’t have a choice. For instance, in the production of <em>I’m Not There</em> (2007), Todd Haynes was in a double-bind because there was no way Bob Dylan would ever, ever allow anyone to do a straight biopic of his life. The reason <em>I’m Not There</em> was made at all was because it was a highly abstracted film-idea based interpretively around Dylan’s life, songwriting and ideas of himself. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoyed <em>I’m Not There</em> (and who didn’t love seeing Cate Blanchett’s Dylan?), but I’m curious whether the narrative would be easy to follow if you weren’t already a hardcore Dylan fan with a lot of previous knowledge of the musician or hadn&#8217;t already watched Martin Scorsese’s 4-hour Bob Dylan documentary epic, <em>No Direction Home</em> (2005).</p>

This is a given. But when events are sensationalized or the tone of the people or history is changed in an effort to modernize it for contemporary audiences, or &#8220;sell&#8221; it to the audience in some way, the result is less genuine. This is something that is no doubt done out of box-office fear, trying to make a movie that will appeal to a perceived wider audience, or to ensure the draw of a more mainstream clientele outside of people who are already fans of the individual. This has huge potential to disappoint fans who really are interested in the film subject, or, in the case of the Edie Sedgwick biopoic <em>Factory Girl</em> (2006), potentially piss off people who knew the subject or were represented in the film; <a target="new" href="http://stereogum.com/4161/factory_girl_defaming_dylan/news/">i.e., Bob Dylan and Lou Reed</a> (for the record though, I’m still a fan of <em>Factory Girl</em> for other reasons).</p>
<p>History is history, and interpretive social context changes over time. For this reason, biographical films like <em>Milk</em> and <em>Howl</em> that try to present factual portraits of their subjects have the potential to remain the most powerful, watchable and memorable over time; because you remember the subject themself, not how they may have been reconfigured by, or impacted the creative life of, the director. </p>
