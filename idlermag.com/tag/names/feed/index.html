										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike many other RPGs (&#8220;Role-Playing Games&#8221; for you Normals), <a title="More information on EarthBound" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/EarthBound">EarthBound</a> (for Super Nintendo) has you name all of the characters at the start of the game, even though you won&#8217;t see all of them until later. I indulged a bit and set Ness&#8217;s name as Dan, but kept the rest of the names their defaults: Paula, Jeff, and Poo. But the naming fun does not stop there.</p>
<p>Yes, you also get to name your trusty dog, which I named Banjo, and your favorite food. Here is where a bit of sophomoric humor can take place: whatever you list as your favorite food, Mom will use in the phrase <em>&#8220;Eat some ___ and go to bed!”</em></p>
<p>As a teenage boy I saw the comedic opportunity here. I shall let you use your imagination. This time, however, I church’d it up a bit and selected the second &#8220;Don&#8217;t Care&#8221; option of &#8220;Pie.&#8221; <em>&lt;homer simpson voice&gt;</em>Mmmm, pie.<em>&lt;/homer simpson voice&gt;</em></p>
<p>You can also name &#8220;Your Favorite Thing,&#8221; which becomes the name of Ness&#8217;s powerful PSI attack. Again, this is the opportunity for a bit of low-brow humor. But, I instead came up with METAL followed by a musical note. Too bad “Canvassing for an Election” or “Reading War and Peace” wouldn’t fit.</p>
<p>Like <a title="my playthough for FFVII" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/01/06/geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-2/">Final Fantasy VII</a>, you are dropped right into the action at the start of the game (sans eco-terrorism however). Ness discovers his destiny via <a title="More information on Buzz Buzz." href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Buzz_Buzz">Buzz Buzz</a>, a talking insect from ten years in the future, who is an Obi-Wan Kenobi of sorts (for about five minutes). Ness has to stop <a title="More information on Giygas" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Giygas">Giygas</a>, who has assumed control in the future.</p>
<p>Time travel? Huzzah! That never makes for a confusing plot.</p>
<p>Early on the battles are rough, as Ness is flying solo. I had to do a bit of level grinding from the get-go just to survive the random battles. Unlike the <em>Final Fantasy</em> games, where you can more-or-less save anywhere on the world map, you must use a phone to save a game in <em>EarthBound</em>. That is correct. You have to call Dad. But wait: black phones are free, but green phones are $1/call. Pay to save? Yikes. And phones are only in certain locations. (Hotels, etc.) Double Yikes.</p>
<p>Another quirk is the item system. Instead of <em>Final Fantasy</em> where you would have &#8220;Potion x 50&#8221; in your inventory, each item in <em>EarthBound</em> takes up a slot. That&#8217;s right. If you wanted fifty hamburgers, you would need fifty slots. And, each character only has fourteen item slots &#8212; which include slots for your weapon and armor. In Ness&#8217; case, you also have to carry the ATM, Sound Stone, and Town Map pretty much all the time.</p>
<p>Oy. Item management shall be a challenge.</p>
<p>You know what else is a challenge? Gangs of enemies. While exploring the Giant Step cave, I got my butt handed to me by a squad of Black Antoids. They kept calling for help, and I was overrun. But, once I learned my first PSI attack, I showed them what’s what. <em>EarthBound</em> is very challenging in the early levels, but I once I get a teammate or two, it will get easier. Right?</p>
