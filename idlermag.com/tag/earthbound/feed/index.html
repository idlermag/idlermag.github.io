										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It took longer than I expected (I blame Thanksgiving, and <a title="Stuff to watch!" href="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/30/im-thankful-for/"><em>Mysterious Cities of Gold</em></a> being on Netflix Watch Instant), but I finished playing through <em>EarthBound</em> over the weekend. This was only my second time completing the entire game, and the first time since I was in my early-mid-lower-teens.</p>
<p>Now, the big question: <em><del>When will ALF get a new show?</del> What did I think of EarthBound this time around?</em></p>
<p>First, let’s compare to my <a title="Geek Speak – Final Fantasy VII Revisited part 1" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2010/12/23/geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-1/"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em> play through</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed a lot more subtext and thematic elements while playing <em>FFVII</em> as an adult, which is why I think the game still holds up very well. The plot, while a tad complicated, is filled with themes which still ring strong in 2011: <a title="Yep." href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/01/20/geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-4/&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=lm3dTojUIcLpgQelnJWFBg&amp;ved=0CAUQFjAA&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGUb9kOYiP4rbJd5_oL8sKBXVumg">availability of natural resources</a>, <a title="Terror!" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-2/">terrorism</a>, powerful corporations running the world, and yes, even <a title="Oh, boy. " href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-3/">cross-dressing</a>.</p>
<p>But what of <em>EarthBound</em>? Did I notice more subtext and themes? Not really, save for the final battle (I will elaborate below). Something I <strong>did</strong> notice this time around, were aspects of the game which drove me bonkers:</p>
<p><strong>No multiple save slots.</strong> Yes, you can have different “games,” but you cannot save the same game in a different slot, allowing you to backtrack if you screw up.</p>
<p><strong>The static battle screen.</strong> While I am usually a fan of simplicity, the battle screens in EarthBound were as visually engaging as a postage stamp (although I did enjoy the character design and names). Battles became a chore, and by extension, so did the game.</p>
<p><strong>The item system.</strong> <em>Sweet Batman-on-a-crutch</em>, this was perhaps the <a title="Hated it." href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-7-problems/">most infuriating aspect of the game</a>. I spent too much time juggling items between characters and Escargo Express, the “storage locker” business.</p>
<p><strong>The very linear, hand-holding, deus ex machina-filled plot</strong>. The game goes out of its way to tell you <a title="You should go in that room. Really, go ahead. I will wait here. That room looks important." href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/.../geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-8go-there-do-that /">where you go and what you should do</a>.</p>
<p>I could nitpick <em>EarthBound</em> apart for another thousand words, but I still enjoy the game. I enjoy <em>EarthBound</em> because it is so different &#8212; it is not the typical role-playing game of that era (the early-mid-1990s).</p>
<p>Now, on to the final battle. <strong>Here be Spoilers.</strong></p>
<h3>Spoilers Start Here</h3>
<p>In order for the gang to battle Giygas, they must travel back in time &#8212; but, the time machine cannot send back living tissue (the opposite of <em>The Terminator</em>). What’s a hero to do?</p>
<p>Dr. Andonuts transfers the “minds” of the heroes to robots, which are sent back in time. This is done by way of a scene of each character laying down with their eyes closed, while sounds of chainsaws, drills and hammers play in the background. Creepy.</p>
<p>Speaking of creepy, <a title="read at own risk" href="http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Games/Mother2/The-Giygas-Fetus-theory">theories abound</a> that the final battle against Giygas is some sort of thinly veiled abortion: You go back in time, before Giygas is a threat (fetus), enter a cave (vagina), travel up a fleshy path to the Devil’s Machine (uterus/cervix) and kill him &#8212; with metal, robots. <em>Ahem</em>. You can watch for yourself, <a title="Oh, boy." href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gbG_gzgyJI">here</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, you do go back in time and kill Giygas when he is weaker &#8212; not unlike the plot to kill John Connor’s mother before he is born in <em>Terminator</em> (called “retroactive abortion” in the film). I found <a title="Eep." href="http://forum.valinor.com.br/attachment.php?attachmentid=17753&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1210564833">an image online</a> which points out a fetus-like image later in the battle, and connects the dots of the theory. Part of this theory also suggests Giygas is only attacking Ness and the others in defense, and he was not evil during the fight (he was just a fetus, or at least not evil &#8216;yet&#8217;).</p>
<p><strong>Do I buy into this theory?</strong> Not really. I am a firm believer in &#8220;if you go looking for something, you can find it.&#8221; I once wrote a (terrible) film theory paper on how <em>The Breakfast Club</em> represented the American Revolution, and another (even worse) on how <em>Gremlins</em> can be seen as an allegory for Western Capitalism run amok (I can lay on the BS when needed, as you have learned by now) .</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>While <em>EarthBound</em> can be frustrating, it is none the less a very original, genre breaking RPG. Yes, playing became more of a chore toward the end, but I am glad I finished. Despite the game&#8217;s annoyances, I am happy I took the time to replay this quirky Super Nintendo classic &#8212; because, <a title="Geek Speak – Earthbound Revisited, Part One: All My Friends are in There" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/09/13/geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-pt-1/">all of my friends are in there</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will say this about <em>EarthBound</em>, it has no shortage of curveballs and it does take you to some strange locations. In a different role-playing game (RPG), some of the locations may not stand out so much, but given the &#8220;suburban&#8221; look and feel of most of the game, the more &#8220;unique&#8221; locales can be filed under <em>What the French Toast</em>?</p>
<p>After leaving the desert, via a yellow submarine (yes), the party comes to a swamp area known as The Deep Darkness.</p>
<p>Now, if the party was one of leather-clad warriors wielding insanely huge swords, then Deep Darkness would not stand out. But, the party in <em>EarthBound</em> is one of suburban kids with baseball bats and frying pans. In this case, trudging through a swamp, beating up baddies with said bats and pans draws attention to the fact this is quirky game and nearly knocks the player out of the game.</p>
<p>You’re thinking <del>“Why am I reading this?&#8221;</del> &#8220;What?”</p>
<p>Let me explain. Or at least try.</p>
<p>The other RPGs released for Super Nintendo around the time of <em>EarthBound</em> had more of a fantasy look (<em>Final Fantasy II</em> and <em>III</em>, <em>Secret of Mana</em>, <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, etc). In such a setting, a dark swamp filled with strange creatures fits &#8212; we expect such a thing, like a spooky dungeon or a strange forest. Such settings are &#8220;stock characters&#8221; for RPGs because of the &#8220;fantasy&#8221; setting in which they (usually) take place.</p>
<p>But, when you throw a stock setting like Deep Darkness into a game like <em>EarthBound</em>, it sticks out. Why? Because the characters are different than those in other RPGs of the time.</p>
<p>For example, Crono and the gang fighting their way through a vine-filled, snake-infested swamp fits in <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, because they complement each other. Whereas in <em>EarthBound</em>, the characters are such a contrast to the setting, it nearly knocks the player out of the game. Crono, a talking frog, and a lonely robot traveling through a poor man’s <a title="Yoda's hood." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagobah">Dagobah</a>? Sure. Gamers buy it. Three suburban teens armed with household items beating up crocodiles? Uhh.</p>
<p>This is why <em>EarthBound</em> is a “love it or hate it” game &#8212; it breaks molds and plays with what the player expects from a 1990s RPG.</p>
<p>Is this a bad thing? No. <em>EarthBound</em> is unique, which is why it has legions of fans. If we look at the game as a satire of other RPGs of the time, then all of this makes sense.</p>
<p>I think.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am currently in the Egypt-themed country of Scaraba, and the story gets pretty interesting. By which I mean, strange. No surprise there, right?</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Scaraba, I came upon an NPC on the edge of town and he informed me, “The fat kid did his business over there.” Sure enough, on the sand there are a pair of black pixels. Upon inspecting the pixels, the game says (more or less) “Pokey’s stink still hangs in the air.”</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>A defecation joke in a Super Nintendo Game? <em>Dang</em>.</p>
<p>And this was not even the strangest part of Scaraba. Really. <a title="Details" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeon_Man#Dungeon_Man">Dungeon Man</a> is perhaps the strangest (but in a cool way). Dungeon Man is, according to the game, “the first fusion of Man and Dungeon.”</p>
<p>Yes, Dungeon Man is <em>a giant walking dungeon</em>. He also joins the party (Poo left for a bit to learn Starstorm). This is sort of like if <a title="wiki" href="http://www.tfu.info/1986/Autobot/Metroplex/metroplex.htm">Metroplex</a> from <em>The Transformers</em> joined the party. I should add, Dungeon Man started out as a very human dungeon designer by the name of Brick Road. Jeff’s father, Dr. Andonuts, made the fusion of Man and Dungeon possible. Again, this foreshadows later events in the game.</p>
<p>Oh, and Dungeon Man also has folks living inside, including a Hospital (where you can heal your party). This reminds me of the <em>Futurama</em> episode where Fry becomes infested with <a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasites_Lost">intelligent space worms</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I added the remaining player character to my party this week: <a title="Wiki" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Poo">Poo</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, that is his name. I read an article where the writer wondered why his Japanese name was not translated as Pu, but given the quirkiness of the game, along with the inclusion of characters like Master Barf, Poo fits.</p>
<p>Poo, like Ness and Paula, can use PSI powers. He is also rather strong, which makes him a great secondary fighter (after Ness).</p>
<p>Since Poo started at out at level 15, and the rest of my party was pushing 50, I had to do a bit of level grinding. That’s always fun. Nothing I enjoy more than an hour spent beating up enemies to boost stats. /snark</p>
<p>Level grinding is something I never really thought about, or spent time on, when I originally played <em>EarthBound</em> as a teen. My original save file is still on the cartridge (and I&#8217;m playing on my original Super Nintendo), and I beat the game with Ness at level 59. Currently, I have Ness at level 53 and there is plenty of game left.</p>
<p>But, back to Poo. The prince is not without his own quirks (yes, he is a prince, but sadly not the musician. Image <em>that</em> game).  Mainly, only certain foods will give Poo more than six or so HP. The player’s guide presents this as some sort of commentary on the Standard American Diet (lots of meat, junk food), as Poo is from a country where everyone lives on water and rice gruel.</p>
<p>To sum up, feeding Poo a burger is a waste of money. He will only recover a few HP. So yes, we have a video game character with a particular diet. In some ways, this is a rather ingenious feature. But, in many ways, it is rather annoying. The easiest trick is to just load up on items which restore PP (the game’s version of magic points) and use Lifeup instead of items.</p>
<p>However, I need to back up and mention how the game introduces Poo. Ness and the party consume a Magic Cake in Summers, which induces a psychedelic freak-out-state. The game shifts control to Poo, who is far away in another country. And this is not the first time the game has the characters consume mind-altering foodstuffs either.</p>
<p>Remember the coffee with <a title="Geek Speak – EarthBound Revisited, pt. 5: They Call Me Mr. Saturn" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/10/18/geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-pt-5-they-call-me-mr-saturn/">Mr. Saturn</a>?</p>
<p>Being familiar with the later parts of the game, I now think these two experiences (the coffee, the Magic Cake) foreshadow some of the stranger events to come.</p>

I love that you can walk around with a teddy bear to attract enemy attacks!</p>
<p>And I especially love the boss fights, which are often unexpected in a deeply refreshing way. You can run into a boss in the middle of a town instead of always having to fight through a huge dungeon, and they have <em>personality</em>. In fact, if there&#8217;s one thing that this game has, it&#8217;s personality. It takes RPG tropes and tweaks them a little. You can&#8217;t take any of the standard RPG mechanics for granted (see Daniel&#8217;s column this week about Poo&#8217;s unique diet), and everything from the battle narration to the save system is just a little offbeat in a really good way.</p>
<p>And yet. For a game with such wonderful personality, the protagonist, Ness, has none at all. There&#8217;s no feeling of an overarching direction. And, worst of all, when I turn off the game, I don&#8217;t think about it. At all. It&#8217;s not until I&#8217;m coming up on another Gamer&#8217;s Club deadline that I remember that I need to put some time in. And, until I turn on the game at least, it feels like such a chore.</p>
<p>In fact, if I think about the game at all, it&#8217;s to try to figure out what it could be possibly missing. Why does it seem to measure up so poorly to its near-contemporaries <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, <em>A Link to the Past</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy III</em> (<em>VI</em>)? Part of it, certainly, is that the graphics and animation are sub-par &#8212; In fact, it&#8217;s not much beyond what I would expect from an NES rather than an SNES title &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t seem sufficient. I played through the original <em>Final Fantasy</em> a few years ago, long, long after its original NES release, and even in its polished Game Boy Advance re-release, the game is no more technically advanced or polished than <em>EarthBound</em>, and it&#8217;s far less unique.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a genuine conundrum, and this, if nothing else, has kept me playing for the past few weeks.</p>
<p>But I think I&#8217;ve figured it out. While Ness&#8217;s lack of personality is in itself far from a deal-breaker &#8212; none of the playable characters in the original <em>Final Fantasy</em> have any personality at all &#8212; and despite the fact that <em>EarthBound</em>&#8216;s designers clearly put a lot of energy into creating the world of the game, the game itself spends no time or energy exploring Ness&#8217;s place in that world, and that&#8217;s making it difficult for me to get invested in playing.</p>
<p>Let me give an example, using the last Gamers&#8217; Club game. In <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, you don&#8217;t just have a quest, or a world to explore, you have a main character, Cloud, who has left one life, as a member of the elite military group SOLDIER, and is trying to start another. Initially, that means working as a mercenary with the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, but the game quickly throws not only Cloud&#8217;s self-conception, but his entire past, memory, and even his birth into question. You, as the player, are trying to save the world, but you&#8217;re also trying to solve a mystery, and your relationships with the supporting characters and villains are critical to that mystery.</p>
<p>In short, everything matters, and it brought me back, even when playing the game felt like homework. (Deadlines are deadlines.)</p>
<p><em>EarthBound</em> isn&#8217;t giving me that, and so, for now, I&#8217;m going to let it fall to the side. It&#8217;s been an interesting experiment, and a fertile imaginative world at an unsettled time in my life. I&#8217;m glad that I gave the game a go, and one day I will come back to it. You know, when I finish reading all those books I&#8217;ve been meaning to read, or after I make it through <em>Indigo Prophecy</em>, or the <em>Ico/Shadow of the Colossus</em> re-release. (Aw, yeah.)</p>
<p>So long, <em>EarthBound</em>. We&#8217;ll meet again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally rescued Paula (for the second time) the other night, and I am glad to have her back in the party. I missed her PSI Powers. But, maybe I missed her extra item slots even more (OK, that sounds kind of dirty).</p>
<p>Last week, I touched on some of the <a title="Geek Speak – EarthBound Revisited, Pt. 7: Problems" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/11/01/geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-7-problems/">heavy handed plot elements</a> in the game, and well, the exposition and hand-holding was piled on again.</p>
<p>I mentioned last week how the game dishes out plot driving items without little or no involvement on the player&#8217;s part (they aren&#8217;t really connected to what the party is doing at the moment).</p>
<p>Case in point, Apple Kid.</p>
<p>Apple Kid randomly calls Ness up to say he has invented X device to help the party do Y. This really sticks out, because he phrases the calls in such a way to suggest he invented the necessary gadget without having any idea of what the party is doing. Coincidence, he has it.</p>
<p>I guess this plays into Apple Kid&#8217;s &#8220;unappreciated genius&#8221; status a bit, but it would probably make for better storytelling if Ness went to Apple Kid for help in the first place and the party had to search for the items to build the gadget.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that &#8220;Apple&#8221; Kid invented a portable phone to help the party is not lost on me. Did <em>EarthBound</em> predict the iPhone? Maybe.  (See: <em>You Can Find Meaning When You Want to Find It</em>.)</p>
<p>What I really noticed this past week was how the NPCs (non-player characters) try really hard to tell Ness where he should go. For example, NPCs will say something like &#8220;Man, that room behind me looks pretty weird. You should go check it out. Go ahead, I&#8217;ll wait here.&#8221;</p>
<p>This grew to annoy me a bit, as the &#8220;go there,&#8221; &#8220;do this&#8221; text came in a flood during and after rescuing Paula.</p>
<p>Then I thought it over a bit. I figured, <em>EarthBound</em> was (more or less) intended for gamers around half my age. When I played this game originally as a teenager, I was &#8220;age appropriate&#8221; and did not notice the spoon-fed plot as much.</p>
<p>Let us (<em>lettuce?</em>) not forget the translation factor. The over-obvious plot (at least the text) could be the result of the English translator. Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>I guess the mantra of <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> is worth noting here:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a show, I should really just relax.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><em>EarthBound</em> is just a video game. An atypical video game yes, but still a video game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-make-or-break/">last week</a> I said that this was going to be a make or break week for me. Well, I don&#8217;t know that I can say that another couple of hours of play made <em>EarthBound</em> for me, but at least I can say it didn&#8217;t break it either.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a close thing, and while at the moment there&#8217;s (just) enough to keep me going, there are times when the game itself specifically neglects to encourage to to continue playing. Every time you save your game by calling your dad, he asks you if you want to turn the game off, and sounds a bit disappointed if you say that you want to continue playing.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a relic of days before save points, quicksaves, and autosaves, days when getting <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/06/housed/">housed</a> was just part of playing an RPG, days when you would lose an entire term paper when your word processing program crashed.</p>
<p>Days, in other words, best forgotten.</p>
<p>I spent most of this week in Happy Happy, which Daniel wrote about in <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/09/27/earthbound-happy-happy/">week 3</a>. (Yeah, I&#8217;m a bit behind. Did I mention that I&#8217;m living in a new state?) Happy Happy is a town run by a cult known as the Happyists, who run around in blue Klu Klux Klan robes and have painted the town, well, blue. Not coincidentally, when you run into hostile townspeople in Twoson, what color are they? Yeah, you got it.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s something sinister about the color blue in this game. We&#8217;ll store that away for future reference.</p>
<p>In Happy Happy, you find a house where a girl named Paula is being held. Pokey sics a couple of cultists on you and runs away. (<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-hokey-pokey/">He apparently shows up later, too.</a>) When you confront the cult&#8217;s leader, a man named Carpainter, he&#8217;s standing in front of a statue of Gygas &#8212; finally! It&#8217;s almost easy to forget that Gygas is supposed to be the big bad in this game, since we haven’t seen any sign of him since Lier X. Agerate showed off the statue he found under his house. (It is, in fact, the same statue in Happy Happy &#8212; Carpainter bought it from Lier.)</p>
<p>When Carpainter is defeated (which was actually pretty easy. I had Ness at level 16, which was apparently perfectly adequate), Pokey shows up and apologizes. Then he yells “psych!” and runs away. Jerk.</p>
<p>Paula, somewhat oddly, starts off at level 1, with strength and hit points (or lack thereof) accordingly, but she catches up quickly, and learns several PSI abilities. She’s still not terribly powerful, but her extra item slots are valuable in and of themselves.</p>
<p>If I had any observations at this point, it that Lilliput Steps is an oddly non-essential area. It&#8217;s where you record the second Sanctuary Song, but there&#8217;s nothing else that you need in the game to progress to the next town. It&#8217;s even geographically removed &#8212; a side area adjacent to Happy Happy &#8212; and when you rescue Paula, she encourages you to return to Twoson as opposed to going after the Sanctuary Song. In all truth, this is probably intended to give you a chance to level Paula up a bit, and for all I know, the game&#8217;s designers do intend for you to come back to Lilliput Steps (a little) later in the game. If Carpainter was an easy boss fight, the Mondo Mole was actually pretty hard. With Ness at level 20 and Paula at level 16, I only just survived.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m making progress! Also, I finished <em>Arkham City</em>, so that&#8217;s not a distraction (read: far better game) anymore. So, onward!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week, my gamer brothers-in-arms, <a title="Gavin's post last week." href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-make-or-break/">Gavin</a> and Andrew, hinted at <em>EarthBound</em> testing their patience. Andrew, bless him, even went so far to title last week&#8217;s post <a title="Andrew's post." href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/25/earthbound-i-loathe-this-game/"><em>&#8220;I loathe this game.&#8221;</em></a></p>
<p>However, while I do not plan on giving up, I told the fellas to do whatever they wish. Since this snag came up, it inspired me to weigh in on my feelings about the game overall.</p>
<p>I do not fault Gavin and Andrew for wanting to hang up their controllers. <em>EarthBound</em> can be a challenging game. It is not without its faults. Compared to other classic RPGs on the Super Nintendo, <em>EarthBound</em> is lacking in some areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I hate the item system.</strong> It is a constant source of frustration. Yes, on some level, it adds a bit of &#8220;realism&#8221; to the game: each item takes up a slot, and each character only has so many slots. I suppose I should count my blessings. It could be like the item system in <em>Resident Evil</em>, where you must arrange items like pieces in Tetris to fit inside your &#8220;backpack.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>The battles are visually boring.</strong> Granted, coming to <em>EarthBound</em> after <a title="Final Fantasy VII Revisited" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/category/blog/geek-speak/games/final-fantasy-vii-revisited/"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a> may not have been the best move. While I enjoy the design and names of the enemies (e.g., Annoying Old Party Man, Cute Li&#8217;l UFO), the static sprites and lack of player sprites make battles about as visually engaging as a postage stamp. Compare this to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> or <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, two other classic RPGs for the Super Nintendo (yes, I know the enemies were also static in <em>FFVI</em>, but at least the player characters moved).</li>
<li><strong>Character abilities are somewhat lacking.</strong> Again, I must refer back to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Each of those games featured characters with a wide array of abilities. Yes, Ness and Paula have their PSI attacks, but few, if any, are as interesting as Sabin&#8217;s attacks in <em>FFVI</em>, or X-Strike in <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Jeff is the most lacking of the three (soon to be four, once I get Poo). He cannot use PSI attacks, but he can Spy to learn an enemy&#8217;s weakness. He can also use Bottle Rockets and such, but you can only carry so many due to the item system (see above).</li>
<li><strong>The game play is very linear.</strong> I don&#8217;t always hate linear games. The world opens up a bit once you learn Teleport (which I did recently), but it is nothing like <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> or <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. A point Andrew brought up was, essentially, how the party just goes somewhere and then the game rewards them <a title="Andrew's post." href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/11/earthbound-let%E2%80%99s-roll-another-boulder-up-the-hill-shall-we/">with an item to progress further</a>. I didn&#8217;t really think about this until he pointed it out, but this does happen quite a bit. Apple Kid and others supply the party with items to move the story along, without much (or any) effort on the player&#8217;s part, in such a way that it is almost like a time release Plot Pill.</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, I make these observations as a fan of the game. I still love <em>EarthBound</em>, despite these faults, and I look forward to completing this wacky, quirky adventure. There is no such thing as a perfect video game. Well, except for maybe <a title="Kidding. Ms. Pac-Man." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgertime">BurgerTime</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where You At?:</strong>  Fourside (still!)<br />
<strong>Sanctuary Songs Recorded:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Party:</strong> Ness, Jeff</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt this game is strange and, by all rights, I should love it for its quirkiness alone. I mean, I can’t tell you how many ostensibly terrible anime series I found myself plowing through in order to simple find the goodness. Sadly, I think <em>Earthbound</em> was doomed from the start. The graphics alone betray a cookie cutter element. Mind you, there were limitations to the medium during the time of Super Nintendo, but <em>Earthbound</em> doesn’t seem to play with them. Compare to three screenshots from my favorite SNES games.</p>

<p>The games menu system is already clunky, I need to press three buttons minimum to even interact with the world and then the combat itself boils down to a series of menus. It might be forgivable if SNES wasn’t the golden age of RPGs or if it was developed for the previous system (remember how horrible <em>Final Fantasy</em> was in retrospect?), but the days of text adventures and progressive MUDs had long past.</p>
<p>Simply put, I expected more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have made it to <a title="Wiki" href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Fourside">Fourside</a>, which according to the Player’s Guide, is supposed to be some kind of New York City analogue. Interesting, considering Fourside has some of the least amount of &#8220;citizens&#8221; walking around when compared to the smaller towns.</p>
<p>But, it does have a Dinosaur Museum. Which is great. However, the main interesting point about Fourside is the reappearance of Ness’ neighbor, Pokey.</p>
<p>Last time we saw Pokey, he was second in command of the Happy Happyist cult. He even arranged, and took part in, <a title="Geek Speak – EarthBound Revisited, Pt. 3: Happy Happy" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/09/27/geek-speak-earthbound-revisited-pt-3-happy-happy/">Paula’s capture</a> for her use in a human sacrifice. These days, he is an advisor of sorts and right-hand man to the businessman who runs Fourside, Geldegarde Monotoli. Running a cult, kidnapping, and human sacrifices: yep, these tie into a career in business perfectly.</p>
<p>Pokey has quite the career going.</p>
<p>In both situations, he is the right hand man of someone in power &#8212; but is Pokey the one really running the show? Was he using Mr. Carpainter as a puppet? Perhaps. And when that failed, thanks to Ness’ intervention, did Pokey try to repeat his success with Monotoli? It would appear to be the case.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, where the &#8220;baddie&#8221; the party is after is not necessarily always the one calling all of the shots. There is usually always someone else behind the scene <a title="Final Fantasy VII Revisited, pt. 4" href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/2011/01/20/geek-speak-final-fantasy-vii-revisited-part-4/">pulling the strings</a>.</p>
<p>Pokey seems to be the middleman between the &#8220;adult&#8221; villains Ness runs into and Giygas, the villain Buzz Buzz warned Ness about at the beginning of the game. Is Pokey <em>EarthBound</em>’s answer to Wormtongue from <a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a>? Maybe. He influences others and puts himself in a position of power just like Wormtongue.</p>
<p>Pokey’s young age makes his actions a bit unsettling. He’s <em>thirteen</em>. It is obvious he has no hesitation about doing what is necessary to get power (kidnapping and human sacrifices) or cares whom he sides with (cultists, crooked business men). When I originally played <em>EarthBound</em> as a teenager, I didn’t really think about this fact. But, at the age of thirty, I pay more attention to such details than as a teenager.</p>
<p>Maybe Bill Cosby was right about kids having “<a title="Brain damage!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyMSc97UksM">the brain damage</a>.” As a kid, I just took <em>EarthBound</em> at face value: a goofy video game. As an adult, I read between the lines (to some extent) and take in what the game is saying or showing.</p>
<p>Having studied film and animation, and created my own works (novels, animated shorts, short films, etc.) I know that everything in a work is there for a reason (usually). Pokey looks the way he does, acts the way he does and says what he says because the game designer wanted it to be so.</p>
<p>However, I think if you want to find a certain meaning in a work, and go looking for it, you <em>can</em> find any meaning you want. (&#8220;The <em>Care Bears Movie</em> is about drug addiction? It makes so much sense!&#8221;)</p>
<p>So what is the game designer, or perhaps the English game translator, saying with Pokey? Don’t trust thirteen year olds? Maybe. Bill Cosby is making more sense by the minute.</p>
<p>But then I remembered <a title="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw0Rp0BKgYE"><em>Ghost Dad</em></a> and <a title="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJX-4yTlWXM"><em>Leonard Part Six</em></a> existed.</p>
