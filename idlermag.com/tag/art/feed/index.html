										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While in Denver for a summer wedding, I had the opportunity to visit the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), a smallish, spare, but amazing space in the city’s downtown. Though contemporary art is thought of by many as bizarre, lacking in subtlety, garish or shocking for the sake of being garish and shocking, the contemporary section of any art museum tends to be my favorite. Is it because I’m a postmodernist who critiques, but ultimately embraces the power of play, metaplay, and remixing? Is it because I’m the kind of mucky muck who throws around words like “postmodern?” Who’s to say? It’s not that I’m against the more classic works, no, not at all! Mostly, I’m just not very moved by the “crusty old portraiture of important white dudes and the wives who married them” displays in your typical art museum. Funny then that the work that most struck and inspired me at the MCA was a collection of what, at first glance, seems to be exactly that kind of historical portraiture.  </p>
<p>So, yes, when I paid my (actually pretty cheap) entrance fee and turned the corner to see Frohawk Two Feathers’ first room of pieces I wasn’t too sure what I had gotten myself into. Upon further inspection, I found a number of portraits and maps each painted and weathered in a style that suggests they were artifacts from a distant past. The portraits featured royals, generals, early settlers from a colonial history dreamed up and intricately fleshed out by Two Feathers’ research and imagination. Instead of your typical placards simply offering title, medium, and artist information, the signs also presented a healthy helping of facts about the figures and spaces depicted in the paintings. Moving from piece to piece, one gathers patchwork pieces of the larger story of the “Frenglish Empire” and its expansion to North American territory. Somewhat based upon historical accounts of figures like Cromwell and Napoleon Bonaparte, Two Feathers’ narrative is built from many familiar plot points. The pictures and their accompanying (his)stories ultimately play with, question, and critique the histories we know and cling to while additionally parsing issues of domination, colonialism, wealth, and representation.  </p>
<p>Frohawk Two Feathers’ commentary on authenticity and archives as it forms in this production of false-ish history is complex, revisionary, and playful. Depictions of these people &#8212; people important enough to be enunciated through art and whose renderings are then worthy of keeping as historical artifact &#8212; are refreshingly colorful, tattooed, and often outfitted in period costume with nods to modern day urban and ethnically marked looks. Men and women sport bandanas and teardrop tats on their brown (Native, Spanish, African, mixed) bodies while holding the poses of the noble people we overwhelmingly have encountered as white in our historical instruction. In creating these characters, he imagines a history in which people of color make the rules, set the fashions, mark the territory, and though it is no less war-mongering than the stories we already know, the insertion of color in this way not only creates a picture of pride and power where we rarely see one (as in a museum setting) but also critiques the level to which white history has been constructed as Truth.  </p>

<p>The artist’s maps and sculptural artifacts such as drums and animal skins painted from the perspective of native peoples further complicate and renegotiate issues of constructedness, authenticity, and point of view. Representations of important battles might be framed with images of the gape-jawed gods that protect or rule a community &#8212; sea monsters ruling the edges of a map’s open water. Little white male figures looking like tiny George Washingtons are drawn cowering in fear or stupified in the face of more powerful native warriors on steady steeds. At times I felt Two Feathers’ message could devolve into a simple flipping of power &#8212; one that luxuriates in a revenge fantasy, or too simply plays with hot-button postcolonial concerns.  However, though I can’t explain it precisely, the feel of the entire show at the MCA never dipped that low. The tiny details in the tattoo and map ink and in the remaking, the fashioning of objects, successfully elevated the work into an endlessly thought-provoking and disruptive artistic plane.  </p>
<p>Since I know we can’t all attend weddings in Colorado, I suggest you check this artist out in whatever way you can. Two Feathers’ various multi-media pieces tug at the structures we so often take for granted as real or normative or invisible.  His work reminds us that the way we map and the things we archive define peoples and cultures and thus the cartographers and archivists hold a special power.  Through his invention of the past he demonstrates that history has always been storytelling and making, and history has always been and continues to be invented.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wonder what is like being from another country. This sounds sort of stupid, but Americans often have a strange, warped view of the music of other countries. It is not unexpected to have a country-specific oritentation towards your own pop culture. We are the center of our experience and of our own perspective. In music, we are aware of the music originating in other countries, but it ebbs and flows. In the 90s the pendulum was the alt.rock movement coming from Seattle and other spots. Then the pendulum swung towards the UK with Oasis and Britpop. But what would the 90s have been like in other countries? Just how dominant is the American music scene in other countries? How did the music coming from the USA play in these countries during musical boom times and musical bust times? What happens when the pendulum swings in the opposite direction?</p>
<p>England may not the best example, since the UK has produced so much of our popular music in the past 50 years. Let’s think about other English-speaking countries like Canada and Australia. Have you ever tried to watch the Juno awards on CBC and felt that even without a language barrier that you may as well have been watching a program on how to learn Morse code? A quick trawl through the record books shows an unmatched FIVE YEAR WINNING STREAK FOR BRYAN ADAMS. On the female side, Anne Murray and Celine Dion have four-year streaks. The Tragically Hip, a quintessentially Canadian band, have won multiple Juno awards. </p>
<p>The Aria awards, from Australia, can feel equally as disjointed. The Hall of Fame class of 2011 consisted of Kylie Minogue and the Wiggles. Yes. The Wiggles, torturers of parents for over a decade. Yet a swirl through the award winners does not always yield a wacky result. For in 1998 the Aria Album of the Year was <em>Unit</em> by the Brisbane band, Regurgitator. Never heard of them? Of course not! But I have, and let me tell you, they’re great.</p>
<p>In 1998 I spent some time participating in an overseas study program through Michigan State University. I spent time in Australia, folks, Sydney and Canberra to be more precise. Now you would not know this from looking at me but I LOVE Australia and have for thirty years. (Is that possible? When did I first learn of Australia? Let’s see. . . Superman 2 on HBO, Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor wanting beachfront property, globe spins to. . . Australi. New Year&#8217;s Day 1982. Yep, thirty years) Once I got over my initial cowardice and signed up for the program, I departed from Detroit in early January of 1998.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9269" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/23/regurgitated/unit/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Unit" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=640" alt="Unit" title="Unit"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-9269" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/unit.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> Once in Australia, I heard bits and bobs about this band from Brisbane. The HMV store I lived at in Sydney had the CD on display, a silver cover with a great yellow circle on the front. Yet I didn’t buy it. When our group arrived in Canberra I remember talking with an Australian girl about the band, “the Gurge” she called them. I was really trying to chat her up when my attention was distracted by a ditz with big brown eyes (look it up) and when I turned around the Aussie was gone. But her words on the band stuck with me. I bought a Rolling Stone with the band on the cover and read up on them before really digging into their catalog. It took my return to the states before I got a chance to buy <em>Unit</em>. Actually, I came into work one day and there was in my locker. I had no idea my manager ordered it for me from the import sheets, and it was such a wonderful shock. I bought the disc and took it home to listen to it.</p>
<p>The disc opens with the song, “I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff.” You need to know the first LP, <em>Tu Plang</em>, to understand that opening song. On their first CD the band is very rockish, muscular and melodic, with lots of crash and <em>sturm und drang</em>. The humor is evident (&#8220;I Sucked A Lot of Cock To Get Where I Am&#8221;) as are the band’s interest in different sounds (&#8220;G7 Dick Electric Boogie&#8221;). Hearing those songs and then this first song, you come to an understanding that the band is branching into a new direction, one that may not be well received. But then on &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; the band is just a ripping motor of super fast, super fun music. Two songs in and <em>Unit</em> is only about 6 minutes long and just tons of fun. Then you get to the third song, called “! (The Song Formerly Known As)&#8221; which is a killer. Sort of like a hybrid Prince song, catchy and rocking and vibrant. In these songs you hear the sounds that were being planted on that first disc and watching them bloom is very exciting. The disc was strong in 1998 and while it isn’t quite as strong in 2012, the tracks that stood out still stand out. &#8220;Bubble Boy&#8221; is the second greatest song about an inflatable sex doll, only trailing Roxy Music’s &#8220;In Every Dream Home A Heartache&#8221; on that sparsely inhabited trail.</p>
<p>The not-yet-extinct music video helped the band with their image and the videos from the <em>Unit</em> LP are as strong as the songs. &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; acts out the plot to <em>Tron</em>, while “!” shows the band standing around in Japanese crowds.  Other videos are computer animated and silly and disposable but somehow entertaining and engaging as well.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9270" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/23/regurgitated/art1/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg" data-orig-size="300,300" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Art1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=300" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=640" alt=". . . Art" title="Art1"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-9270" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/art1.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> There are a few themes that pop up on <em>Unit</em> that make their way into Regurgitator’s follow-up CD, <em>. . . Art</em>, most notably a sense of disconnection from humanity and the embrace of technology as a substitute for traditional human interaction. These themes are sometimes subtle, sometimes not. Even on their poppiest of songs, and man oh man does <em>. . . Art</em> have some poppy songs, there is a bittersweet underpinning to every lyric. On &#8220;Everyday Formula&#8221; from <em>Unit</em>, Quan Yeomans sings “everyday I talk to my machines/more sense than talking with human beings.” This disconnect, the withdrawal into the virtual doesn’t sound too far-fetched today but in 1998 could it have seemed real? The last song on <em>. . . Art</em> is titled &#8220;Virtual Life&#8221; and the words are about needing everything from the TV screen and needing nothing else from a regular life. As a man who spends too much time on Facebook, this song feels prophetic. We surrender so much of ourselves to exist online.</p>
<p>When I was in Australia I noticed a sign in the classrooms on my second day in the country: a sign beckoning students to turn off their cell phones. Back home, cell phones were car phones and were the size of a foot. They weren’t everywhere and they certainly weren’t “your phone.” In some ways it feels strange that one of the most removed continents, hell, THE most removed continent on the globe would be so quick to adapt to new technology. At the same time, with that early adaption, perhaps that is where the burnout so aptly described on these songs originates. In the late 90s there was so much of an undercurrent of chatter speaking to “pre-millennium tension” but without any substance or understanding of where that tension originated from. Here, in Australia, was a band that was singing out about a different type of tension between technology and human connection, which has grown and overgrown the globe in the 14 years since the words were put to tape.</p>
<p>When I listen to <em>Unit</em> and <em>. . . Art</em>, I am magically whisked away from here to another land and another time. As with any nostalgia, some of the memories hold up, some don’t. The tracks on these two LPs, however, hold up in all their poppy greatness. I see that the band continues to record and release music. I’m glad for that as we are all better off with a band like Regurgitator in the world. Humor, discontent, observation and melody. What more do you need?</p>

<p><em>What are some of your previous and current projects? Past or present employers?</em></p>
<p>There are not enough hours in a day for an artist! Right now I&#8217;m working at an animation studio called Oddbot Inc. I&#8217;m currently working on background design on a few different shows, but mainly I work on a super-secret Disney show. I also work on shorts for <em>Mad TV</em> for Cartoon Network. Before that, I worked as a background colorist at 6 Point Harness on a show called <em>Good Vibes</em> that just starting airing on MTV on Thursday nights, after <em>Beavis and Butt-Head</em>. I do Hallmark Ecards on the side and I&#8217;ve also done character design work for a handful of animated pilots. Just recently, I did coloring for Boom! comics for a new, yet-to-be-announced title. I&#8217;m also in gallery shows around LA with a group called Girls Drawing Girls.</p>
<p><em>Where did you go to school for art?</em></p>
<p>I graduated from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em></p>
<p>Ever since I was knee high to a grasshopper, I knew I wanted to be an artist. I remember watching <em>The Muppet Show</em> and they had a &#8220;starving artist&#8221; character once… I remember thinking, &#8220;I would like to be a starving artist when I grow up.&#8221; Well, thankfully I&#8217;m not starving, but I am an artist!</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em></p>
<p>Looking at other artwork is always inspiring. Sometimes I&#8217;ll see an artist&#8217;s work that just blows me away and inspires me to work harder on my own art. I enjoy hanging out with other artists. It seems like if I hang out with other ambitious people, it motivates me to work harder. I like going to a coffee shop and drawing people I see &#8212; cute hipster couples, old people, or ladies with big hats [laughs]. I also like to listen to really epic soundtracks while I draw, or watch movies that make me feel a certain way.</p>

<p><em>What are some of your previous and current projects? Past or present employers?</em></p>
<p>I started out self-publishing minicomics in high school and throughout university, and later started working professionally in picture books. I&#8217;ve done work for comics anthologies like Oni&#8217;s <em>Yo Gabba Gabba</em> comics and <em>Nursery Rhyme Comics</em> from First Second. I&#8217;ve contributed illustrations to genre anthologies like Thackery T. Lambshead&#8217;s <em>Cabinet of Curiosity</em>, where I was lucky enough to illustrate a story by Holly Black. I&#8217;ve just completed a book with Tor &#8212; a comic book version of Jeff Vandermeer&#8217;s novella <em>The Situation</em>. We are also collaborating on a second book together.</p>
<p>My work has been featured in <em>The Totoro Project</em> and I&#8217;ve been included in the Society of Illustrators exhibition. I&#8217;ve won the silver in the Spectrum Awards for Fantastic Art. I&#8217;ve also won the Mayor&#8217;s Award for Illustration in my home town, Halifax. At the moment my main project is <em>Maddy Kettle</em>, an all-ages series of graphic novels published by Top Shelf that I wrote and am drawing. This is my dream project. It should be out next year.  </p>
<p><em>Where did you go to school for art?</em></p>
<p>I completed a bachelor of fine arts at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. I took an interdisciplinary degree but focused on painting, drawing and art history. I think the art history impacted my work as much as any practical instruction I had there.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em> </p>
<p>I wanted to do art because I love comics and illustrated books so much. I also cared about them so much that I just couldn’t conceive of not being a part of that world. My art is driven by stories, it makes me feel connected to stories in a deep way. And I just wanted to make people and places and monsters up. I can&#8217;t overemphasize how amazing that is.</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em> </p>
<p>I have so many heroes in art, I always leave some out. But I&#8217;ll do my best: Arthur Rackham, George Herriman, Walt Kelly, A. B. Frost, Moebius, Jack Kirby, John Bauer, Paul Pope, Guy Davis, Mike Mignola, Gustave Dore, Jaimie Hernandez, R. Crumb, Art Spiegelman, William Joyce, Maurice Sendak, Jim Woodring, The Provensens, J. C. Coll, Howard Pyle, Hayao Miyazaki&#8230; I could go on and on so I&#8217;d better stop here and risk leaving out some important names.</p>

<p><em>What are some of your previous and current projects? Past or present employers?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked in the animation industry for about 14 years here in Vancouver, primarily as a background designer and character designer. I&#8217;ve worked on a lot of lesser known Canadian shows, but the ones that you may have heard of are: <em>Mission Hill</em>, which came out in 2000 on The WB. It wasn&#8217;t given a fair shake by the network, but it has a small cult following. I also did character design on <em>My Little Pony</em> season two, which has a very strong cult following.</p>
<p>In 2006 I published a comic called <em>RabbitHead</em>, which is a wordless comic that branches out into many different narratives, but eventually comes together to end where it began. Currently I&#8217;m working on a <em>Battle Kittens</em> graphic novel &#8212; a comic about warrior women who ride giant kittens into battle and have crazy sword-and-sorcery adventures. This is basically me returning to what brought me joy as a kid, watching all those monster movies and terrible <em>Conan</em> rip-offs in the eighties. I&#8217;m having a blast, and I hope that translates into the work.</p>
<p><em>Did you go to school for art, or are you self-taught?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to art school or animation school, however, I am loathe to use the term &#8220;self-taught.&#8221; I feel that you learn the most by hanging out with artists who are more talented than yourself. You also have to never stop learning, and keep your mind open to new things. There&#8217;s a great Ukrainian saying: “What good is the world being so wide, if your heart is so narrow?”</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em></p>
<p>When I was six years old I drew a picture of “Animals From Mars,” and on the opposite side of the paper, I drew “Plants From Mars.” From then on I was hooked; the scope of the human imagination is limitless. As a pathologically shy kid, this allowed me to create a world I felt comfortable in, and as I grew into my confidence I had the skill set to make it into a living, although a meager one. Besides, if I wasn&#8217;t doing this I&#8217;d probably be washing dishes somewhere.</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em></p>
<p>My husband. We don&#8217;t draw the same subject matter, but he draws right next to me and I can always trust his opinion. There is also my &#8220;mews&#8221; Orson Kittyman, who sits on my lap at the art desk and helps me out with <em>Battle Kitten</em> anatomy.</p>

<p><em>What are some of your projects? What is your studio space like?</em></p>
<p>I do my illustration work from home. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have a little studio space that I sometimes refer to as “the batcave”. It&#8217;s got all my favorite stuff in it (supplies, books, computer) and it&#8217;s right beside the kitchen, which means I am just steps away from the coffeemaker at all times. I also work part time as a Junior Designer in an office with some really cool people.</p>
<p>As far as illustration projects go, I just finished a book jacket for a Canadian small press publisher, and right now I&#8217;m working on storyboards for a music video. I like to keep myself busy working on my portfolio or sketching or studying something. I&#8217;m trying to work on some portfolio pieces that do not have tentacles or fetuses floating in glow-y jars.</p>
<p><em>Are you going to school for art?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m just finishing up a Bachelor of Design degree at OCADU [Ontario College of Art and Design] in the Illustration stream. I feel as if I owe a great deal of my education to people outside of university as well. A lot of my personal learning has come from encouraging and talented people who have been kind enough to dole out advice or kick me in the pants, whatever the occasion calls for.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been really into drawing, but I think that must be true of every kid with a pencil. I just kept at it; my science teacher in high school used to confiscate my sketchbook at the door. I remember those classes as being very, very long.</p>
<p>I was actually kind of apprehensive about going into art because it&#8217;s not exactly the most practical career path. For a year I waffled between art and doing something “more sensible.” (For some reason I thought this more-sensible thing was history &#8212; I have no idea where I got that idea!) Thankfully friends and family intervened, which is great because I would be one miserable historian. The idea of not having gone into art seems ridiculous now.</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em></p>
<p>So many things! Blank sketchbooks, peeking in other people&#8217;s sketchbooks, fresh bottles of ink, drawings of any kind, full bookshelves, those tiny drawers stuffed with pen nibs at the art store; a long list of illustrators, comic artists, painters and other crafty people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The needle carves into the skin.  It stabs deep into those cutaneous layers you learned about in science class and lays the ink down.  Bits of blood bubble up and out.  First comes the awful sensation &#8212; a shard of glass dragging across you &#8212; then, the “why am I doing this?,” followed by the warm intoxicating whirring of hot pain.  Steadily vibrating, the pen darkens each line.  The artist dips into her tiny buckets of paint.  Your jaw clenches and you breathe through your teeth.  You feel alive.  Your skin is both map and terrain.</em></p>
<p>I got my first tattoo after my cousin Irene died.  Two blue swallows flying on my back, partly traditional in style (meaning of the old-school sailor look) and partly old-timey cartoonish.  You see the traditional in the simple forms and color scheme.  You see the cartooning in the birds’ button toes, their eyes shaped like little pies with a slice cut out.  In sailing culture, swallow tattoos recognize and commemorate the milestones of the journeyer &#8212; one who travels far from home and comes back again.  One who is both anchored and free.  The bird in ink marks the number of miles, how far one has gone, tallying the math in bodily hieroglyphics. </p>
<p>Irene was/is my cousin.  A diminutive Mexican woman with soft stubby fingers and eyebrows drawn on in fawn pencil.  She lived the spare life of a nun &#8212; if nunneries allowed drinking, smoking and soap opera watching after daily mass.  Raised by my grandmother and great aunt, she was/is bound to our family more closely than the bloodlines express.   She showered me with gifts—toys in those plastic bubbles from quarter machines, packets of sugar-water in wax soda bottles, jokes written on napkins tucked away in her purse.  These things were precious tiny treasures.   Small like me, the child, and her, the teeny old lady, these trinkets bespoke an inversely huge care.  A woman with nothing always had time and money to give me little somethings.  Always, always, without fail. </p>
<p>Everything in Irene’s  tiny apartment was brown and beige, dusty-colored and small as if to forever remind one of the Depression she lived through.  One spot of blue perched above her chair always caught my eye: a jewel-eyed turquoise ceramic bird, beak smiling toward the sky, a counterpoint to the crucifixes and woe-eyed idols protecting each wall.

The veiny center of this heart is the interstate highway I traveled so many times.  The artistic style is borrowed from a Mexican Bingo card &#8212; a kitschy reminder of childhood, place, and play.  I’ve written my (New)Mexicanness there where my white skin forgot to write it.  Home and family, humor and beauty.  A choice long in the making, this tattoo is my favorite and feels the most mine.  People want to know what it means.  They stop me wanting to look more closely. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wayne Barlowe is a living legend in the world of science fiction painting and creature art. Classically-trained at The Cooper Union, he became an award-winning author at age twenty-one with his first painted book, <em>Barlowe&#8217;s Guide to Extraterrestrials</em> (1979). Since then, his work has been seen in <em>Life</em>, <em>Time</em> and <em>Newsweek</em> magazines, on trading cards and on The Discovery Channel, in galleries and on hundreds of book covers. In the nineties, his science fiction and fantasy art books <em>Expedition</em> (1990), <em>The Alien Life of Wayne Barlowe</em> (1995) and <em>Barlowe’s Guide to Fantasy</em> (1996) secured his place as an artist’s artist and fan favorite. In the 2000s, he become synonymous with the arsenal of work he produced about Hell &#8212; from books of paintings and drawings to his critically-acclaimed debut novel, <em>God’s Demon</em> (Tor Books, 2007). He’s now one of Hollywood’s most sought-after creature designers and concept artists, contributing to such films as <em>Avatar</em> (2009), <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> (2004), <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> (2005), <em>The Hobbit</em> (2012) and most recently, Guillermo del Toro’s upcoming <em>Pacific Rim</em> (2013). Today, I have the honor of speaking with Wayne about his projects, his inspirations, his processes and the underworld that’s filled his work for a decade.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>Your parents Sy and Dorothea Barlowe were well-known natural history artists, which I assume laid the groundwork for the refined knowledge you now have of anatomy. Did you spend much time drawing under your parents’ instruction as a child? Drawing animals from life? What were your childhood artistic years like?</em></p>
<p>My education was, primarily, by osmosis. Growing up with working, professional artists inculcated me with a sense of self-discipline and an appreciation for the degree of hard work that went into doing illustrations and putting books together. It was a slow process and the time-consuming, painstaking effort that went into doing scientifically accurate work was not lost on me. It imbued me with a personal desire to “get it right,” to measure twice and cut once, as the saying goes. And that philosophy layered itself atop my love of biology, anatomy and all things scientific. Okay, so I was an odd child. I drew constantly and my parents were both honest and encouraging. I rarely drew animals from life but we did have a ton of dried specimens and other natural objects which I did enjoy trying to render. But my interests in SF, Fantasy, WWI and ancient Rome skewed the drawings and I veered off from my parents’ work pretty early on. My school notebooks were filled with marginalia and studies of all kinds of things. The freedom was fun. I didn’t really get a handle on paint until I was in my mid teens. I had gone to an art and music camp for a few summers on Long Island and picked up acrylics there. They were a relatively new medium and I learned their attributes pretty quickly. I owe my continued use of them to those summers. My parents worked in gouache and I never really got the hang of it &#8212; the fact that you could re-activate the paint beneath annoyed me. But I was very happy with the fast drying speed of acrylics and the greater body. Once I got bitten by the paint bug, I was forever changed. I did a ton of work in my old, cluttered room. I painted a lot of aliens, and robots and Picts and you name it. Eventually, I managed to put a portfolio of paintings together (mostly imaginative stuff) and I was accepted into Cooper Union.   </p>
<p><em>Your first book</em> Barlowe&#8217;s Guide to Extraterrestrials <em>(1979) was published when you were only twenty-one, and remains an earmark of modern science fiction illustration still today. Since then, you’ve rendered and crafted countless creatures while rotating seamlessly between alien, prehistoric and horror imagery. Are there projects from your career that stand out as more challenging or more rewarding than others?</em> </p>

I had just left Cooper early and was more than ready to go out and conquer the world. I came up with the idea over a beer with my parents &#8212; it was the perfect merging of what they did with what I wanted to do in the world of science fiction. I probably could not come close to producing it as quickly as I did way back then. And, I’m not so keen on the quality of it these days. I was a kid and it was the perfect project for me back in 1979. <em>Expedition</em> was a real challenge. I had been painting covers for quite some time and had gotten into a rut. It was not a comfortable rut either. I realized, luckily, that I was losing touch with myself and simply jumping from one cover to the next without any thoughts other than those of pleasing sometimes arbitrary art directors. It was a dead end. So, I gambled with <em>Expedition</em>. I took the leap and did a painting and put together a proposal and sold it. And then had to spend three years working on it! It was a great, stimulating project and led to many other great projects, but it was pretty taxing. I was doing the artwork (30+ paintings and over a hundred drawings) and the writing (which, at that time, I was even more uncertain of than I am today) and the back/forth was daunting. On a positive note, I learned how the written word could catalyze images and vice versa. All in all, it was a struggle, complete with editorial battles, but very much worth it in the end.</p>
<p>Writing <em>God’s Demon</em> was, in a different way, even more challenging because while I had done some forty or so paintings in the Hell universe, I never considered myself a novelist. I still don’t. But here I was suddenly holding a contract in my hands and tasked with writing the epic story of Hell, of bringing together all of my paintings and eighteen years of thoughts into one comprehensive work. I don’t think a day went by when I didn’t ask myself what new, self-delusional form of hubris had been invented to enable me to think I could do this. It didn’t help that towards the end, when all of my creative juices were urging me on to finish the damned thing, I suddenly got called away to work on <em>AVATAR</em>. I had, insanely, thought I could write on weekends. It never happened. That book was probably the single hardest, creative endeavor to date.</p>
<p><em>I heard that you used sea life as an inspiration for some of the designs you worked on for</em> Avatar<em>. Can you share a little more about this and about your artistic involvement on the film as creature designer? Your art sensibility seems very well-suited to the production.</em></p>
<p>Thank you. Actually, only the sweeping lines and curves and detailing of cetaceans made their way into my early, personal design bible for <em>AVATAR</em>. A lot of that got dialed back, too. I was the first person called in on <em>AVATAR</em> and I remember how nervous and excited I was to be in the first wave, along with the three other talented designers under me, on such an ambitious project. It was such a deep, black-ops phase that not even the person who much later wrote the <em>Art Of</em> book was aware of us! Working with Jim was a blast &#8212; a true peak experience. After listening carefully to him I went down a path wherein I started to blend the aforementioned cetacean lines with Formula 1 car elements and added a dollop of amphibian skin for good measure. Big air scoops to accommodate and visually convey the denser air, large, flat skin surfaces for bold markings, pinched anatomical curves to suggest speed and power and plain alien-ness. I was doing some pretty strange things to animal forms and Jim liked it but, quite wisely, pulled me back. After all, it was his vision for Pandora and he had a very clear idea of where he wanted to go. I think, in hindsight, my earliest designs might have been too extreme and not relatable to a larger audience. That’s Jim’s genius &#8212; to know what will speak to people. <em>AVATAR</em> was a rich and amazing project and will remain, for me, a high-water mark in every way.</p>
<p><em>You also worked as a concept artist for the films</em> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban <em>and</em> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire<em>. There have never been art books for any of the Harry Potter movies, correct? Are you able to tell us about your design contributions to</em> Harry Potter <em>3 and 4?</em></p>
<p>There is a book out now, but sadly, I am not mentioned. That happens. <em>Art Of</em> books come out so long after production that the lines of communication and awareness constrict until only the last few people are there to discuss the projects. It’s a shame because a lot of people deserve a lot of credit for their work but the last men standing simply aren’t aware of their contributions. Anyway, on <em>HP3</em> I designed the werewolf, made major contributions on the hippogriff, designed the monster books, the Hogwarts ghosts. On <em>HP4</em> I had a lesser role, but I did work extensively on the Death Eaters’ costumes, the dragons, the shark kid, Mad-eyed Moody’s artificial leg and a few other elements. </p>
<p><em>Your first novel</em> God’s Demon <em>(2007) was preceded by your art books about Hell (</em>Barlowe’s Inferno <em>[1998] and</em> Brushfire: Illuminations from the Inferno <em>[2001]), as well by as your 2000 screenplay, </em>Inferno: Rebellion in Hell<em>. The novel fleshes out ideas touched upon in all three of these works, which is part of what made it such a rich, ambitious and far-reaching narrative. Did it ever feel daunting to be working up a story based off a larger creative manifesto, rather than working within the confines of a more limited concept or stand-alone novel outline?</em></p>

On the one hand, I had the screenplay which served as a really good underpinning for the writing. And I had all of those annoying paintings and drawings which kept pushing their way into the process. They actually did a fine job of serving as visual touchstones for me. But once I started to get further into the writing, my spit-balled estimate of three pages of manuscript to one page of script started to go away. In other words, the book started to take on a life of its own and the script morphed into becoming a good skeleton to drape the narrative on. The script and the paintings were more of a resource to tap into than a burden. But I did feel the pressure of trying to get as much into the book as I could simply to mark out the territory and make it as real as I could.</p>
<p><em>One of most chilling attributes of the Hell depicted in your work is the sheer vastness of it, which imbues the place with an other-worldly hopelessness. The idea of a boundless landscape as a prison &#8212; where going anywhere leads you nowhere &#8212; reinforces notion that the suffering is inescapable because the space it is housed by is infinite. How did you come up with this idea which is a contrast to the typical, finite underworld or leveled Hell we’re accustomed to seeing?</em></p>

The world of Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> seemed too limiting to me &#8212; a series of rings that by definition are constraining. Clearly, that was appealing hundreds of years ago and something that the public could relate to. Later, Milton expanded upon it and made his Hell feel more like a dark region, a world that somehow existed but was vast. I ran with that ball. We live in an era where we are just beginning to understand the vastness of the universe and see it depicted in films. I could not have created a world for Hell that would have been any less expansive. I sometimes played with the idea of layering a temporal element to Hell &#8212; a kind of string-theory approach that would have involved multiple Hells that could co-exist but only be joined in certain locations. I had this crazy desire to show what humanity would evolve into and then place them in Hell next to our more familiar form. It was a rough concept but not one that found its way into the story. </p>
<p><em>You’re an avid reader with an extensive knowledge of traditional literature and classical science fiction. Looking at the text accompaniments in your art books, it’s not surprising that you branched out into writing. Did you write much fiction in your spare time before you began your first screenplay in 1999?</em></p>
<p>I dabbled. I wrote a treatment for an old college project that people have asked me about for years &#8212; <em>Thype</em>. I still have to do something with that. I also tried a couple of short stories but they were small experiments. Nothing more. The screenplay came out of my love for the form. I think it’s particularly well-suited to me because of its obvious visual component. And I love narrative. So it’s a perfect blend. I suspect I will be writing more of them. </p>
<p><em>People have said that</em> God’s Demon <em>is in good company with classical works like Milton’s </em>Paradise Lost <em>and Dante’s </em>Inferno<em>. The characters in </em>God’s Demon<em> have an elevated capacity for humanity &#8212; though they are not technically human &#8212; which draws the reader to empathize and feel invested in their struggle. Sadness, regret, will, a yearning for redemption, a desensitization to the suffering of others and a wish to feel sympathy &#8212; these big themes are as pertinent to worldly suffering as they are to the idea of punishment in eternity. Was this an early part of the narrative, or did it come out organically as you crafted the story? How important was it to you to “humanize” Hell?</em> </p>

I tried hard to write something that would last and be engaging for a long time. That’s one of the reasons you find very few references to actual people in Hell, let alone any references to modern touchstones. And that’s also the reason I chose to “humanize” the demons. While I wanted them to be strange and, in some ways, distant, I did not want a reader to completely disassociate from their situation. It’s entertainment and by definition one needs to be able to relate to the struggles a character you are reading and enjoying is undergoing. All of the emotions you listed are, indeed, human but there is no reason to suggest that demons or angels would not feel them. Were I writing about true aliens I would probably have pushed further away from those emotions. But, if you buy the canon, the angels and demons were created by the same hand as we were. So, it makes sense that they would have the same kinds of emotions. And, that is pretty much how Milton, my spiritual muse on this project, envisioned them as well. His characters are the epitome of the emotions they display &#8212; nobility becomes Nobility, pride becomes Pride.</p>
<p><em>Well put. One of the visualizations that carried over from</em> Barlowe’s Inferno <em>to </em>God’s Demon <em>is the image of each of the condemned souls carrying their sins around in a heavy, black sphere, visible as a mobile and tumor-like orb in their form. Did utilizing these and other elements from your visual work make plotting the framework for</em> God’s Demon <em>easier, or was it a challenge to string together the components you wanted to retain for the novel?</em></p>
<p>The heavy-lifting of plotting was pretty much mapped-out and determined by the screenplay. For the novel, I added scenes as they seemed necessary, recognizing that I had more elbow-room and no real parameters with its length. And, by the time I began to write <em>God’s Demon</em>, I obviously knew I would not have the luxury of the artwork accompanying the text which was a mixed blessing &#8212; it forced me to be more descriptive but made the book a bit heavy on the visuals &#8212; something today’s readers are not always happy with. Luckily, more people than not enjoyed that degree of description. I very much wanted a reader who had seen my artwork to recognize scenes or elements from the paintings so it was important to make sure that I didn’t miss putting in anything key. That part &#8212; sprinkling in bits of from the art &#8212; was actually fun. For me, kind of like when you eat a bowl of Lucky Charms and you find a nice little marshmallow in with the cereal. But not all of the art is represented. Some of it was less narrative and just wasn’t appropriate to the greater story.</p>
<p><em>Creatively, how do your approaches differ between writing and visual art? Do painting and drawing come more easily to you since you’ve done them longer?</em> </p>
<p>Without a doubt, my artwork is much easier to generate. I’ve been doing it since I was a child whereas I have only been writing seriously for six or seven years. I truly labor over the writing and, when I’m really stuck, ponder how real writers do it. Probably with as little effort as I draw. If I say that I draw and paint more easily I’m not actually implying that I am satisfied with it. I can’t look at my artwork a week after I’ve done it. If my self-criticism is bad with art, it’s off the charts when it comes to my writing. As for my methods of writing, I made a lot of small notes on index cards for both the novel and the screenplays I’ve written. They are handy and I can tear them up with impunity if I don’t like the thought or even the way it’s written on the card. My notes are pretty neat and concise. Similar in tone with the thumbnail sketches I do in my notebooks. Though, I will say the thumbnails for my paintings are sometimes pretty sketchy. At this point in my career, I’m pretty practiced at taking a rough thumb and turning it into a painting. And, I also like the many small things that happen if you wing it with paint and are not slavish to a sketch. But, then, there’s the painting I finished that has four paintings beneath it&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Speaking of painting, I’m curious about your process and the types of materials you use. Depending on the needs of the project, do you prefer oils or acrylics? How large do you typically work when painting for yourself or for personal projects?</em></p>
<p>I only use acrylics. I used to use Lascaux acrylics from Switzerland but I have, in recent years, switched to Golden brand. Domestically produced, easier to find and almost the same quality. I prefer the paint to dry matte and the other brands don’t achieve that. I use Winsor &amp; Newton watercolor brushes for the finer detail and many different brands for the flats. I generally paint on Gessoboard because it’s not hard to get, is archival and relatively tough. I don’t work larger than 24&#8243; X 36” and have been gravitating to 16&#8243; X 20” lately. I will frequently put down a colored ground or go right to blocking in the background and then take pastels and block in the foreground elements. Nothing very unique about that. The acrylics are fairly forgiving and I can erase mistakes easily. As well as paint out big problems. Like entire paintings when I don’t like them!</p>
<p><em>Can you tell us what you have in the works right now? Any plans for a sequel to </em>God’s Demon<em> in the future?</em></p>

Safe to say, it is not set in Hell or any other universe I have created. I am also under contract to write a screenplay based on <em>God’s Demon</em> as well as a sequel to the novel. That book will be entitled <em>The Heart of Hell</em> and centers around Lilith and the Salamandrines. And, for those who’ve asked, many of the characters from the first book will be reappearing. I’ve gotten a bit into it and it’s giving me the opportunity to further expand Hell and the world-building that I so enjoy.</p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>As a performer I&#8217;m known for my dark, out of the box acts—messy, outrageous, sometimes borderline offensive. I do have my moments of pretty, feminine acts, but on the whole I think I&#8217;m more known for pushing boundaries, and if I happen to come across as sexy while doing it, so much the better. My modeling tends to contain that same aesthetic, and I would say my sarcastic, black-humor-tinged outlook on life as well.</p>
<p>I have been seen in short films for Nokia, been featured on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, have danced with Natalie Portman in <em>Black Swan</em>, posed nude for foreign magazine fashion spreads, worn priceless designer couture with Q Models in fashion videos, walked the runway for impeccable gothic designers, shot fetish films in Newcastle, graced the stages of legendary NYC nightclubs, and so much more! It&#8217;s been a wild ride!  </p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m always thinking up new acts for my regular burlesque residency with Original Cyn Burlesque at the Lucky 13 Saloon in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I&#8217;m also looking forward to getting my foot in the door with new shows and venues &#8212; right now I&#8217;m excited to be performing with Geek Girl Productions again, for Edification for the first time, and of course with my favorite underground NYC party <em>TRASH!</em> at Webster Hall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been doing a lot of television and film work recently. I just did featured background work on a new show for HBO called <em>Spring/Fall</em> starring Tea Leoni and Sigourney Weaver. You will also be able to catch me on upcoming episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order: CI</em>, <em>How To Make It In America</em>, <em>Men In Black 3</em> and many more to come.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a dancer and performer?</em></p>
<p>I grew up dancing. My mother had been a ballerina and when I was old enough to walk, she decided it was time for me to start ballet lessons. I continued with ballet until well into college, when I took a break to focus on my BFA in Media Arts/Animation at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. A few years after moving to New York I started modeling, and a DJ gave me my first real “start” as a burlesque performer at the infamous <em>Rated X: The Panty Party</em> at Luke &amp; Leroy’s. I didn&#8217;t really know that I was doing &#8220;burlesque&#8221; per se &#8212; I had choreographed a dance number and incorporated some strip elements into it. After that I started gogo dancing at various downtown parties for fun, and then in 2008 I was approached by the amazing Fem Appeal who runs <em>Kitty Nights Burlesque</em> every Sunday at Bar on A. She asked me to debut at her show, and from there the ball started rolling. I was very lucky in the sense that people have been willing to give me a shot sight-unseen, or by word of mouth. That&#8217;s not always easy to do in this town!</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>“Go big or go home.”<br />
“A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.”<br />
“If not now, when?”</p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I moved to New York as a theatrical performer in 2010, having done shows such as <em>bare</em>, <em>The Wild Party</em>, <em>A Few Good Men</em>, <em>Side Show</em>, <em>La Cage aux Folles</em>, and more. I&#8217;ve also done drag for almost four years now, and have always had a passion for makeup &#8212; I even went to school in full face every day of my sophomore year in high school in conservative Cave Creek, Arizona. I&#8217;m 6’5” and both of my parents were models, so I got pushed into that as soon as I was old enough. I&#8217;m known for my strange personality, and for being kind while being dressed like a bitch.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>Right now I’m working on a few parties that I will be starting, and I&#8217;ve been altering and making a lot of my clothes. I have some offers for shows (theatre) lately that I&#8217;m juggling and can&#8217;t really talk about yet. I&#8217;m looking to start working on music more since that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m the most versed in, and I&#8217;m pulling a lot of inspiration from my significant other.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a performer and model?</em></p>
<p>I became everything that I am, and that I do, because it gives you a key to open minds and challenge people&#8217;s thoughts and beliefs. I like to make people question themselves because if we all plateau intellectually, we might as well be dead. Individuality is not only attainable by some, you just need to tell society to piss off and live life for yourself.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in hate, and I believe that “regret is like drinking a glass of poison and waiting for someone else to die.” I believe that if you want something you should go for it. And I believe that if you need to put down others to get to where you want to be, and if you keep hidden agendas and secrets, you don&#8217;t deserve to achieve your dreams. Live, love, and keep your chin up.</p>

<p><em>Nadia Aboulhosn’s self-styled photos have been featured on fashion blogs and sites all around the web, including teenvogue.com. Says Nadia:</em></p>
<p>I am known for pushing limits and breaking barriers. I am known for doing what I want despite society&#8217;s views and beliefs.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em> </p>
<p>My creative energy is focused on my fashion blog and my future career in fashion. I am constantly in competition with myself to outdo what I previously did before. I am currently in the process of building a portfolio to apply for fashion school in New York. I am looking to start my own shoe line, style people other than myself, and possibly start modeling. All in all, my desire is to eventually become a fashion icon and inspire people everywhere. I just got done with a photo-shoot for <em>Seventeen Magazine</em> that will be out in November 2011. They used me to model some of their clothes. </p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue fashion?</em></p>
<p>Designing and styling always came easy to me. Fashion is the only thing that excites me, so making it my career is only right. Through art, people are able to express themselves whether it&#8217;s  drawing, painting, or music. Fashion, to me, is another form of art. It is a way for me to express myself. </p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em> </p>
<p>Never compromise. Settling is never an option. Dictate your own life while thinking intelligently rather than emotionally. </p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I am known for bending the gender lines in a way no one has done before. My extreme ways of expressing myself are quite delicious to some. Some call me the &#8220;Master of Masquerade&#8221;, and I like that. I&#8217;ve been on the cover of <em>Quest Magazine</em> (Wisconsin&#8217;s LGBT Mag) and just recently took an artistic risk in my newest short movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqEwQCCA6Q0" target="_blank">&#8220;Angel&#8217;s Ashes,&#8221;</a> which was just released on YouTube. But most of my success has come from the internet, winning photo contests and such&#8230; so far&#8230;</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I aspire to take over the world. To act, to move people. Continue with photography and creating photos that twist people&#8217;s minds into endless questions. I aspire to be on the cover of national magazines and to help people find the courage to run with fire, come into their own and be truly comfortable with who they are.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a model, performer and artist?</em></p>
<p>I always felt like I wanted to make the world a better place. I was always the weird, awkward one that everyone was leery about. I scratched the walls of my small town until my nails bled. Now I&#8217;m exploring every possible facet of life and entertainment, and I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>Eat the brains of life! [laughs] Or:<br />
&#8220;Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well.&#8221; &#8211;Josh Billings<br />
&#8220;Be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love, work, play and to look up at the stars.&#8221; &#8211;Henry Van Dyke</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Konig’s resume is staggering. The visual effects artist, conceptual designer and animator has worked on a massive list of feature films, including <em>Dragonheart</em> (1996), <em>Starship Troopers</em> (1997), <em>Beowulf</em> (2007), <em>Enchanted</em> (2007), <em>Splice</em> (2009) and countless others. Konig was also the art director of <em>Evolution</em> (2001), as well as a contributing talent to the video games <em>Portal 2</em> and <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>. Today, I have the honor of talking with this art and design Renaissance man about his long and varied career in visual effects, his years with Tippett Studio, his recent work with the video game company VALve Software, and the personal fine art projects that keep him up at night.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p><em>You started work in the industry when you were very young. How did you decide that conceptual  design and visual effects in film was something you wanted to pursue? Were you schooled specifically for this industry, or was it one you fell into because of the skills you already possessed?</em></p>

I had a few heroes like legendary makeup effects artists Rick Baker and Dick Smith; I mainly just wanted to do what they did or try to work for them somehow. I saw their work and others at a pretty young age, nine or ten years old, and it kind of set me on this path. Of course, movies like <em>Godzilla</em> (1954) and <em>Planet of the Apes</em> (1968) already had me headed in the movie monster direction, but finding out about the guys behind the work I loved made me realize that this is an actual job a person could have. That’s when I set about finding out all I could on how things were done. It quickly became apparent that drawing and sculpting were things to practice if I was ever to get into the field. Computers weren’t really on the map at that point.</p>
<p><em>Your early career began with Tippett Studio, and you joined them just as they began to shift from stop animation to computer-generated imagery for Jurassic Park in 1991. In the early 90s, you were doing some sculpting for puppetry and onscreen effects as well as creating maquettes for CGI imaging. Now, the sculpting you do for film is almost exclusively for a CGI end result. How is sculpting for CGI different than sculpting for puppetry or stop-motion animation? Do you ever miss working on onscreen or ‘old-fashioned’ effects?</em></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> It’s not that different as far as how you think about what you’re trying to accomplish. You are still using many of the same parts of your brain and your creativity, but yeah, the hands on, getting dirty part is missing completely. I do miss it even though CGI is more efficient and quicker. I loved working with clay and plastics and paint all day, though at the same time I am perfectly happy not to have to breath chemical fumes any more. It was also a much more physical job back then. Now I sit at a desk 10 hours a day and move my hand around a little. I should mention that I do believe that people who have hands on, traditional experience with creating shapes and surfaces have a better understanding of the art; it’s just an additional layer of experience that adds another level of quality to the work.</p>
<p><em>You’re known partly for your creature design. When you’re designing something like a dragon, for example&mdash;like those you developed for </em>Dragonheart<em> and </em>Enchanted<em>&mdash;you’re working on a creature that already has a strong mythos, but that you have to give its own unique spin for a new story. What challenges do you face building a creature with a pre-existing ‘lore’ versus creating one that’s not based in any other legend or history?</em></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="5290" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/05/04/interview-with-peter-konig/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted.jpg" data-orig-size="454,525" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted.jpg?w=259" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted.jpg?w=454" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted.jpg?w=259&#038;h=300" alt="dragons" title="petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted" width="259" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5290" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted.jpg?w=259&amp;h=300 259w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted.jpg?w=130&amp;h=150 130w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/petes-dragons-dragonheart-enchanted.jpg 454w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px" /> <strong>PK:</strong> That’s tricky to answer. A lot of what I do is try to understand the needs of the production, what they need out of the character. If I’m lucky enough to get in early, before they know what they want, I can try to throw characteristics in there that make sense to me, or things I’d like to try, keeping the story, time period and stuff like that in mind. More often than not, the production or the director has a certain look he’s going for and my job is then to try to give them what they want while also trying to add my personal touches. As far as the lore goes, the few dragons I’ve worked on for the most part have been for original stories and there was a fair amount of freedom. But If I was working on something like <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> movies, where the audience and the director have been living for years with the books and have certain histories and descriptions already there, it’s another story completely. For me personally and the way I work, I try not to get overly influenced by the lore and the traditional designs from years ago. My attitude is to try to make things fresh and as different as I can get away with, whether it’s a dragon, mermaid or completely new creature that’s never been done before.</p>
<p><em>In addition to 3D work, you also do a lot of beautiful conceptual design in 2D form&mdash;key frames, environments, as well as animation. Is there a particular role that is more gratifying for you as an artist? Is it refreshing to have a rotation of change-ups in medium, or is there one you’d prefer to do exclusively?</em></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> I definitely have my comfort zones. Anything monstrous or scary is right up my alley and I don’t usually have much trouble there. But change is very good and keeps you on your toes and constantly evolving as an artist. Working in styles and subjects and mediums that vary is a great way to stretch and get exercise, and it only helps improve the stuff you really love working on. I do like to be diverse if for no reason other than to keep employed. If you can do a decent job with many subjects you’ll always be working.</p>
<p><em>What have been some of your favorite projects or experiences working in film?</em></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> <em>Jurassic Park</em> (1993) stands out for me, even though I didn’t get to do too much on it. Looking back I was really lucky to be a witness at a key moment in special effects history when computer graphics really took over as the way to put fantastic characters in a movie. I remember the early tests from ILM [Industrial Light &amp; Magic] and Tippett, seeing them for the first time and really understanding that this was important and momentous <em>Starship Troopers</em> (1997) was also an amazing experience because there was such an exciting gung-ho attitude at Tippett, so much neat stuff was happening all at once. I also got to do many interesting jobs, from sculpting creature maquettes to animating. It was one of those big growth moments for the company and for me professionally. And there was so much work being done, it was always exciting and stimulating and we all had such a sense of accomplishment when it finally was done. The most recent movie work I did was working with Guillermo del Toro on preliminary designs for H. P. Lovecraft’s <em>At the Mountains of Madness</em>. Sadly it’s been put on hold, but having the chance work with Guillermo and the amazing concept artists like Wayne Barlowe and Guy Davis was a real honor for me.</p>

<p><em>Since 2009, you’ve also been an artist at the game company VALVe Software, creator of the </em>Half-Life<em>, </em>Portal<em> and </em>Left 4 Dead<em> games, and online gaming platform, Steam. Can you tell us about what you do there? Is it very different than working on film effects and design?</em></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> At VALVe I work primarily in concept, modeling and texture. It’s a very different work environment from film. With effects and design for film, you’re always under the pressure of the production schedule, which gets shorter every year it seems. VALVe has the luxury of putting out products when they’re ready and encouraging a lot of experimentation. In addition, you’re really on your own to figure out what your job is and what you should be doing. There’s nobody chasing you around with a clipboard reminding you of your next task. You really have to be independent and self-starting to be successful there, yet at the same time, you have to be good at working within a team. I’ve also noticed that there’s a lot less ego in what I’m doing right now. We’re trying as a team of people to make a great product that we and the fans will love.</p>
<p><em>What are some of the games you’ve worked on for VALVe?</em></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> I&#8217;ve only been here two and a half years, but so far I’ve worked on <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, a bit on <em>Portal 2</em>, and some other projects I can&#8217;t mention yet. All really fun stuff. I was a VALVe fan long before getting a job here, so I&#8217;m really loving it.</p>
<p><em>I see you are doing more fine art these days. Is that something you plan to make more of a transition to?</em></p>

When you have a family and a house and all that good stuff, you have to earn a living. I’d love to someday have the choice to do fine art full-time, but it’s just not possible yet. Nevertheless, I work at it whenever I can; lots of late nights. Right now I’m just in this exploration mode, trying to find a place in that world for me. It’s tricky when you love to do so many different things. Should I paint today? Should I sculpt? Draw? I’m a little all over the map right now, and I think it has a lot to do with having such limited time for it.</p>
<p><em>What influences or inspires you for your fine art projects?</em></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> This is such a hard thing to talk about for me. When I let my mind go, I get glimpses of what I’m after. It’s not solid or direct, like painting existing things&mdash;people, nature. It’s like there’s a world on the other side of my brain, just out of reach. It has similarities to our world but it’s all out of focus, like when your eyes don’t work right in a dream. You try to make things out but you just can’t get any clarity. I just see flashes of objects, figures, environments, textures. But I can’t really put my finger on it or describe what I see perfectly. Making things is a way for me to try to tease out what I’ve always had floating somewhere in the back of my head. Goofy, I know, but what can I tell you&mdash;it’s a bit of a mystery to me too. I’m certainly inspired and influenced by other artists, though their work may be really different than what I’m after. I love dark stuff like Witkin, Beksinski, Giger. But I’m equally interested in Jenny Saville’s paintings, Richard Diebenkorn, Joe Sorren, John Currin, Ron Pippin. As far as what I like, the list is really long and it all makes an impression on me and affects how I approach my work.</p>
<p><em>I noticed a toy prototype on your website as well. Is that a personal project?</em></p>
<p><strong>PK:</strong> Yeah&mdash;speaking of being a little all over the place. I’d really love to do some very strange art toys or collectibles. That little bunny suited guy isn’t the most original idea, I had done a little digital 3D sketch and was just playing with a 3D printer I have access too. But yes, I have a bunch of toy ideas and they’re just not right. I’d be certainly be interested in doing a series of toys that like-minded individuals would appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, this week I’m idling on location in not-so-sunny, slightly snowy, Washington D.C. The lady I’m vacationing with is out taking the bar exam for some reason and I’m tucked in my cushy One Washington Circle Hotel bed writing to you. Late yesterday afternoon we decided to do as the D.C. tourists do and get ourselves to a museum.  </p>
<p>But, bad news, everyone! Apparently museum knowledge is only up for grabs until 5 pm, so the more popular Smithsonian sights were out of the question. This was less of a letdown for me as I’ve visited said sights before only to realize that I harbor strange museum phobias. The epic architectural spaces designed to mimic historical scale and make one teeny-tiny in comparison to the vastness of the archive, well, this fills me with sublime terror. Heavy machinery and/or the plaster likenesses of avian creatures hanging by slim wire from the ceiling&mdash;along with the possibility of being crushed by said artifacts&mdash;presents another creeping form of agoraphobia that makes me feel like I’m going to tip over. Lastly, giant toothy-mawed skeletal formations and gigantor replicas of hulking beasts of the past kind of make me want to pee myself. Much like the first fear, these replica displays suggest a universal and temporal hugeness that makes my brain hurt. And much like my second fear, I can also imagine scenarios in which the stuffed monster or cage of bones will fall over just so, encasing me in the mouth of mastasaurus terrorificus and, thusly, painfully I die.  </p>
<p>So, all that to say we went to the National Portrait Gallery instead. (They close at 7.) And, score one for the phobe! Portraits do not scare me.  </p>
<p>The gallery is lovely, especially its upper levels with its colorful mosaic floors and decoratively corniced hallways. I also preferred the upstairs spaces because they held the more contemporary artwork. Though some of the early daguerreotype prints were hauntingly impressive, I can only see so many Civil-War-era rich white men captured on film or canvas. The third floor was my contemporary postmodern bread and butter, replete with huge pop-artsy prints depicting bacon. This is also where I found my favorite exhibition; I was completely taken by the art of Alexis Rockman.  </p>
<p>Excited by the name “Alexis,” I was pleased to see what I assumed was a woman’s work. But, Rockman is actually a man. This really only upsets me because I was painfully aware of the overwhelmingly male presence of both the artists and subjects of the portraits and I was excited to see a whole set of rooms devoted to this “Alexis.” Though I was disappointed, I bucked up and continued onward&mdash;I wasn’t going to let a little penis ruin my day. And, bottom line, the dude is an amazing painter.  </p>
<div style="width: 860px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://alexisrockman.net/projects/natural-history"><img alt="Evolution" src="https://i0.wp.com/alexisrockman.net/files/gimgs/37_evolution.jpg" title="Evolution" width="850" height="285" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Evolution, 1992, oil on wood, 96 x 288 in.</p></div>
<p>Rockman’s canvases are large and wide depicting various landscapes with a painterly romantic touch reminiscent of the Hudson River School. The dizzying and even horrific sublime feelings I described above, the affect born of “scary” museum displays, are captured in these portraits with uncanny clarity. Each painting is incredibly detailed in its depiction of past, present and future natural worlds. In one landscape you might see those hideous primeval creatures of the deep gliding though the murky water, something akin to the Loch Ness monster, while just above little reptiles squish their way out of the muck and onto dryer land. Skeletal fish, gelatinous figures, terrible dinosaur-like birds of prey populate an impossible (or is it a soon-to-come and totally possible?) habitat.  </p>
<p>In Rockman’s worlds nature is both abject and beautiful. Weather is Herculean, mythically huge, yet godless.  Pollution and man-made horrors create a contemporary hell. In a number of paintings, horny pigs dot the canvas humping chickens, beavers, or anything they can get their hooves on. The artist forces us to reckon with the ugliness of our scientific splicings and the grandiose downfall of the planet to pollution. He makes us bear witness to encyclopedic depictions of primordial soup not only as our beginning, but also as a future that we bring about ourselves. A future in which we no longer exist.</p>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://alexisrockman.net/projects/wonderful-world"><img alt="Sea World" src="https://i2.wp.com/alexisrockman.net/files/gimgs/20_seaworld200dpi.jpg" title="Sea World" width="600" height="483" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sea World, 2001-04, oil &amp; acrylic on wood panel, 96 x 120 in. </p></div>
<p>Immensely complex, amoebic formations may gestate in the eye of a frog, while that frog performs its role in a much larger ecosystem&mdash;one equally devoted to life and death, beautiful birth and disgusting decay. Teams of insects, arachnids, rats and an endless array of carrion (real remains lacquered into certain pieces) take center stage in Rockman’s work. No mustachioed generals here. He champions the frightening beauty of the shadowy figures that live beneath our feet, or buzzingly tangle in our hair. He pushes us to see the things that dangle and dance at the edges of our being. He paints them, he glorifies them and he makes them visible, powerful. We see ourselves through the cockroach, we recognize ourselves and our ancestry in the monsters of the past and begin to reckon with the monsters that we are and are becoming.  </p>
<p>Another museum experience, again, scarily good.</p>
