										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, my name is Sarah and I&#8217;m an addict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I watched the entire series of <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/United_States_of_Tara/70142349?trkid=2361637">The United States of Tara</a> in 5 days. That&#8217;s 37 half hour episodes. I watched 13 episodes in one day. A Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently two days sober from Netflix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t understand. They think TV is just fun. A frivolous thing you can turn off whenever you like. And what do I know? Maybe that&#8217;s true for some people. Maybe most people have a point where they say &#8220;that&#8217;s enough&#8221; and they can just switch off the remote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your TV make noise? I still have one of those big boxy CRT televisions that makes this hum. It&#8217;s not something I hear so much as I feel. And it&#8217;s not even something I feel so much as I miss. When I turn off the TV there&#8217;s this crackling, like someone just opened a pressure valve and I can breathe again. I know I&#8217;m making it sound unhealthy, like the TV is suffocating me but just think of it like I do, as electronic swaddling. That hum is a seductive sotto voce murmur.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Press play. One more episode. Just one. Just one more. You want to know what comes next. While everything&#8217;s fresh, so fresh in your mind. Can&#8217;t you feel it crackling? That energy between us? It&#8217;s only twenty minutes. It&#8217;s only the rest of the night. It&#8217;s only the rest of the week.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>And then it&#8217;s over. Tara drives off into the sunset, head sticking out of her car window, leaving me back on Netflix&#8217;s menu screen, head sticking out of my duvet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&gt; Play episode one</em></p>
<p>Did I blackout? Where&#8217;d the last 5 days of my life go? Lost into the ether. And for what? <em>The United States of Tara</em> isn&#8217;t a bad show. Arguably it&#8217;s perfect for me. To deal with the stresses of life, Tara loses herself in herself. The rest of us lose ourselves in TV. In her. In her selves. Being just one person is too much for most people but look at all the people she can be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch any show in a marathon binge and you inevitably hate it. Like eating too much ice cream, after a while you stop tasting it because your mouth is too cold. You&#8217;re numb and nauseous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quirks become crutches. Characters become ciphers. Relateability becomes rote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the show&#8217;s fault. TV was designed to be shown one episode per week with commercials in-between. But, while I may be an extreme, who honestly watches TV like that anymore?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not doing a marathon streaming session, you watching episodes back to back on DVD. And if you&#8217;re not watching TV on DVD, then you&#8217;re watching it on Hulu or the show&#8217;s website where there few to no commercial breaks. And if you&#8217;re not watching online, you&#8217;re watching it on a DVR that allows you to fast forward through commercials. Even with live TV I often jump back to hear things I&#8217;ve missed then fast forward through a few commercials. We want more show. More show, less of everything else.</p>
<p>I quit cold turkey from Netflix streaming two days ago. Of course, I&#8217;ll be back. You shouldn&#8217;t plan on relapsing but I know it&#8217;ll happen soon enough. After all, I have to do another column next month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if there&#8217;ll be a software update while I&#8217;m gone. Maybe Netflix will get a play-all button.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If it’s not already obvious here at &#8220;The F Word,&#8221; let me say it: I refuse to diet. I think it is a fine way to lose weight, if that is your goal. However, as a daily eating habit, I just cannot force myself to go without carbs or without meat or without food in general. Everyone I know who diets ends up failing, then beating themselves up about it, then trying some new diet. It seems like some kind of torture to me.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I feel this way is that I’ve never really been an emotional eater. That’s not to say that I don’t enjoy destroying a tub of Ben &amp; Jerry’s or most of the cookie dough every now and then. But I never go out and get a bag of chips or a chocolate bar, just to eat it. I don’t buy soda to drink at home. (My mother never had soda in the house either, which I hated at the time, but guess what, mom&mdash;it worked!) Most of the junk food I eat is either at holidays, at restaurants or parties, or as gifts.</p>
<p>Before you, dear reader, get all mad that I’m being high and mighty, let me tell you what happened on Friday. I’ve never been in an office where people other than the boss give cards and gifts, but last week I walked away with quite a bit of loot&mdash;cards, earrings, picture holders, and chocolate. One of my friends gave me a very large bar of Godiva milk chocolate. It was early in the morning, but I thought a pre-breakfast square of Godiva might be the perfect appetizer. It was smooth and creamy and oh-so-delicious. I was typing, looking over proofs, and before I knew it, I’d eaten 4 squares. It wasn’t even 10 in the morning.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, I’d eaten the entire bar. I think it was something like 800 calories. I know I’ve talked shit about calories before, but I looked more out of curiosity than anything else. By the end of the day, I’d also eaten some mint-chocolate candy, some peppermint bark, and some truffles. One of my other friends asked me to go down to the cookie exchange, but by that time I was rocking a pretty severe sugar headache and didn’t think I could stomach it. </p>
<p>What happened? I thought I had self-control. I thought I wasn’t an emotional eater. But it turns out that chocolate is my kryptonite. It turns out my impulse to not buy chocolate is completely grounded in reality. I was thinking of making some sort of dessert to hand out at work, but I don’t know if that’s a good idea. If other people are anything like me, they’ve already had more than enough chocolate. However, I also don’t think people will like getting a bag of carrots with a red ribbon tied around them as a gift. How is it that chocolate is the perfect holiday gift, and anything else would just seem grinchy?</p>
<p>I decided not to be too hard on myself. ‘Tis the season, and all that&mdash;maybe the chocolate binge was just my body’s way of celebrating. After all, one of my family’s holiday traditions is still to get up early, open our stockings, and break into the chocolate long before we’ve eaten breakfast. There’s nothing quite like coffee and chocolate in front of the Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Happy holidays!</p>
