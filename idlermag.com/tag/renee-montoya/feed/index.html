										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been almost seventeen years since I came out, not yet half my life, but edging closer to it year after year. Even way back then, I felt like I was coming into myself late, twenty-one years old and in my last year of college. Today, I read about out LGBT teenagers in high school (heck, even middle school) and I go slack-jawed in awe at the courage that must take. Not that it’s a new phenomenon &#8212; my best friend today was bravely out as a high school student &#8212; but I still think back to who I was at that age and how absolutely impossible that transition would have seemed. The closet is a remarkably cold place for something so insulated from everything around you. It appears to one as a protective armor, a shield from the risk of emotional and physical attack from outside oneself. The reality is that it is more like a straightjacket, a confining garment that constricts the more you struggle against it, until you manage to perform that one magic trick that releases your bonds.</p>
<p>Up until the days, weeks, months that I came out, I could imagine only the worst. As lonely and frighteningly tenuous as that closet feels when within its walls, representing myself with what is essentially a half-lie was the only life I knew until then. No matter what you read or witness or hear about life outside the closet, you can’t truly know it until you’ve made that leap. And that is scary stuff. It’s not as if the understanding of those around you &#8212; friends, family, colleagues &#8212; is completely antithetical to the truth. But sexuality pervades the very essence of each of us. Not our sum total, or even divisible half, but a strong current that flows through every aspect of our most basic selves, making it feel as if everything is tainted when that one part is misrepresented. The build-up of that sort of pressure can be crippling, but so too can its release be equally, if not more, freeing. </p>
<p>I was lucky in many ways in regard to my coming out. I got to choose the moment; it wasn’t chosen for me. I had time to prepare. Laugh if you must, but two of my dear friends &#8212; lesbians long out of the closet themselves &#8212; helped me make note cards with possible arguments to have on hand when I spoke with my parents on the phone. I had parents who loved me, not despite my sexuality, but in concordance with it. My friends were rock solid behind me, even afterwards when I spent the goodly part of a year “catching up” on every gay-themed film, book or discussion I could wrap my arms around. The tedium of that stage in my development for those around me cannot be overstated, I think. I was blessed to be studying (and eventually working) in a field where being gay was prevalent, moving to a major metropolitan city with a large gay population, and met my husband &#8212; now of nearly 15 years &#8212; pretty early on. So, today, it’s easy for me to look back at the process as if it couldn’t have gone any other way. And while I can assuredly echo that it almost always does indeed get better, the honest truth is that every LGBT story is not the same. Some situations, sadly, only get better by degrees.</p>
<p>Renee Montoya is the perfect, albeit fictional, representation of that truth.</p>

<p>One of several lead characters in DC Comics’ 2003 series <em>Gotham Central</em>, and focus of the second story arc entitled <em>Half a Life</em>, Renee Montoya is a detective in the major crimes unit of the Gotham City Police Department. A good cop in possibly the most corrupt city in the world, Montoya stands out among her peers as incorruptible, having even survived the political nightmare of a dirty (although well-meaning) partner, now since retired. She is tough, smart and has earned the trust of both the police commissioner and the Batman himself. And she has a secret.</p>
<p>Greg Rucka, sole writer on issues 6 through 10 of the series he alternately wrote with fellow Gotham scribe Ed Brubaker, presents a tale of the closet unraveling in possibly the worst-case scenario one can imagine. Not only does Montoya get outed publicly at work by the sudden appearance of a surveillance photo pinned to the bulletin board, but a series of orchestrated events lead her to become chief suspect in a murder investigation with protection of her lover Daria as the assumed motive. That plot evolution aside, however, Rucka delivers two key scenes to Montoya’s coming out narrative that boldly reflect his commitment to telling the harsh truth behind the detective’s circumstances: the counsel from Maggie Sawyer, Montoya’s superior officer, and a confrontation with her brother Ben over a similar photo delivered to their parents.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10919" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/01/24/better-by-half/halfalife2/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg" data-orig-size="640,502" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HalfaLife2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=640&#038;h=502" alt="Maggie Sawyer" width="640" height="502" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10919" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=235 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>In Sawyer, Rucka presents someone who has come out the other side of Montoya’s travails, an out lesbian holding a significant position of power in what is historically one of the most homophobic and misogynistic professions. She is the golden ideal that Montoya, quite reasonably, cannot project her own future onto. Whether motivated by anger, fear, or most likely both, Montoya divides herself from Sawyer’s experience along lines of race and culture, positing that her boss did not come out as a Latina queer with a family tradition steeped in religious guilt and brimstone. This is a very true distinction and a bitter reality for women and men of color coming out from more traditional backgrounds and families. But there is also a sense that one can’t truly see the possibilities of an out life from inside the closet. The risks still appear to loom too heavily over the rewards, that even were Montoya to see her own future in a magic mirror, it would still remain unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Rucka’s ultimate argument on the closet, verbalized by Sawyer’s final thoughts to Montoya, is particularly astute: “It’s a one-way door, Detective. Once the closet is open, it doesn’t shut again. What you do next, you get to live with it for the rest of your life.” Whether she realizes it or not at the time, Montoya takes this advice into the next encounter with her brother, who shares their parents’ dismay over the shock of her lesbianism.</p>

<p>Ben Montoya isn’t just coming to this news, however. His sister shared her secret with him over ten years before, to poor reception. His role in enabling her closet by covering for Renee’s sexuality with their parents is an insidious, but common aspect of the type of open secret. Those family and friends who cannot immediately accept and embrace their LGBT sister or brother become implicit in the half-lie, reinforce the closet walls as it were, and are posed to suffer from its destruction as well. Ben takes it upon himself to convince his parents the photograph they received in the mail was doctored, that some freak criminal sent it as method of destroying their daughter’s credibility. As it stands, that’s pretty much what happened, but Montoya’s unwillingness to go along with his continued illusion of her heterosexuality is distinctly powerful. As they argue, notably shifting into Spanish to speak in their parents’ language of origin, Montoya expresses clearly her belief that being gay is at the core of her being, not a so-called “lifestyle choice,” and that it is in fact a positive part of herself. No matter what institutions and preconceived notions crumble around her now, she has that admission to depend on. Rucka may throw madmen and dirty cops and frame jobs at his fictional heroine, but this foundation of self-worth and respect means the reader can fight back alongside her, reflecting back her righteous indignation and pride.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10921" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2013/01/24/better-by-half/halfalife4/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg" data-orig-size="640,490" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="HalfaLife4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=640&#038;h=490" alt="aftermath" width="640" height="490" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10921" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=115 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/halfalife4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=230 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><em>Half a Life</em> ultimately owes a great deal to the artistic abilities of illustrator Michael Lark as well. Lark’s rough pencils and deep shadows reinforce not just the grit and grime of Gotham City, but also perfectly reflect the emotional tenuousness behind Montoya’s experience. She is a hard woman at her face, but builds that exterior on a shaky foundation, all the more represented by Lark’s sketched quality of line. Montoya’s range of emotion expressed through Lark’s pencils is nothing short of fantastic, as he takes the reader through every reaction the detective has &#8212; stoic or otherwise. Combined with Rucka’s trademark care for his deeply conflicted heroine, the story of Renee Montoya’s coming out stands as one of the most brutally honest, and deeply realized, reflections of the reality of LGBT life in America, even today. Times may have changed, politics are evolving, but the closet &#8212; that straightjacket of half-lies &#8212; still has a power deeply rooted in a fear and anger that won’t go away in a matter of decades. Thankfully, stories like this one have an inherent power as well, owing to the deep sense of reverence their creators have for their subject matter. As a result, for many readers gay and straight alike, it’s hard to imagine it gets better than this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best things to come out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;and there were a number of great things that came out of <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>&mdash;was the character of Renee Montoya. As a uniformed patrolwoman, Montoya starts off as the smart, straight-laced junior foil to the self-serving, corner-cutting, Batman-hating Detective Harvey Bullock. They&#8217;re both good cops in the end, but while Bullock will lie to cover his own ass and resents Batman for making him look ineffective, Montoya is honest, honorable, and knows that Batman is the same. When the series got a redesign, Montoya got a promotion to detective, and was partnered with Bullock. The comics, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t have much use for Montoya as a uniform, so DC made her a detective and partnered her with Bullock in her very first appearance. She&#8217;s put to great use in the extended &#8220;No Man&#8217;s Land&#8221; storyline, but really comes into her own when the Gotham City Police Department is given its chance to shine in the short-lived but absolutely wonderful <em>Gotham Central</em>.</p>
<p><em>Gotham Central</em> ran from 2003 to 2006, and Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka traded off storylines for the entirety of that run. While <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s fan base was (and is) avid, it was never large, which is something of a crime. The writing and art in <em>Gotham Central</em> are pitch-perfect. The characters are put-upon, overworked, and worst of all in a city like Gotham, honest. Brubaker and Rucka did a difficult thing in an extraordinary way by telling stories that seem exactly the right size in a normally hyper-colored, overexcited universe. (Check out the Teen Titans cameo in the &#8220;Dead Robin&#8221; storyline. It&#8217;s perfectly done.) If you&#8217;re the sort of person who claims to love Batman stories because of the human dimension&mdash;where Batman is just a man pushed to do incredible things at the edge of human (and not superhuman) ability&mdash;then <em>Gotham Central</em> will either give you what you never realized you had always been looking for, or it will call you out as a liar. The Batman is the superhuman presence in these pages, always a force for good, but not always on the cops&#8217; side, as they are well aware.</p>

You almost never see him in action, and even when you do, you don&#8217;t really see him so much as see the effect of what he just did.</p>
<p>On a side note, the series really do a good job of portraying that darkness as something the Batman himself <em>does</em>. There&#8217;s a scene in a later issue where a detective accidentally shoots Batman, and when he&#8217;s laying unconscious on the floor, he&#8217;s just a man in a belt and a cape. As you can see, he gets better.</p>
<p>Death is a troublesome thing in mainstream comic books, and <em>Gotham Central</em>&#8216;s treatment of death is one of the best measures of the title&#8217;s success. As much as comic books would like to tell you that they&#8217;ve grown up, mortality is usually dealt with in a manner that is at best adolescent: Major characters survive against incredible odds while minor characters and extras, in the worst hands, are used as cannon fodder&mdash;a way to titilate the reader and pretend to raise the dramatic stakes by splashing the page with day-glo red. The Batman comics are not immune from this, and a particularly awful recent example can be found in the 3-issue <em>Batman/Darkest Night</em> tie-in miniseries. Darkest Night was a DC-wide crossover event where, um, you know Green Lantern? It turns out there are &#8220;lanterns&#8221; for every color in the spectrum. Just go with it. In Darkest Night you find out there are Black Lanterns, too. Who raise the dead to kill people. And stuff. Anyway, it&#8217;s a very un-Batman, cosmic story, but they did a Batman tie-in anyway. It starts with dead Batman villains raised as Black Lanterns who attack the police department and kill a bunch of cops. Jim and Barbara Gordon get away, because they&#8217;re the only people who really matter, but dozens of nameless uniforms are slaughtered. In all honesty, it&#8217;s offensive. Not because it&#8217;s excessive violence, but because it&#8217;s stupid violence. Every uniformed officer in those pages may as well be wearing a red uniform on an old episode of <em>Star Trek</em>. They exist only to be killed, and in my mind, that&#8217;s lazy, sadistic writing. It makes me feel worse about humanity for reading it, and not in a <a target="new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels#Part_IV:_A_Voyage_to_the_Country_of_the_Houyhnhnms">Gulliver&#8217;s Travels/Houyhnhnm</a> kind of way, but in an I&#8217;m-not-sure-why-I-bother-to-read-comics-anyway kind of way.</p>

That&#039;s right. Page four.</p></div> There are several significant deaths in <em>Gotham Central</em>, and Commisioner Atkins (you read that right) is criticized at one point for having a far higher fatality rate in the Major Crimes Unit than Gordon did. (Gordon, at the time, was retired. He&#8217;s since returned to the job.) Every fatality in <em>Gotham Central</em>, however, matters. They affect the entire unit, and they&#8217;re painful to read because in every case they happen to a character who is made to feel like a person, and not just a plot point. Detective Charlie Fields is murdered by Mr. Freeze on the fourth page of the first issue&mdash;and he&#8217;s killed hard, by the way. Freeze knocks apart Fields&#8217; frozen body in front of his partner&mdash;meaning that Fields isn&#8217;t given much time to become a character on his own, but his death haunts not just the next few issues, but the rest of the series.</p>

By the time <em>Gotham Central</em> takes place, Renee Montoya has survived No Man&#8217;s Land, in which Gotham City was abandoned to anarchy after an earthquake destroyed most of the city, but she&#8217;s a character on the edge, watching good people get hurt and die around her, and ostracized by the department and her family when she&#8217;s outed by a lesbian. (By Two-Face, who still has a thing for her after No Man&#8217;s Land. Just go read it.) Everything comes to a head when Allen is murdered by a corrupt cop, Jim Corrigan, who gets away with it. Montoya, who has been less and less in control of her anger over the course of the series, bursts into Corrigan&#8217;s apartment in a drunken rage, beats his girlfriend (who is also a cop) unconscious, and puts a gun to Corrigan&#8217;s head. In itself, it&#8217;s a rather clichéd officer-on-the-edge revenge scene, but the muted artwork and the relationship between Montoya, Allen, and the reader that Brubaker and Rucka have built over the course of the previous thirty-some issues really raise the scene a level above your average mainstream comic book.</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Gotham Central</em> wasn&#8217;t perfect, and wasn&#8217;t a great fit for the DC universe, as a rather awkward Infinite Crisis tie-in issue demonstrates. Overworked detectives make for great noir/procedural stories, but not as much for cosmic/mystical/end-of-the-world stuff. (Interestingly, or painfully, both Montoya and Allen have taken big superhero turns since the end of <em>Gotham Central</em>. Montoya worked on her martial arts and meditation skills to become The Question, and Allen became the new superviolent mystical incarnation of The Spectre. Rucka still writes Montoya admirably as The Question, but Allen was such a great cop character, it&#8217;s a bit sad to see him miscast and largely ignored as The Spectre.) It is however, a great demonstration (along with work like <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/16/watching-the-detectives/">Sam and Twitch</a>), that the police noir-procedural is an amazingly underutilized genre in the comic book world. We need more of it.</p>
