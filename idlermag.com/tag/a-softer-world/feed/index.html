										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The warm weather’s back, comicomrades! You might remember me telling you once upon a winter that I read exponentially more when I can see my breath outside. That statement was stunningly accurate. Sure, I now have the option of reading a zombie novel under a tree in the commons while I get Hemingway drunk on a balmy afternoon. Don’t think I’m not taking advantage of that. But mostly I find myself gravitating towards the wooden docks next to the Charles where I spend my afternoons napping in direct sunlight like a cat. My mother calls this “a good way to end up dead” but I just call it summer. </p>
<p>There’s something about the skyscraper-reflected sun that makes the city a little more inviting, a little more homey. Squinting into the sun, the city seems like it isn’t all right angles and glass and stone. It’s a little bit softer. It’s trees, and water, and hissing geese too. </p>
<p>Speaking of a softer world, Joey Comeau and Emily Horne began <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=3" target="_blank">their weekly web comic of the same name</a> all the way back in 2003. The thing I love most about this comic is that it breaks a lot of comic rules. Each strip is comprised of three photographs taken by Horne often of friends and local haunts. Each panel is laced with <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=87" target="_blank">typewritten text that’s an equal mix of funny and tragic</a>. This comic is sardonic, and I delight in <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=65" target="_blank">its dark humor</a> more than I laugh at it. </p>
<p>Comeau, who is the author of two novels as well, also has a fun side project called <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/oqindex.php" target="_blank">Overqualified</a>. He writes cover letters for jobs he has no real interest in obtaining. My mancrush, Ryan North describes the letters thusly, &#8220;Overqualified&#8217;s cover letters are like a slap in the face, but the slap is hilarious, and you can&#8217;t stop laughing, and as soon as it&#8217;s over you want to tell all your friends about the slap. You know the kind?&#8221;</p>
<p>He also does a series of interviews called “I Am Other People”. <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/bw-display.php?id=1" target="_blank">This one</a> is my favorite, obv. </p>
<p>Horne’s weekly photo journal <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/iblamethesea/" target="_blank">i blame the sea</a> is also worth a look. Her pictures are frighteningly good at capturing mood. </p>
<p>There’s a lovely little <a href="http://xkcd.com/144/" target="_blank">parody of ASW</a> on XKCD.</p>
<p>Pro tip: don’t forget to hover over the final panel for extra text, often the best bit.</p>
<p>Is this comic for you? Or do you prefer something a little more Sunday paper-ish? Let me know! Have anything mean to say in 140 characters or less? Get at me on twitter @kate_sloan</p>
