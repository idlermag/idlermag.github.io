										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You had to know it was coming. Jimmy Fallon hosting <em>Saturday Night Live</em> the WEEK before Christmas? You had to know that the show, at some point, would feature the wacky little ditty &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas.&#8221; Many years ago the number, written by Fallon and Horatio Sanz, was premiered before the 30 Rock crowd. The original has become a classic in the realm of silly little <em>SNL</em> memories. <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/18/i-wish-it-was-christmas/">The version we linked to on this site last year</a> was NOT <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/HORATIOS-CHRISTMAS-TREAT/1185577" target="_blank">the original</a> but a different version. I remember seeing one in a warm month, or at least a spring month, clamoring for the season to arrive.  And so as I watched <em>Saturday Night Live</em> I waited and was rewarded with the 2011 version of that very first sketch. All four players were there from the original: Sanz, Fallon, Chris Kattan (looking waxy), and Tracy Morgan. They played the song, Morgan did his dance, Kattan whipped his head and almost dropped the keyboard, the audience reacted to the sketch as a classic. And it is, the song is a classic, but the version from last week was not THE version. No, there is another version, a version that I have written about before, a version that rests on top of the mountain of Christmas music.</p>
<div class="embed-hulu"><iframe width="640" height="370" src="http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=ur_W8VQ7xcVmtgY0BBJX9A" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen> </iframe></div>
<p>Ever since taking over the slot vacated by Conan O’Brien, Fallon has been creating a fun, funny, and crafty late night show. His show feels young and fun, something that always seem to brew at 12:30 at night on NBC. The irreverence is grounded by a likeability that you really sense when you see him on TV or on these commercials. The show is fun and he seems dedicated to Christmas and the season. Surf over to Hulu and keyword search Fallon and Christmas. 12 Days of Christmas Sweaters, Drunk for Christmas, etc. The man loves the season. Two year ago I happened upon the show and hear the sound of Don Pardo (or a sound alike) introducing a gift from Late Night. Out came Fallon and Horatio Sanz, in matching sweaters, and began to play the song. One minute in the song builds, the band takes off and Julian Casablancas takes over, all the elements creating an environment of pure enthusiasm and pure happy energy. The song, in reality, isn’t much lyrically, but it magically transforms into something greater in this setting. Casablancas had released a recorded version of the song in conjunction with his solo debut, this version kills his first version.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wS-k66MKgs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Last year I wrote about the song, about the way it makes me feel and the way it makes me feel whenever I hear this version with Fallon &amp; Sanz &amp; Casablancas. It combines the gentle majesty of the season with the enthusiasm of the participants and the absolute enjoyment of the crowd. As the time has passed since last year I think this song, this version, is the greatest Christmas song of all time. Why? It is the most modern, for one. Sure everyone puts out a disc of Holiday tunes for the season, these are more likely than not a collection of classics with a new spin. The majority of traditional Christmas songs were modern in the 40s and 50s, when the season was probably incredibly magical and paced well. Think of Michael Corleone shopping and finding out about his father in the first Godfather film. To me, that is the feeling of Christmas that those songs reflect. The rush that captivates and motivates us all nowadays ruins what should be a nice, reflective time of year. Some Christmas music is timeless, the <a href="https://idlermag.com/2010/12/25/1-christmas-music/">Charlie Brown Christmas LP</a> is one of the greatest complete set of Christmas music you could ever hope to have. Soft, brilliant, cheerful, devotional, yet completely engaging. That disc sounds like snow on the ground, the first snow you see, no footprints, not even from squirrels or other animals. Pure, white fields of joy under a beautiful cold blue sky.</p>
<p>The Fallon song is modern and yet it says nothing of the modern lives we lead and the crush of desire many feel at the holidays. It alerts that the season is simple and joyous and within reach whenever we need to feel simple and joyous. It is not materialistic it is excited and eager and within those emotions we too can remember those feeling and emotions.</p>
<p>I am a parent now; I have two small (in terms of age) children. I want their memories to Christmas to be driven by snow, stars, lights, and a rush of good cheer that will last until the kids are the age I find myself. The holiday season is brief, it can be rough, and events that transpire at this time of year, good or bad, will remain with you for your remaining days.  Remember that life, while bleak in points, is beautiful. Really it is. You don’t know how many more sunrises you will see, nor how many more Christmastimes. Allow yourself the chance to slow down and appreciate what makes the Holiday season magical for you now and for you when. And never forget those feelings.</p>
<p>Here is my War Against Chrismas Music mix for 2011. It ends, as last year’s ended, on Jimmy Fallon’s &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas Today.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all the time that I worked in a record store there was generally one genre of music that we never really looked forward to playing: Christmas Music. Well, that isn’t really true. There were lots of things we never looked forward to playing and rarely did, but Christmas music always felt like such a loaded genre to sift through.</p>
<p>You generally would get Christmas releases in early to mid-November, peaking around the week after Thanksgiving and then just stumbling and selling until Christmas, at which point you either slashed the prices of the music or returned it all on Boxing Day.</p>
<p>When I worked in the mall store there were a few people who liked Holiday Music (I think). Either that or they just played the music to corner the market on being annoying. I recall one fine day in early November coming out of the back room at lunch and hearing the unmistakable strains of Christmas music on the overhead. I asked my idiot assistant manager a simple question, “What the hell?” He lied in response, pinning the choice on the General Manager. I asked her the next day about this statement and she denied it. Such was the volatile nature of Holiday Music. Used to be that the music would make its way onto store stereos around Thanksgiving. I don’t know when the process became so accelerated but go into any Meijer the week of Halloween and you see the Christmas items seeping into the store. Heck, I stopped in a Walgreen’s on the way home from work and looked up in the overstock to find oodles and oodles of Christmas things. </p>
<p>At the record store we picked and chose the Christmas music, fun things to accentuate the very nature of a record store where you would shop at to experience new music. At the bookstore, the sounds would be on eight hours a day and into the night. On the two nights I worked we stopped the Christmas tunes at 6pm and we had a good five hours of quality, fun music to give everyone in the store a break from the growing tsunami of frenzied shoppers.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I actually got out of retail that I began to feel a bit of peace with Christmas and the holiday season. No longer putting up with lines, trying to find parking, and trying to keep the latest middle-of-the-road title on the shelves, Christmas returned to being a quite lovely coda to the year. Once my kids were born, it changed again. Now it seems almost too fast what with there only being three December weekends before the big day, but seeing your own children at Christmas rekindles all the warm memories of your own youth &#8212; waking up at 3am on pure adrenaline, the rush of seeing presents that simply weren’t under the tree when you went to bed. As a parent now I want my children to have those memories and associations without being swept up in the mindlessness of consumerism and general greed that feels prevalent in the season. Of course, complaining about consumerism at Christmas is about as new as Tony Bennett’s hairpiece. Watch the epic, fantastic <em>Charlie Brown Christmas Special</em>. One of the main underpinnings of the story is the way that Christmas had gotten so COMMERCIAL! Folks, those feelings were evident to the people creating that TV show FORTY-SIX YEARS AGO. </p>
<p>I wonder, with the advent of the internet and the ability to do almost everything without leaving your home or interacting with people will eradicate the yearly PTSD many retailers suffer. Smaller stores will continue to dry up and fade away while people die and are tear-gassed at big box stores hoping to saving an extra few dollars on an HDTV, dollars that they probably should either save or spend on something they need, like food or medicine.</p>
<p>I’m not here to get on a soapbox. I am here to offer an antidote to the mindless and vapid Christmas music you hear if you step outside your box at all these last weeks of the year. Last year I used today’s new-fangled technology to update the way I delivered my Christmas CD that I used to send out to friends. I put a bunch of fun Christmas Music together, spurred on by my love of the song &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas Today,&#8221; mixed it all together in GarageBand, and uploaded it to SoundCloud. I wanted to do the same thing this year.</p>
<p>Folks, it wasn’t easy finding the time to do this! But by golly I did it! Please take the time to listen to the stream, download the music, put it on your iPod for the drive or burn it to a CD. I am trying to re-upload last year’s mix (I had to tweak it slightly-the opening track was somehow flagged – I guess the family of Lawrence Welk monitors SoundCloud) for you to also dig into; there are only two songs that repeat, songs I couldn’t not put on the mix. If you want a track list email me, but I would rather hope that you downloaded the song and just sat and listened and enjoyed the journey. The way we listen to music has been on my mind lately and I want this mix, all 53 minutes of it, to be listened to like it was 46 years ago and all the distractions that we live with gone. So listen to the music, stay tuned in the coming weeks for a few discussions of my favorite Christmas music and music that you should be listening to as well.</p>
<p>And remember to slow down, take the time to enjoy the month of December. You only get so many in your lifetime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ana Holguin</strong>: In my world, you can&#8217;t go wrong with <em>Christmas Cocktails</em> by Ultra Lounge.  It&#8217;s filled with quirky and swingy Xmas favorites that I must admit I sometimes listen to during the non-yule parts of the year.  If you&#8217;ve ever thought that &#8220;Jingle Bells&#8221; needed a &#8220;cha-cha-cha&#8221; after each verse or you like the campy sound of a fay little elf voice interjecting about holly berries during &#8220;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,&#8221; then this album is for you.  Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass make the sweet baby Jesus (and me) smile.  </p>
<p>Check it out, you hep and campy cats. </p>
<p><strong>Jill Kolongowski</strong>: I won&#8217;t lie, I love me some <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNuZUCpgNeA">Michael Bublé</a>. And my mom, my sister, and I listen to the *NSYNC Christmas CD every year. I don&#8217;t even care how that sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Rosemary Van Deuren</strong>: Despite the fact that I am not Catholic, it&#8217;s still any version of “God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.” That, and Louis Armstrong&#8217;s <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQQU2ykEQqo">“Zat You, Santa Claus?”</a></p>
<p><strong>Mike Vincent</strong>: Duke Pearson’s <em>Merry Ole Soul</em> on Blue Note. While not technically my favorite it is a helluva a disc to listen to under deep blue velvet skies. The disc dates from the late 60s and begins with the slinkiest version of “Sleigh Ride” you will EVER hear, played on piano and celeste. Just a great, soulful and groovy LP to celebrate the season with. (Hint hint, the version of “Sleigh Ride” is on my Christmas Mix, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/06/the-war-against-christmas-music/">The War Against Christmas Music</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Gavin Craig</strong>: I love, love, love “The Christmas Song.” I’m known to break it out in the middle of the summer. It’s a gorgeous, quiet song co-written by one of my secret weaknesses, Mel Tormé, and perfected by Nat King Cole. (Although <a target="new" href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/the-roots-the-christmas-song-122110/1266495/">The Roots</a> did a pretty good job of it this year, too.) I recommend James Brown’s <a target="new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryKRcVqsph8">“Santa Claus, Go Straight to the Ghetto”</a> as a chaser.</p>

I mean, when one thinks about classic Christmas records, classic Christmas shows, how can you NOT think of this music? From this classic TV special, now 45 years old, we have Vince Guaraldi’s soundtrack to <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>. Everyone, everybody reading this on this site, has seen the show in question, grew up with Snoopy and the Peanuts on our TV screens and in our hearts. </p>
<p>I believe that Vince Guaraldi is the first encounter many people have with jazz music. While he is not an artist I would deem revolutionary I am a huge fan of Guaraldi, his sound and his works. I dig his work with Cal Tjader, his solo stuff, his Peanuts work, and his freakier stuff in the late 60s/early 70s. Guaraldi passed away after a club gig in 1976, leaving behind an unfinished body of work. I think he is best known for his Peanuts work but he does have more than just the sounds we are familiar with. </p>

The music is as familiar as the Little Debbie ads from the shows when I was a kid. What other Christmas music is so instantly soothing, instantly calm and peaceful? When you hear the music, you see the Peanuts, you see the snow, you see yourself as a child watching the program. Guaraldi’s style is soft, like footprints on snow, and it draws you in, makes you listen. </p>
<p>I cannot think of another complete LP of music that SOUNDS like Christmas, FEELS like Christmas, IS Christmas more than this soundtrack. Even in the uptempo moments, like &#8220;Linus &amp; Lucy&#8221; and &#8220;Skating,&#8221; the music is a celebration of the season. </p>
<p>What makes Christmas Christmas? What makes Christmas Christmas as a child? Presents, time away from school, fancy dinner and fancy breakfasts, snow, and the time spent with family. What makes Christmas Christmas as an adult? For me, now, it is the stillness of Christmas evening. The day is done, the lights are still on the tree but the mayhem and the anticipation are gone. It is quiet and it is still and it is beautiful. You can let your mind go, let your worries go, and embrace the bygone childhood feelings, feel your past as fresh as the present moment. </p>
<p>As a parent, Christmas is those things and more, as now you re-live your own memories and experiences of Christmas through the eyes of your children. Their excitement, their energy, their joy. As a parent you want to give them all that you had growing up. You want your children to feel about Christmas the way that you used to. If you are lucky, you will get to have grandchildren to experience it all again, the beauty of the cycle of things. </p>
<p>I want my children to love the holiday season, I want them to have the same kind of memories that I remember, the same experiences and emotions. During the season, on the weekend, when I play holiday music I play a few different things. But above all else I play the soundtrack to <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> by Vince Guaraldi. It is a record for the past, for the present, and for the future. It is a perfect gift in the truest sense of the word, a gift you can give every year that never goes out of style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="new" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/117205/saturday-night-live-i-wish-it-was-christmas-today">The original clip</a> is slightly hard to miss&mdash;four men dressed in matching sweaters, singing and playing a little ditty about Christmas. It was on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in the 90s. The actors were Jimmy Fallon, Horatio Sanz, Tracy Morgan, and Chris Kattan. The song was titled &#8220;I Wish It Was Christmas Today.&#8221; You sorta can’t miss it anymore during the season, what with the themed holiday recaps of <em>SNL</em>.  I think they even dropped it in the late spring once, just out of the blue. It was strange and silly and it worked.</p>
<p>In 2009 four days before Christmas I saw a clip from Jimmy Fallon’s <em>Late Night</em> show.  I find Fallon funny. I enjoy his energy and his humor. So when I heard that the sketch was <a target="new" href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/julian-casablancas-i-wish-it-was-christmas-today-122109/1187848/">“a holiday message from <em>Late Night</em>”</a> I sorta knew where it was going. At least I thought I did.</p>
<p>There was Horatio Sanz, sans a hundred pounds, singing the song with Fallon in matching red sweaters. It was a nice update. Then the something happened. The camera panned to the right and there was the lead singer of The Strokes, Julian Casablancas, singing the song! A few things happened next.</p>
<ol>
<li>I remembered how GREAT the Strokes debut was and how much I hated it when I first got it.</li>
<li>I fell head over heels in love with the song and its energy, particularly near the end when Fallon and Sanz joined Casablancas to finish the track.</li>

The sounds of the end of the song match the looks on the faces of Fallon, Sanz, and Casablancas. They’re having fun. They’re laughing. They’re happy. The joy and energy on their faces, in the music, it is the sound of youth, the sound of the happiness and excitement present in the holiday season when you are a child. I can’t tell you how often I listened to the version from the show over the next four days.</p>
<p>I kept coming back to the emotions, the happiness in the sounds and in the look (download the MP3 from the show, it is much more alive than the studio version: you hear the crowd, you hear The Roots, and you hear those smiles and the energy they bring) from the show. You almost have to see the clip to really have it burn into your brain. When Sanz and Fallon are sharing the mic with Casablancas and the way they are into the music, the moment and the performance are great. They way they ape Casblancas’ singing style is also super great. But you have to SEE the looks on their faces as their excitement in the performance really made me think of the excitement and energy that you have as a child in the lead up to Christmas and in the ultimate arrival of the day itself.</p>
<p>I remember the magic of going to bed and then waking up, stone cold awake in bed at 4am on Christmas morning. Creeping downstairs and flipping on the light switch that always triggered the tree lights. Where there were empty spaces in the morning now were full of gifts, And then you just had to wait for your parents to wake up so you could tear the wrapping off the boxes. The anticipation grew until one of your parents finally felt the energy in the house and go up to oversee the scrum. It was great, it was one of the best moments of the year.</p>
<p>I hear those emotions in the song, in the performance from the show with the whole band and with the principal writers of the song. You feel that excitement and it brings you back to being a kid, to those feeling and smiles. It is happiness in song form.  I cannot listen to the song without breaking into a smile, and when by chance the song pops up in my iTunes throughout the year it conjures the same emotions. Rather than flip right through the track I stop and listen to it. And goddamn if I don’t get excited for Christmas in doing so.</p>
