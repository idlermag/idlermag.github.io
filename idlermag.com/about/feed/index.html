					<description><![CDATA[Hello, The Idler. I&#039;m writing from The Idler, a magazine I founded 20 years ago, and have been continuously publishing since then. We just came across your &quot;Idler&quot;. I&#039;m afraid that I think you may need to change your name, or we might have a very good case for &quot;passing off&quot;. Also we&#039;ve had a few people getting the two mixed up. Looking forward to your response, Tom Hodgkinson, editor, The Idler (th@idler.co.uk)]]></description>
