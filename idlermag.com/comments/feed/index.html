					<description><![CDATA[Rock solid, and hilarious.  I dumped Ashley after getting real tired of her crap in the third one, and was pleasantly surprised when things started up with Liara (who I&#039;d really grown to love as a character starting with Shadow Broker, and who I&#039;d been lead to believe was out of play, romance wise, due to not having a previous relationship with her).  As the good Commander Bedlam stated above, Liara went a little crazy trying to bring me back to life and to keep my corpse unmolested...  Ashley was just a catty, selfish b*tch about me not calling her while I was dead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is funny! At least, Liara did her best to do something about your death while the Virmire survivors threw bitch fits hahaha. 

As for me, my bro shep is sticking with Miranda even if mine hooked up with Liara. Sorry, it was just a fling!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You described my view on sports in school to a &quot;T&quot;.   

The &quot;Alone&quot; part gets me before a race when I am just standing around without knowing anyone, and after as well (unless my wife/kids have come to cheer me on.)  But during the race, I always feel like I belong - surrounded by other people that are also running their own race.  When I ran in NY, you could say something to the fellow runners nearby, and get some sort of response. IT made me feel like I was part of something.

GREAT finish!  And gaining a memory to hang on to - that shows you ARENT alone out there running!]]></description>
