<p><em>What are some of your previous and current projects? Past or present employers?</em></p>
<p>There are not enough hours in a day for an artist! Right now I&#8217;m working at an animation studio called Oddbot Inc. I&#8217;m currently working on background design on a few different shows, but mainly I work on a super-secret Disney show. I also work on shorts for <em>Mad TV</em> for Cartoon Network. Before that, I worked as a background colorist at 6 Point Harness on a show called <em>Good Vibes</em> that just starting airing on MTV on Thursday nights, after <em>Beavis and Butt-Head</em>. I do Hallmark Ecards on the side and I&#8217;ve also done character design work for a handful of animated pilots. Just recently, I did coloring for Boom! comics for a new, yet-to-be-announced title. I&#8217;m also in gallery shows around LA with a group called Girls Drawing Girls.</p>
<p><em>Where did you go to school for art?</em></p>
<p>I graduated from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em></p>
<p>Ever since I was knee high to a grasshopper, I knew I wanted to be an artist. I remember watching <em>The Muppet Show</em> and they had a &#8220;starving artist&#8221; character once… I remember thinking, &#8220;I would like to be a starving artist when I grow up.&#8221; Well, thankfully I&#8217;m not starving, but I am an artist!</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em></p>
<p>Looking at other artwork is always inspiring. Sometimes I&#8217;ll see an artist&#8217;s work that just blows me away and inspires me to work harder on my own art. I enjoy hanging out with other artists. It seems like if I hang out with other ambitious people, it motivates me to work harder. I like going to a coffee shop and drawing people I see &#8212; cute hipster couples, old people, or ladies with big hats [laughs]. I also like to listen to really epic soundtracks while I draw, or watch movies that make me feel a certain way.</p>

<p><em>What are some of your previous and current projects? Past or present employers?</em></p>
<p>I started out self-publishing minicomics in high school and throughout university, and later started working professionally in picture books. I&#8217;ve done work for comics anthologies like Oni&#8217;s <em>Yo Gabba Gabba</em> comics and <em>Nursery Rhyme Comics</em> from First Second. I&#8217;ve contributed illustrations to genre anthologies like Thackery T. Lambshead&#8217;s <em>Cabinet of Curiosity</em>, where I was lucky enough to illustrate a story by Holly Black. I&#8217;ve just completed a book with Tor &#8212; a comic book version of Jeff Vandermeer&#8217;s novella <em>The Situation</em>. We are also collaborating on a second book together.</p>
<p>My work has been featured in <em>The Totoro Project</em> and I&#8217;ve been included in the Society of Illustrators exhibition. I&#8217;ve won the silver in the Spectrum Awards for Fantastic Art. I&#8217;ve also won the Mayor&#8217;s Award for Illustration in my home town, Halifax. At the moment my main project is <em>Maddy Kettle</em>, an all-ages series of graphic novels published by Top Shelf that I wrote and am drawing. This is my dream project. It should be out next year.  </p>
<p><em>Where did you go to school for art?</em></p>
<p>I completed a bachelor of fine arts at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. I took an interdisciplinary degree but focused on painting, drawing and art history. I think the art history impacted my work as much as any practical instruction I had there.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em> </p>
<p>I wanted to do art because I love comics and illustrated books so much. I also cared about them so much that I just couldn’t conceive of not being a part of that world. My art is driven by stories, it makes me feel connected to stories in a deep way. And I just wanted to make people and places and monsters up. I can&#8217;t overemphasize how amazing that is.</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em> </p>
<p>I have so many heroes in art, I always leave some out. But I&#8217;ll do my best: Arthur Rackham, George Herriman, Walt Kelly, A. B. Frost, Moebius, Jack Kirby, John Bauer, Paul Pope, Guy Davis, Mike Mignola, Gustave Dore, Jaimie Hernandez, R. Crumb, Art Spiegelman, William Joyce, Maurice Sendak, Jim Woodring, The Provensens, J. C. Coll, Howard Pyle, Hayao Miyazaki&#8230; I could go on and on so I&#8217;d better stop here and risk leaving out some important names.</p>

<p><em>What are some of your previous and current projects? Past or present employers?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked in the animation industry for about 14 years here in Vancouver, primarily as a background designer and character designer. I&#8217;ve worked on a lot of lesser known Canadian shows, but the ones that you may have heard of are: <em>Mission Hill</em>, which came out in 2000 on The WB. It wasn&#8217;t given a fair shake by the network, but it has a small cult following. I also did character design on <em>My Little Pony</em> season two, which has a very strong cult following.</p>
<p>In 2006 I published a comic called <em>RabbitHead</em>, which is a wordless comic that branches out into many different narratives, but eventually comes together to end where it began. Currently I&#8217;m working on a <em>Battle Kittens</em> graphic novel &#8212; a comic about warrior women who ride giant kittens into battle and have crazy sword-and-sorcery adventures. This is basically me returning to what brought me joy as a kid, watching all those monster movies and terrible <em>Conan</em> rip-offs in the eighties. I&#8217;m having a blast, and I hope that translates into the work.</p>
<p><em>Did you go to school for art, or are you self-taught?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to art school or animation school, however, I am loathe to use the term &#8220;self-taught.&#8221; I feel that you learn the most by hanging out with artists who are more talented than yourself. You also have to never stop learning, and keep your mind open to new things. There&#8217;s a great Ukrainian saying: “What good is the world being so wide, if your heart is so narrow?”</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em></p>
<p>When I was six years old I drew a picture of “Animals From Mars,” and on the opposite side of the paper, I drew “Plants From Mars.” From then on I was hooked; the scope of the human imagination is limitless. As a pathologically shy kid, this allowed me to create a world I felt comfortable in, and as I grew into my confidence I had the skill set to make it into a living, although a meager one. Besides, if I wasn&#8217;t doing this I&#8217;d probably be washing dishes somewhere.</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em></p>
<p>My husband. We don&#8217;t draw the same subject matter, but he draws right next to me and I can always trust his opinion. There is also my &#8220;mews&#8221; Orson Kittyman, who sits on my lap at the art desk and helps me out with <em>Battle Kitten</em> anatomy.</p>

<p><em>What are some of your projects? What is your studio space like?</em></p>
<p>I do my illustration work from home. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have a little studio space that I sometimes refer to as “the batcave”. It&#8217;s got all my favorite stuff in it (supplies, books, computer) and it&#8217;s right beside the kitchen, which means I am just steps away from the coffeemaker at all times. I also work part time as a Junior Designer in an office with some really cool people.</p>
<p>As far as illustration projects go, I just finished a book jacket for a Canadian small press publisher, and right now I&#8217;m working on storyboards for a music video. I like to keep myself busy working on my portfolio or sketching or studying something. I&#8217;m trying to work on some portfolio pieces that do not have tentacles or fetuses floating in glow-y jars.</p>
<p><em>Are you going to school for art?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m just finishing up a Bachelor of Design degree at OCADU [Ontario College of Art and Design] in the Illustration stream. I feel as if I owe a great deal of my education to people outside of university as well. A lot of my personal learning has come from encouraging and talented people who have been kind enough to dole out advice or kick me in the pants, whatever the occasion calls for.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue a career in art?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been really into drawing, but I think that must be true of every kid with a pencil. I just kept at it; my science teacher in high school used to confiscate my sketchbook at the door. I remember those classes as being very, very long.</p>
<p>I was actually kind of apprehensive about going into art because it&#8217;s not exactly the most practical career path. For a year I waffled between art and doing something “more sensible.” (For some reason I thought this more-sensible thing was history &#8212; I have no idea where I got that idea!) Thankfully friends and family intervened, which is great because I would be one miserable historian. The idea of not having gone into art seems ridiculous now.</p>
<p><em>Who or what inspires you artistically?</em></p>
<p>So many things! Blank sketchbooks, peeking in other people&#8217;s sketchbooks, fresh bottles of ink, drawings of any kind, full bookshelves, those tiny drawers stuffed with pen nibs at the art store; a long list of illustrators, comic artists, painters and other crafty people.</p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>As a performer I&#8217;m known for my dark, out of the box acts—messy, outrageous, sometimes borderline offensive. I do have my moments of pretty, feminine acts, but on the whole I think I&#8217;m more known for pushing boundaries, and if I happen to come across as sexy while doing it, so much the better. My modeling tends to contain that same aesthetic, and I would say my sarcastic, black-humor-tinged outlook on life as well.</p>
<p>I have been seen in short films for Nokia, been featured on <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, have danced with Natalie Portman in <em>Black Swan</em>, posed nude for foreign magazine fashion spreads, worn priceless designer couture with Q Models in fashion videos, walked the runway for impeccable gothic designers, shot fetish films in Newcastle, graced the stages of legendary NYC nightclubs, and so much more! It&#8217;s been a wild ride!  </p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m always thinking up new acts for my regular burlesque residency with Original Cyn Burlesque at the Lucky 13 Saloon in Park Slope, Brooklyn. I&#8217;m also looking forward to getting my foot in the door with new shows and venues &#8212; right now I&#8217;m excited to be performing with Geek Girl Productions again, for Edification for the first time, and of course with my favorite underground NYC party <em>TRASH!</em> at Webster Hall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been doing a lot of television and film work recently. I just did featured background work on a new show for HBO called <em>Spring/Fall</em> starring Tea Leoni and Sigourney Weaver. You will also be able to catch me on upcoming episodes of <em>Law &amp; Order: CI</em>, <em>How To Make It In America</em>, <em>Men In Black 3</em> and many more to come.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a dancer and performer?</em></p>
<p>I grew up dancing. My mother had been a ballerina and when I was old enough to walk, she decided it was time for me to start ballet lessons. I continued with ballet until well into college, when I took a break to focus on my BFA in Media Arts/Animation at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. A few years after moving to New York I started modeling, and a DJ gave me my first real “start” as a burlesque performer at the infamous <em>Rated X: The Panty Party</em> at Luke &amp; Leroy’s. I didn&#8217;t really know that I was doing &#8220;burlesque&#8221; per se &#8212; I had choreographed a dance number and incorporated some strip elements into it. After that I started gogo dancing at various downtown parties for fun, and then in 2008 I was approached by the amazing Fem Appeal who runs <em>Kitty Nights Burlesque</em> every Sunday at Bar on A. She asked me to debut at her show, and from there the ball started rolling. I was very lucky in the sense that people have been willing to give me a shot sight-unseen, or by word of mouth. That&#8217;s not always easy to do in this town!</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>“Go big or go home.”<br />
“A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.”<br />
“If not now, when?”</p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I moved to New York as a theatrical performer in 2010, having done shows such as <em>bare</em>, <em>The Wild Party</em>, <em>A Few Good Men</em>, <em>Side Show</em>, <em>La Cage aux Folles</em>, and more. I&#8217;ve also done drag for almost four years now, and have always had a passion for makeup &#8212; I even went to school in full face every day of my sophomore year in high school in conservative Cave Creek, Arizona. I&#8217;m 6’5” and both of my parents were models, so I got pushed into that as soon as I was old enough. I&#8217;m known for my strange personality, and for being kind while being dressed like a bitch.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>Right now I’m working on a few parties that I will be starting, and I&#8217;ve been altering and making a lot of my clothes. I have some offers for shows (theatre) lately that I&#8217;m juggling and can&#8217;t really talk about yet. I&#8217;m looking to start working on music more since that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m the most versed in, and I&#8217;m pulling a lot of inspiration from my significant other.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a performer and model?</em></p>
<p>I became everything that I am, and that I do, because it gives you a key to open minds and challenge people&#8217;s thoughts and beliefs. I like to make people question themselves because if we all plateau intellectually, we might as well be dead. Individuality is not only attainable by some, you just need to tell society to piss off and live life for yourself.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in hate, and I believe that “regret is like drinking a glass of poison and waiting for someone else to die.” I believe that if you want something you should go for it. And I believe that if you need to put down others to get to where you want to be, and if you keep hidden agendas and secrets, you don&#8217;t deserve to achieve your dreams. Live, love, and keep your chin up.</p>

<p><em>Nadia Aboulhosn’s self-styled photos have been featured on fashion blogs and sites all around the web, including teenvogue.com. Says Nadia:</em></p>
<p>I am known for pushing limits and breaking barriers. I am known for doing what I want despite society&#8217;s views and beliefs.</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em> </p>
<p>My creative energy is focused on my fashion blog and my future career in fashion. I am constantly in competition with myself to outdo what I previously did before. I am currently in the process of building a portfolio to apply for fashion school in New York. I am looking to start my own shoe line, style people other than myself, and possibly start modeling. All in all, my desire is to eventually become a fashion icon and inspire people everywhere. I just got done with a photo-shoot for <em>Seventeen Magazine</em> that will be out in November 2011. They used me to model some of their clothes. </p>
<p><em>What made you decide to pursue fashion?</em></p>
<p>Designing and styling always came easy to me. Fashion is the only thing that excites me, so making it my career is only right. Through art, people are able to express themselves whether it&#8217;s  drawing, painting, or music. Fashion, to me, is another form of art. It is a way for me to express myself. </p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em> </p>
<p>Never compromise. Settling is never an option. Dictate your own life while thinking intelligently rather than emotionally. </p>

<p><em>What are you known for?</em></p>
<p>I am known for bending the gender lines in a way no one has done before. My extreme ways of expressing myself are quite delicious to some. Some call me the &#8220;Master of Masquerade&#8221;, and I like that. I&#8217;ve been on the cover of <em>Quest Magazine</em> (Wisconsin&#8217;s LGBT Mag) and just recently took an artistic risk in my newest short movie <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqEwQCCA6Q0" target="_blank">&#8220;Angel&#8217;s Ashes,&#8221;</a> which was just released on YouTube. But most of my success has come from the internet, winning photo contests and such&#8230; so far&#8230;</p>
<p><em>What are you working on right now?</em></p>
<p>I aspire to take over the world. To act, to move people. Continue with photography and creating photos that twist people&#8217;s minds into endless questions. I aspire to be on the cover of national magazines and to help people find the courage to run with fire, come into their own and be truly comfortable with who they are.</p>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a model, performer and artist?</em></p>
<p>I always felt like I wanted to make the world a better place. I was always the weird, awkward one that everyone was leery about. I scratched the walls of my small town until my nails bled. Now I&#8217;m exploring every possible facet of life and entertainment, and I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s your life philosophy?</em></p>
<p>Eat the brains of life! [laughs] Or:<br />
&#8220;Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well.&#8221; &#8211;Josh Billings<br />
&#8220;Be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love, work, play and to look up at the stars.&#8221; &#8211;Henry Van Dyke</p>
