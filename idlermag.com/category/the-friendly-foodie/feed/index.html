										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While summer reading lists tend to put one in mind of trashy paperbacks stashed away in canvas bags for beach reading, not many of us will spend the entire summer in a folding chair. Thus, a good set of summer reading suggestions will include options suitable for a variety of situations and pursuits. Whether you&#8217;re soaking up summer rays, trapped inside by a sudden summer storm, or looking for a different kind of summer getaway, this list should have you covered. (You&#8217;re welcome.)</p>
<p><strong>For those hot summer days:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10109" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/heat/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg" data-orig-size="271,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="heat" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=203" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=271" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&#038;h=150" alt="Heat" title="heat" width="101" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10109" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=101&amp;h=150 101w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/heat.jpg?w=202&amp;h=298 202w" sizes="(max-width: 101px) 100vw, 101px" /> Other than <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/18/quit-cooking-start-reading/">Jill&#8217;s Kolongowski&#8217;s recommendation</a> of Julia Child&#8217;s <em>My Life in Paris</em> (which is both an amazing book and actually about a lot more than just Child&#8217;s life in Paris), the most enjoyable food book you can add to your summer reading list is Bill Buford&#8217;s <em><strong>Heat: An Amateur&#8217;s Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany</strong></em>. Formerly Fiction Editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>, Buford leaves his magazine job to learn about cooking in Mario Batali&#8217;s restaurant Babbo shortly before the release of <em>The Babbo Cookbook</em>. It&#8217;s a time when the restaurant is both preparing for fresh critical scrutiny and tweaking the menu to move beyond the soon-to-be-published set of recipes. No one in the kitchen has the time or patience for a rank amateur in their midst, and Buford has to make the most of it &#8212; which he does with humor, humility, and aplomb. <em>Heat</em> is a welcome counterpoint for those of us put off a bit by the overwhelming bravado of Anthony Bourdain&#8217;s <em>Kitchen Confidential</em>, and things just get better when Buford heads off to Italy to study with some of Batali&#8217;s mentors.</p>
<p><strong>For those stormy summer nights:</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s actually some really amazing stuff in even the biggest mainstream comic books right now. Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo&#8217;s work on <em>Batman</em> is unbelievable (and in a different venue, I&#8217;d have written that word in all-caps AND bold AND italics), Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang&#8217;s work on <em>Wonder Woman</em> is everything the New 52 promised to do, a magnificent re-imagining of a classic (but too-often underutilized) character &#8212; the character designs alone are worth cover price &#8212; and Gail Simone&#8217;s <em>Batgirl</em> is a remarkable and psychologically gripping take on Barbara Gordon that manages to preserve most of what was wonderful about Simone&#8217;s time writing the character as Oracle. (This is high praise coming from me. I was really disappointed that <a href="http://gavinjcraig.com/2011/08/21/goodbye-batgirl-hello-batgirl/" target="_blank">DC was abandoning</a> <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2009/08/quick-break.html" target="_blank">Stephanie Brown</a> in order to bring back the Barbara Gordon Batgirl, although, in fairness, I might just be the only person in the world who feels that way.)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10116" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/batman-and-son/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg" data-orig-size="419,644" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Batman-and-Son" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=195" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=419" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&#038;h=150" alt="Batman and Son" title="Batman-and-Son" width="97" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10116" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=97&amp;h=150 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/batman-and-son.jpg?w=194&amp;h=298 194w" sizes="(max-width: 97px) 100vw, 97px" /> But, assuming that you might not be the sort of person who visits a comic shop every month, let me recommend Grant Morrison&#8217;s current run on <em>Batman, Inc.</em> as the culmination of a story he&#8217;s been telling since 2006. Morrison is a writer whose work actually often reads better when it&#8217;s been collected into a trade volume where the reader can pick up all the visual and story clues he weaves together from month to month (which can often seem a bit obscure when you&#8217;re only getting 20ish pages at a time, with 30 or more days between installments). Morrison&#8217;s saga starts with <em><strong>Batman and Son</strong></em> (with a jaw-dropping first issue where Batman fights ninja man-bats in a Roy-Lichtenstein-inspired pop art exhibition), and continues in <em><strong>The Black Glove</strong></em> (with art by the no-less-than-absolutely-brilliant J. H. Williams III), <strong>Batman R.I.P.</strong>, <em><strong>Batman &amp; Robin Vol. 1: Batman Reborn</strong></em> (where Dick Grayson steps into the cape and cowl), <em><strong>Vol. 2: Batman vs. Robin</strong></em>, <em><strong>Vol. 3: Batman &amp; Robin Must Die</strong></em>, and finally, the pre-New 52 <strong><em>Batman, Incorporated</em></strong>. (Completists will include <em>Final Crisis</em> and <em>The Return of Bruce Wayne</em>, but you can get away without reading those two. Just know that Bruce Wayne dies, sort of, and then comes back.)</p>
<p>Like many &#8220;difficult&#8221; writers, the trick to reading Morrison is to just keep going. With Morrison in particular, you&#8217;ll get totally lost if you worry about making sense of everything. I think the big secret is that Morrison spends a lot less time worrying about whether he makes sense than building and keeping up a sort of narrative cadence and momentum. When you really get into him, you don&#8217;t so much read as excavate, digging up all the things that you didn&#8217;t realize were there at first, and finding yourself pulled into the most neglected and maligned corners of a character&#8217;s history, suddenly shown (well, skillfully retconned) to have been the most interesting and important thing all along.</p>
<p>But, having said that, you don&#8217;t need to know anything about Grant Morrison or even Batman to pick up <em>Batman and Son</em>. (Although, good luck putting it down once you&#8217;ve started.)</p>
<p><strong>For getting away from it all:</strong></p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10122" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/06/27/stories-all-summer-long/journeycollectorsed/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg" data-orig-size="277,350" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="journeycollectorsed" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=237" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=277" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=118&#038;h=150" alt="Journey Collector&#039;s Edition" title="journeycollectorsed" width="118" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-10122" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=118&amp;h=150 118w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/journeycollectorsed.jpg?w=236&amp;h=298 236w" sizes="(max-width: 118px) 100vw, 118px" /> Being the sort of person who tends to talk about narrative video games, I&#8217;m going to recommend a game rather than a book on games. (If you&#8217;re looking for a fun AND smart book on video games, there&#8217;s always Tom Bissell&#8217;s <strong><em>Extra Lives</em></strong>, which <a href="http://wordwright.blogspot.com/2010/06/diary-of-casual-gamer-2-confessions-and.html" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>, or you can do what I do and crib from <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/" target="_blank">The Brainy Gamer</a>&#8216;s bookshelf.)</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t played it yet, go download Thatgamecompany&#8217;s <em><strong><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/05/18/three-meditations-on-journey/">Journey</a></strong></em> right now. There&#8217;s a collector&#8217;s edition disc coming out at the end of August (which will also include <em>Flower</em> and <em>Flow</em>), but don&#8217;t wait. Hell, download it now AND buy the disc in August. Anything to encourage people to make more games like this.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, <em>Journey</em> will only be available for the Playstation 3, so my apologies if you don&#8217;t own one. For everyone else, we can count <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect-3/Extended_Cut_Endings">the new <em>Mass Effect 3</em> endings</a> as narrative, right? Just for the summer?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I almost don&#8217;t eat a sandwich without a nice layer of mayo between the bread and whatever is in the middle. (Unless what&#8217;s in the middle is peanut butter, because that would be gross.) Now mayonnaise is terribly easy to buy in the store, and I&#8217;m even pretty satisfied with my two major choices&#8211;Hellmann&#8217;s and Kraft. (You didn&#8217;t think I meant Miracle Whip, did you? Miracle Whip doesn&#8217;t even <em>call</em> itself mayonnaise, so I&#8217;m going to take them at their word and insist that we&#8217;re talking about two different things.)</p>
<p>So why would I want to make my own mayonnaise? Well, I do have a column to write, and Alton Brown insists that homemade mayo is head and shoulders above the store-bought stuff. Mr. Brown has never steered me wrong, and I love anything that lets me do a bit of magic in the kitchen. With visions of conjuring white, fluffy goodness from an egg yolk, some oil, and some vinegar, I printed out <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/mayonnaise-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Alton Brown&#8217;s recipe</a> and prepared my whisk.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="9192" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/19/beefy-forearms-and-emulsions/mayostart/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg" data-orig-size="4000,3000" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M341 Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1332104614&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;160&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.05&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="mayostart" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="before the whisking begins" title="mayostart" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9192" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=960 1280w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/mayostart.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>I started, as directed, with an egg yolk, salt, sugar, and dry mustard. <a href="http://youtu.be/BOymdsYMoqQ" target="_blank">Gordon Ramsay says</a> that seasoning the mayonnaise at the beginning destroys the egg yolks, but that kind of sounded to me like exactly what I was about to do with the whisk anyway. According to Brown, whisking the yolk, seasonings, and a little bit of vinegar gives you a head start on your emulsion &#8212; that is, the magic process of coating the oil droplets with lipids from the egg yolk in order for the whole thing to mix together on a permanent basis. Also, using the phrase &#8220;head start&#8221; made it a pretty easy sell.</p>
<p>So I said &#8220;Screw you, Gordon Ramsay,&#8221; and started whisking. That is, I said it in my head. I would never, ever say screw you to Gordon Ramsay out loud. Not even when he&#8217;s probably on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The key, apparently, to keeping the emulsion going once it&#8217;s started is to add the oil a little at a time, and to keep whisking no matter what. Some people will tell you that you can use a food processor instead of whisking. Ignore these people. Virtue and beefy forearms lie ahead for those who do their own whisking. Virtue, beefy forearms, and mayonnaise. Well, the people who use food processors get mayonnaise too, as do people who just go to the store, so maybe we should focus on the beefy forearms. Like Popeye. Did I mention virtue?</p>
<p>Anyway, after adding about half the oil, I added the rest of the vinegar, and had something that looked a bit like this:</p>

<p>At this point, supposedly, you can relax a bit, and add the oil a little faster. Personally, I kept it slow, and even set the oil aside from time to time to make sure everything was fully incorporated. Also to switch whisking arms. Before too long, I had a bowl full of this stuff:</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t put it on a sandwich yet, but the first taste was pretty good. Even better, I used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, so the wife expects it to be a touch mellower next time. Either way, it&#8217;s definitely mayo and not Miracle Whip, so I&#8217;m very, very happy.</p>
<p>Will I use a food processor next time? Maybe. Will there be a next time? Definitely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me be clear that the title of this article is meant to be an exaggeration &#8212; by car, I live a very comfortable two or three minutes from a well-stocked grocery store with plenty of produce and a somewhat self-involved organic food section. (I&#8217;m down with organic foods, but this place is set up kind of weird, with all the organic stuff by itself between the paper towels and the frozen foods. If you&#8217;re looking for something organic, it won&#8217;t be by the regular item, it&#8217;ll be off by itself in the organic section. Me, I tend to just avoid it.)</p>
<p>No, my own private food desert is my apartment.</p>
<p>Like many people in this fine country of ours, I&#8217;m a bit heavier than I ought to be. And, again, without overstating the problem, things of late had been getting worse than better, so there are fewer impulse foods around the house. There is a strategically limited supply of dark chocolate, and cream cheese is strictly rationed. Red meat, already scarce, is gone almost entirely. There&#8217;s a solid supply of chicken breasts and ground turkey, but potato and corn chips are <em>persona non grata</em>.</p>
<p>None of these trends are entirely new to the Craig kitchen, but they have definitely become more pronounced.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing, although not, apparently, good enough. Because, you see, while my waistline has stopped expanding, after a good start, it&#8217;s stopped shrinking as well.</p>
<p>Before I lose you entirely, let me reaffirm that under no circumstances will this become a diet column. I have no interest in trading tips, debating the perfect diet, or passing any judgment on individual foods other than whether or not it makes me happy to put them in my mouth. (I do have such opinions, but like politics and religion, it is often best to keep such things to one&#8217;s self.) In the long run, my goal is to stay the same weight, and one not terribly far from the one I am now.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not there yet.</p>
<p>So what do I do? Well, largely, I&#8217;m going to put a bit more time in at the gym, and I&#8217;m going to work to reconcile myself to being just a little hungry all the time until I get there. And that&#8217;s the complaint of which I&#8217;m most ashamed. Too many people deal with real hunger, and I, emphatically, do not equate my position with theirs. I am, however, finding that I do not deal well with that constant gnawing urge, and I&#8217;m looking forward to being done with it.</p>
<p>But there are two cheap tricks that I&#8217;m going to try in order to (hopefully) give me that additional push.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m going to cut liquid calories to an absolute bare minimum. For someone who doesn&#8217;t drink water, well, almost ever, I actually do better than you might expect on this front. Most of what I drink on a day-to-day basis is aspartame sweetened powdered tea or lemonade. (Yeah, it&#8217;s Crystal Light. And yeah, it&#8217;s pink lemonade. What?) However, that Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA has 209 calories per 12 ounces. (The 90 Minute IPA has 294.) And my beer snobbery means that light beers are out of the question, so yeah, beer is kind of out until I reach my goal.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not motivation, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p>And second, carrots. They&#8217;re low in calories, and even better, they&#8217;re incredibly satisfying to chew. And for me, at least, when I&#8217;m hungry, that&#8217;s a huge help. Chewing carrots (or sugar-free gum) at the end of the meal has been a great trick to let my stomach catch up with my mouth. It gives my chompers something to do, and it takes my mind off food.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p>
<p>But the sooner I get there, the sooner I get to have interesting food in my house again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The panini is the worst thing to happen to the sandwich since the invention of fat-free mayonnaise. Too often it&#8217;s a way to disguise a lousy sandwich on cheap bread by adding a couple of grill lines. The fillings are still lousy, the cheese barely melted, and the bread tastes flat and stale. A squished, lukewarm sandwich. Ugh.</p>
<p>There are plenty of fine ways to make a hot sandwich. After Thanksgiving every year, I make hot turkey sandwiches by warming leftover turkey and gravy together and pouring the result over toast. I&#8217;ll eat this for lunch every day until the gravy runs out (and sometimes for breakfast, especially if there&#8217;s a bit of stuffing too.) I&#8217;m also a fan of the oven-toasted sandwich, I don&#8217;t even care who does it. I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this column if hot sandwiches weren&#8217;t the best sandwiches and the panini weren&#8217;t just a dry, tepid loogie on the face of hot sandwiches everywhere. </p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another option, one that really makes the panini suffer by comparison, and that&#8217;s the grilled sandwich. The dry, compressed panini is really just a pale imitation of the rich, buttery, glorious, tuna melt, or grilled cheese. Or even better, and as I&#8217;ve found, a bit more unusual, my personal favorite, the grilled peanut butter sandwich.</p>
<p>The only other person I&#8217;ve ever heard of who ate grilled peanut butter sandwiches regularly was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter,_banana_and_bacon_sandwich" target="_blank">Elvis Presley</a>, and he liked to load his sandwiches down with bananas and maybe bacon. I hate bananas, so I&#8217;m going to stick with the basics. This is a really simple recipe, so I&#8217;m not going to bother with amounts. (In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t bother with the recipe at all if I didn&#8217;t always get such uncomprehending looks when I try to tell people about what seems like it should be a self-explanatory sandwich.)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="8898" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/02/20/up-in-my-grill/100_1063/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/100_1063.jpg" data-orig-size="640,359" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M341 Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1329486485&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;80&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033332999769841&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="100_1063" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/100_1063.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/100_1063.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/100_1063.jpg?w=640&#038;h=359" alt="" title="100_1063" width="640" height="359" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8898" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/100_1063.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/100_1063.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/100_1063.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Spread peanut butter (preferably crunchy) between two slices of bread, butter one side of the sandwich and place on a hot griddle. Carefully butter the unbuttered side of the sandwich. Grill until the bottom is golden (3-5 minutes), then flip and grill the other side (maybe 2 minutes). Serve immediately.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m trying to recreate my childhood, I&#8217;ll cut the sandwich into fingers, but just about any presentation will do (or none at all &#8212; bachelors feel free to consume immediately over the stove). And give up on the panini. Seriously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of breakfast. I eat it early, I eat it late, and just about once a week, I even eat it for dinner. Thus I was happy to discover a few weeks ago that one of my favorite breakfast chains, <a href="http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/" target="_blank">The Original Pancake House</a>, has a restaurant just down the road.</p>
<p>Unlike your normal griddle-based breakfast joint, The Original Pancake House is known for its liberal use of the oven. Their baked omelets are unlike any omelete I&#8217;ve ever had (in a good way &#8212; they claim to mix in a bit of pancake batter), and their signature puffy Dutch Baby pancakes are front and center on the web site.</p>
<p>And the big secret about that glorious, puffy, golden brown, marvel of a pancake? It&#8217;s incredibly easy to make, and a handy dish to have in your repertoire when you&#8217;re looking to impress someone, maybe over breakfast.</p>
<p>The whole thing is really nothing less than culinary magic, where with very little effort, you can produce something spectacular.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend (and normally use) <a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/puffy-oven-pancake-with-berry-topping/fa1070e1-1aed-438d-87c7-5366ff90fff3#?st=6&amp;term=oven pancake&amp;ps=9&amp;pi=9&amp;fv=AND(HasGridViewImage%3ATrue)" target="_blank">Betty Crocker&#8217;s straightforward version</a>, but perhaps in a backhanded attempt to prove that simpler is better, I gave <a href="http://www.cookscountry.com/recipes/Dutch-Baby/23038/?incode=M00KSCR00" target="_blank">the Cook&#8217;s Country version</a> a try.</p>
<p>The oven pancake is basically a big, eggy popover. (For more on popover theory, see Alton Brown parts <a href="http://youtu.be/NjtcyUb4S5M" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/UmKcegIBtkU" target="_blank">2</a>) And like a popover, the one thing that you absolutely must do without fail is to heat the pan before you pour in the batter. The batter itself is fairly forgiving &#8212; you can be technical like Cook&#8217;s Country or basic like Betty without <em>too</em> much difference in the final pancake, but if the pan isn&#8217;t hot, you won&#8217;t get a rise.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much to add to the recipes before you pour the batter in the pan. Unlike a soufflé (or in my house, waffles), you don&#8217;t need to worry about preserving the beaten egg whites. Unlike normal pancakes, you don&#8217;t need to worry about losing the rise from the batter sitting too long once the baking powder meets moisture. Betty will tell you not to overbeat, but you have a pretty big margin of error.</p>

<p>Cook&#8217;s Country called for a 450º oven to Betty&#8217;s 400º, and vegetable oil to grease the pan instead of melted butter. I used canola oil, and it was surprisingly finicky. By the time my batter was ready, the oil had apparently spent more time than it wanted above its smoke point and turned green. It didn&#8217;t affect the flavor at all (the oil doesn&#8217;t really incorporate into the batter), but it didn&#8217;t exactly look appetizing.</p>
<p>Happily, that didn&#8217;t get in the way of the magic happening.</p>

<p>If making a good impression is your goal, make sure that everyone is in the kitchen. The pancake will deflate slightly as it cools, so the big dramatic moment will be when you pull it out of the oven.</p>
<p>Sprinkle some lemon juice and powdered sugar, and brush up on waffles for next time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love delivery. Not only does it speak to my eternal laziness, but it makes me feel connected. It&#8217;s like getting mail, only faster and thus better. And so often, the things that one can get delivered are the great guilty pleasures &#8212; pizza, cupcakes, inexpensive Chinese food.</p>
<p>And now, apparently, Burger King.</p>
<p>Shortly after I moved into my new apartment, a flier showed up on my door announcing that I was part of Burger King&#8217;s new delivery area. (There are currently 7 stores in Maryland and 3 in Virginia offering delivery, with 6 more in Virginia starting up by the end of the month.) Normally, if a fast food hamburger isn&#8217;t enough to drag me out to a drive-through, then delivery doesn&#8217;t sound much better, but the flier promised new packaging to keep everything crisp and hot. This past summer, Alexis Madrigal wrote about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/07/the-3-big-advances-in-the-technology-of-the-pizza-box/242116/" target="_blank">the technology involved in pizza delivery packaging</a>, so my curiosity was piqued enough to give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>12:08p.m.</strong></p>
<p>I put in the order. The preferred ordering system is online, although there is a phone number. The minimum order in my area is $10, which isn&#8217;t terribly convenient for one person. I order a Whopper combo (fries and a 20 ounce bottled soda), say yes to the suggested add-on chocolate pie, and add a side order of onion rings. This brings my total to $9.96, an aggravating four cents short of the minimum order. I add a one dollar side salad to push my total to $10.96. I knew when I took on this experiment that I was going to be ordering a lot of food, but this is still a bit intimidating.</p>
<p>And then, adding to the frustration of $9.96 not meeting the minimum order, the additional charges get added on. There&#8217;s sales tax, and a two dollar delivery charge &#8212; which the order form takes pains to clarify &#8220;is not a tip.&#8221; My official total comes to $13.51. I decide to give a two dollar tip, bringing my grand total to $15.51.</p>
<p><strong>12:38p.m.</strong></p>
<p>While the email I receive to confirm my order doesn&#8217;t promise a specific delivery time, the flier indicated that Burger King shoots for a 30-minute delivery. They don&#8217;t make it. I&#8217;m not really upset about this, but I am really hungry, and I&#8217;m trying not to snack on the food that&#8217;s already in my apartment. Which is probably better than the mountain of food that&#8217;s on its way. 30 minutes is probably too fast to expect for normal delivery, but it may also be too long to have to think about whether this experiment is really a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>12:41p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The food arrives, and it&#8217;s actually close enough to the 30-minute window that I should probably credit it as on time. (I actually have to interrupt my notes on whether the experiment was a good idea in order to get the door.) Somewhere along the way, a phantom 32 cents was added on to my order, but I chalk it up to an error in calculating the tax (two days later, I still can&#8217;t figure out how either $13.51 or $13.83 makes sense), and don&#8217;t make a big deal of it.</p>
<p>My order takes up two full bags, and this is what it looks like spread out on the table.</p>

<p>The innovative packaging, as you can see below, is largely a re-engineered McDLT box, where the lettuce and half the bun are kept separate from the hot portion of the burger. It folds up cleverly, but otherwise, it just kind of makes me want a McDLT. (McDonald&#8217;s brings back the McRib all the time. Why not the McDLT?)</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="8609" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/01/23/a-supposedly-successful-experiment-that-ill-never-repeat/100_1040/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_1040.jpg" data-orig-size="640,480" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M341 Digital Camera&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1326895721&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.3&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="100_1040" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_1040.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_1040.jpg?w=640" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_1040.jpg?w=640&#038;h=480" alt="the meal" title="100_1040" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8609" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_1040.jpg 640w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_1040.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/100_1040.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>After putting everything together, I&#8217;m almost ready to conclude that Burger King should use the separated box for all its sandwiches. The assembled burger is easily the most visually appealing I&#8217;ve ever gotten from a fast food restaurant. Burger King in particular seems to try to see exactly how flat they can make your food before giving it to you.</p>
<p>But how does it taste?</p>
<p>In all truth, it tastes like every other Whopper I&#8217;ve ever had, which means that the packaging works well. The fries have congealed a bit in their box, but once separated, they&#8217;re surprisingly crisp. The onion rings are exactly the taste and texture of the ones I&#8217;ve had straight from the deep-fryer.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s hard to escape the fact, especially confronted by this pile of deep fried food, that none of it is very good. I ate less than a third of what I ordered, and the chocolate pie was the only part that was actually kind of good.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the funny thing, at least for me, about fast food. If I&#8217;m away from it for a while, it has an almost magnetic appeal, but more and more when I actually start eating it I have to confront the fact that it doesn&#8217;t even taste good. I made <a href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/amys-delicious-turkey-burgers/" target="_blank">turkey burgers</a> for dinner that night, and I&#8217;m really not the sort of person to get excited about turkey burgers, but they were far, far better than my lunch was.</p>
<p>So the final verdict: If you&#8217;re a Burger King fan, you&#8217;ll be impressed with their delivery. They do an amazing job of maintaining quality from the restaurant to your door, and if you&#8217;ve ever eaten fast food french fries that are more than ten minutes old, you know that&#8217;s quite a feat. I, on the other hand, have had enough Burger King to last me a long, long time. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My enthusiasm is usually a good sign that something is on the way out, and in fact by the time you read this, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History will have started to take down its display of Julia Child&#8217;s kitchen. Originally planned for an 18-month exhibition in 2002, and tucked away out of sight in the museum&#8217;s basement, Child&#8217;s kitchen has been so popular that it&#8217;s been on display for nearly ten years. Even now, elements from the kitchen will be incorporated into a new display <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/julia-childs-kitchen-to-close-temporarily-on-sunday/2012/01/03/gIQA84PdcP_blog.html" target="_blank">&#8220;about big changes in what we ate in the last half of the 20th century.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I am excited about the new exhibit, but I&#8217;m not immune to the lure of a pilgrimage, and I wanted to see the kitchen in it&#8217;s original(ish) state before it gets repurposed.</p>

<p>Julia Child is one of my cooking heroes. She&#8217;s a food icon in the U.S., but unlike most contemporary celebrity chefs, she was never a restauranteur. For all practical purposes, she didn&#8217;t even start cooking until her mid-30s &#8212; and you really should read her accounts of her disastrous first efforts in her memoir <em>My Life in France</em>. Child was, however, a force of nature. When she devoted herself to a task, she was unstoppable. Through hard work and force of will, she graduated from France&#8217;s Le Cordon Bleu cooking school &#8212; you should also read about Child&#8217;s struggles with the school&#8217;s headmistress, Madame Brassart &#8212; and almost immediately set to the task which would in one fashion or another consume the rest of her life, teaching beginners how to start cooking well.</p>
<p>This devotion to beginners and Child&#8217;s irrepressible <em>joie de vivre</em> are the secrets of her enduring popularity. <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> is famously written &#8220;for the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children&#8217;s meals, the parent-chauffeur-den-mother syndrome, or anything else which might interfere with the enjoyment of producing something good to eat.&#8221; Even that &#8220;on occasion&#8221; is essential. Child and her co-authors aren&#8217;t writing for people who <em>never</em> have to worry about money, waistlines, or children. Instead, Child is imagining the audience for her book as people like herself &#8212; people who are perhaps not (yet) accomplished cooks, but who want to eat and cook just a little better than they otherwise might, and just need a supportive teacher to help them get there.</p>
<p>And Child was born to be that teacher, telling us that it was okay if things didn&#8217;t quite go right, that it&#8217;s good to stretch ourselves in the kitchen. It&#8217;s not as hard as it seems, and, even better, it&#8217;s worth the time and the effort you put in. And perhaps best of all, we shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of using too much butter.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more than a little evidence of Child&#8217;s impact even today. Her <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> is still on bookstore shelves next to the <em>Joy of Cooking</em> that Child so revered. (There are two &#8212; count &#8217;em, two &#8212; copies of <em>Joy</em> on the shelf in Child&#8217;s kitchen.)</p>

<p>There are two volumes of Child&#8217;s <em>The French Chef</em> available on DVD, and you can still catch reruns of Child&#8217;s later series <em>Baking with Julia</em> on PBS. The latter was filmed in the 1990s, and Child is mostly an observer and kitchen assistant to the featured cooks. She&#8217;s much older than her <em>French Chef</em> days, with a pronounced stoop in her back, but the voice and personality are still there, and you can still catch her dipping her fingers in the chocolate if you pay attention.</p>
<p>There was of course, far more to Child than her cooking. If you dig a little deeper you&#8217;ll find that she was struggling with alcoholism during her <em>French Chef</em> days, and it&#8217;s tempting to attribute her <em>bonhomie</em>, as well as that famous dropped chicken, to the drinking. But it&#8217;s never really as simple as that. When Child escaped the bottle, she was still the same Julia, and it&#8217;s possible to watch her lifetime behind the camera and never dream that her struggles were so severe.</p>

Hidden among all the pots, pans, and knives in Julia&#8217;s kitchen is Child&#8217;s government-issue &#8220;emergency signal mirror,&#8221; a relic of her World War II service in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services" target="_blank">Office of Strategic Services</a> in China. There is debate even today over whether Child herself or the man she met during her service and eventually married were ever spies themselves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible to eat well, to cook well, something really special every once in a while, and to be totally, completely awesome even if you never, ever let anyone know.</p>
<p>Child kept her OSS signal mirror in the junk drawer in her kitchen until the day she donated the room to the Smithsonian. As of yesterday, at least, they were still together.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why Child always had a smile on her face. And if Julia was imagining writing for an audience like herself, then maybe we can imagine ourselves to be a little more like her as well. Maybe getting to know the kitchen a little better can mean being a little bit more awesome too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My grandfather wouldn&#8217;t eat garlic. While my family has produced a number of picky eaters, I don&#8217;t normally think of my grandfather as having been one of them. I don&#8217;t remember running into many things that he wouldn&#8217;t eat, although that may be been one of the privileges of eating mostly at one&#8217;s own house and being choosy about where one eats out. I ate a lot of good food with my grandfather, but no garlic.</p>
<p>This is a stark contrast to the food I eat with my wife&#8217;s Italian family. When I was a child, pasta sauce was something that came from a jar and was poured over ground beef and noodles. My wife makes her own sauce, sometimes with fresh tomatoes and sometimes with canned, but always, always with fresh garlic.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fine line between being a picky eater and being a food snob. I&#8217;d like to suggest that in the right hands garlic can sometimes bridge the two. </p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to do garlic bread. Even a quick search turns up recipes from <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Rachel Ray</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/zesty-roasted-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Paula Deen</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Ina Garten</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/herbed-garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Tyler Florence</a>, <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/guy-fieri/garlic-bread-recipe/index.html" target="_blank">Guy Fieri</a>, <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-2734" target="_blank">Bon Appétit</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Bread-106583" target="_blank">Gourmet</a></em>. A lot of these involve quantities of cheese, herbs, tomatoes, or some combination of the above, and they&#8217;re all fine.</p>
<p>But as much as I love fresh garlic &#8212; and I do &#8212; garlic powder makes a perfectly good garlic bread. Take any loaf of unsliced crusty bread and cut it in half. Spread butter over both halves. Sprinkle garlic powder on the butter &#8212; a little goes a long way &#8212; and toast both halves under the broiler just until it starts to brown. Share if necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not anything that I would eaten in my grandfather&#8217;s house, but I think of him every time I eat it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that I have kids, I spend more time than I would like thinking about packages to put under a tree. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m perfectly fond of stuff, and I&#8217;ve rediscovered a great deal of the fun of Christmas morning now that I get to see the excitement in my daughters&#8217; eyes. Still, most of my family is fortunate enough to have most of the stuff that we really need, so buying gifts can sometimes feel like an exercise in attempting to demonstrate thoughtfulness through the purchase of a useless object.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, food is where I really enjoy the holidays. There&#8217;s none of the pressure, and while opening presents may be my daughters&#8217; favorite part of the day, for me sitting down to eat with family is what the holidays are all about.</p>

<p>Attentive readers already know that <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/28/cranberries-before-you-know-it/">I love cranberries</a>, and while cranberry soda might not be the most foodie-friendly use of the fruit (hell, I&#8217;m not sure it really involves actual cranberries), but the first appearance of those red bottles just before Thanksgiving is more welcome than fake fir trees, sentimental music, and artificial snow. Hell, I&#8217;m drinking the stuff right now.</td>

<td><strong>2) Chocolate orange</strong></p>
<p>This is actually a British Christmas tradition, and beyond the fact that orange flavor and dark chocolate go surprisingly well together, a proper chocolate orange even gives you a irresistible bit of ritual. Before you unwrap the chocolate orange, you give it a sharp tap on a hard surface. When you open the orange you&#8217;ll find it broken into individual segments. Break out the champagne and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_cracker" target="_blank">Christmas crackers</a> and you&#8217;ll be ready to wish everyone a happy Christmas. Cheers!</td>

<td><strong>3) Christmas cookies</strong></p>
<p>Every year, my family holds what we call a cookie party. We get together and mix big batches of cookie dough, most of which is frozen in batches, ready to be baked. None of the cookies are complex &#8212; my favorite, shortbread, is the simplest of all &#8212; and since there&#8217;s (almost) no cooking, we can all be in the kitchen together without having to fight over the oven. It&#8217;s one of my favorite holiday traditions, and now that I live so far from everyone, I miss it terribly. I&#8217;ve had to console myself with these dark chocolate stars from Trader Joe&#8217;s. They&#8217;re shortbread covered in dark chocolate. I&#8217;m on my second box.

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; you say, &#8220;that&#8217;s it?&#8221; Yeah, that&#8217;s it. I honestly devote more food energy to Thanksgiving than now. I&#8217;m just looking forward to seeing all the people I&#8217;ve missed. Whatever they put in front of me will be the best food I&#8217;ve eaten all year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everywhere I go, I&#8217;m finding macaroni and cheese. Family restaurants like Max and Erma&#8217;s have added it to the menu. For a while, Burger King was offering Kraft mac &amp; cheese as an option in its kid&#8217;s meals. It&#8217;s become the go-to when my wife and I take the girls out to dinner, and it&#8217;s my older daughter&#8217;s all-time favorite food. Everybody&#8217;s happy, everybody wins, right?</p>
<p>This past weekend, the family and I had dinner with my sister-in-law and her husband at a &#8220;bar and grille&#8221; in Madison, New Jersey. Any place the adds an &#8220;e&#8221; to the word grill clearly takes its menu seriously, and one of the entrees was an &#8220;adult&#8221; mac and cheese. While &#8220;a luscious aged cheddar and American cheese blend, baked with a scallion breadcrumb crust and a touch of brandy&#8221; sounded tempting to me, my daughter &#8212; the m&amp;c expert &#8212; doesn&#8217;t like her mac and cheese to be too fussy. Mushrooms? Onions? A Ritz cracker crust? She&#8217;s out. The kid&#8217;s menu included &#8220;mac&#8217;n cheese&#8221; without any additional description, so we crossed our fingers when both the girls ordered it.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, when the kid&#8217;s &#8220;mac&#8217;n cheese&#8221; arrived, it was a bunch of elbow noodles swimming in Velveeta. The girls wouldn&#8217;t touch it. I was severely annoyed and just a little proud. (They ended up sharing my burger, which looked like it was good.)</p>
<p>So last night, to make up for it, we made a batch of our own mac and cheese at home. It&#8217;s pretty basic, but worth sharing as an alternative to the standard boxed version. Not that the salty, tangy, powdered cheese substitute variety doesn&#8217;t have its appeal, but just a little bit of effort can give you noodles swimming in a gorgeous, golden, sharp cheddar sauce.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
<li>1 cup milk</li>
<li>2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by melting the butter over low heat, and then add the flour. It&#8217;ll start off looking like this:</p>

<p>And as the magic happens, it&#8217;ll start looking like this:</p>

<p>As many of you know, what you&#8217;re doing is making a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux" target="_blank">roux</a>, where the flour particles form an emulsion in the butter fat and act as the base for your eventual cheese sauce. As anyone who has watched a Velveeta commercial knows, while cheddar tastes awesome, when it melts it gets kind of oily. Thus the sauce rather than just melting a block of cheddar over the noodles. (Which would actually taste fine, if you don&#8217;t mind the oil.)</p>
<p>(If you want to stretch a little bit, you can continue to heat the roux a minute or two before moving on to the next step. It&#8217;ll toast the flour, giving you a darker roux and a slightly nutty flavor to your final mac and cheese.)</p>
<p>Add the milk and salt to your roux, and melt the cheese into the sauce, adding a little at a time. Pro tip: those packages of pre-shredded cheese you can find in the supermarket are generally exactly two cups (8 ounces). If you&#8217;re like me and pull the package straight from the freezer, you can raise the heat to medium. Stir until all the cheese has melted. It&#8217;ll be a golden pot of cheesy awesomeness to make Velveeta curl up with envy, and it&#8217;ll look something like this:</p>

<p>Boil the noodles while you&#8217;re making the sauce. When both are done, stir together in an oven-safe casserole dish. When we&#8217;re in a hurry, we&#8217;ll serve the mac and cheese just like this.</p>

<p>The girls have never complained, but I&#8217;m much happier when we throw the mixture into a 350-degree oven for 20-25 minutes, and it comes out looking something like this:</p>

<p>Most of the &#8220;adult&#8221; restaurant mac and cheeses you&#8217;ll find will have some sort of a breadcrumb crust, which is wonderful, but even just the cheese sauce by itself will give you a nice, tasty crust after baking. (If you prefer a creamier mac and cheese, you can double the milk in the sauce to two cups.)</p>
<p>And now you&#8217;re ready to experiment! Mushrooms! Jalepeños! More cheese! But even without all that, you have a wonderful, rich, cheesy macaroni and cheese. Even better, so long as you&#8217;re not feeding a group, you&#8217;ll have leftovers waiting for you any time need a warm plate of comfort food.</p>
