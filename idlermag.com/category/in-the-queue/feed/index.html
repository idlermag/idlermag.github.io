										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“If you like <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> then you’ll love <em>Outcasts</em>!” At least that’s what the producers of <em>Outcasts</em> are probably hoping you’ll say. Unfortunately at only 8 episodes long, <em>Outcasts</em> is a mere shadow of the show it aspires to be.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Plot</strong><br />
Plots are hard! I know, it’s okay. The home planet of humans has been destroyed but a few scattered ships make it out alive and try to settle on a world they don’t know much about all the while a nefarious force is tracking them down. So, is this the plot of seasons 2/3 of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> or the plot of <em>Outcasts</em>. It’s both, silly!</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Character</strong><br />
<em>BSG</em>’s Gaius Baltar is the unique combination of scientist, traitorous political officer, and religious leader. <em>Outcasts</em>’ Julius Berger is the unique combination of scientist, traitorous political officer, and religious leader.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Actor</strong><br />
Star power! <em>BSG</em> fan favorite Jamie Bamber appears briefly in <em>Outcasts</em>. He’s on the show long enough to get people who like <em>BSG</em> to start watching <em>Outcasts</em>, but not so long that casual viewers would start to pick up on how similar <em>Outcasts</em> is to <em>BSG</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Plot Element</strong><br />
Cylons: We created them and they turned on us so we tried to kill them and now they’re pseudo-humans who would like to see us destroyed, but we may have to try to live together. Advanced Cultivars: We created these pseudo-humans who turned on us after we tried to kill them and who would like to see us destroyed, but we may have to try to live together.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Twists</strong><br />
One of the pseudo humans is amongst us unbeknownst to even her! Gaius/Julius is a traitor! There may be something more mystical going on that we can or want to understand!</p>
<p><em>Outcasts</em> is a decent show especially if you’re jonesing for something more with <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> off the air. Just set your expectations appropriately.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Farscape</em> was why my spouse and I bought a TiVo. It was a show we discovered not long after we got married and that we were soon watching faithfully. But we discovered after our babe was born in 2001 that live television watching wasn&#8217;t compatible with baby minding, and we rediscovered the unreliabilty of taping shows on a VCR. We couldn&#8217;t do without Moya and her crew, and so we bought a first-generation TiVo, along with a lifetime subscription to its services. We&#8217;ve been proselytizing the joys of TiVo ever since (we&#8217;ve upgraded to a recent model and have hacked that to increase its memory). But <em>Farscape</em> had disappeared from our lives for a while. It went off the air, and although I&#8217;m pretty sure we own it on DVD, I don&#8217;t tend to remember to watch my DVDs. But with its appearance on Netflix Instant, nothing can come between me and Ka D&#8217;Argo again.</p>
<p>What blew me away when we first started watching the series was how far removed it was from the imaginative and visual universe of <em>Star Trek</em>. There&#8217;s no crew of brethren searching for scientific knowledge, no utterly foreign aliens, no discrete episodes with uplifting morals. It&#8217;s a sprawling soap opera in which the crew of the living spaceship constantly argue and jostle for dominance and reveal secrets and longings and shifting alliances. The villains &#8212; and, oh the evil chasing Creighton and Aeryn and the others is evil indeed &#8212; are also complex and sometimes allies in the moment, even while never to be trusted.</p>
<p>The best way in, if you haven&#8217;t seen the show before, is to start at the beginning. But be forewarned: the series was cancelled abruptly, so what should have been a cliffhanger was, for many years, the ending. You&#8217;ll be able to watch beyond the fourth series to the 2004 <em>The Peacekeeper Wars</em> mini-series that tried to wrap things up more equitably. But that sudden ending was the biggest betrayal I&#8217;ve come across in television. I&#8217;m still bitter about it. I&#8217;m actually a bit reluctant to return to the show with the full force of love I felt for it before. I&#8217;ll dip my toes in once and a while, but I can&#8217;t immerse myself anymore. You should, though. Your heart won&#8217;t get broken, I promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volumes have been written about Jean Dujardin and his performance in <em>The Artist</em> (2011), and for good reason &#8212; the guy is hilarious. <em>The Artist</em> was not Dujardin’s first comedy, nor was it his first film with director Michel Hazanavicius or co-star Bérénice Bejo.</p>
<p>The three worked together on the spy-film satire, <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/176926" target="_blank">OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies</a> (2006). It is a hilarious romp, and worth checking out. Do not let the French subtitles scare you away either. I wish more folks would get over their dislike of subtitles, as they are missing out on many great films. </p>
<p>A quick subtitle-related anecdote: I used to work for a big video store, and when <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> came out, all of the store’s VHS copies were subtitled. The store was flooded with people wanting to exchange the tapes, because they &#8220;didn’t want to read.&#8221; It got to the point where I had to preface each transaction with &#8220;This film is subtitled.&#8221; More often than not, folks would change their mind and get a different film (as a result, copies of <em>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</em> were in high demand). </p>
<p>Back to <em>Cairo, Nest of Spies</em> &#8212; like <em>The Artist</em>, it is a period piece. The film takes place in 1950s Cairo, and it is, in a word, gorgeous. The sets, the costumes, the locations, and the cinematography are top notch. The film not only echoes the costumes and locations of 1960s spy films, but also the cinematography and production. Film buffs take note.</p>

Coty? No?</p></div> If you loved Dujardin’s suave, mugging-for-the-camera charm in <em>The Artist</em>, there is plenty more here. Dujardin plays the French version of James Bond, or perhaps more accurately, Maxwell Smart. The humor comes from Dujardin’s character (Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, aka OSS 117) being clueless about everything around him. Most of the humor relies on &#8220;did he just say that?&#8221; gags, as Dujardin makes brash observations about the culture in Cairo. </p>
<p>The humor differs from the over-the-top style of <em>Naked Gun</em> or <em>Austin Powers</em>, but there are thematic similarities. OSS 117 is a fool, but he loves his country (he tries to tip people with photos of President René Coty), and he is the definition of confidence. Dujardin also tries to &#8220;out-Connery&#8221; Sean Connery when it comes to charming the ladies as a spy, which generates plenty of hilarity. The film also features many running jokes (like the Coty photos) and sight gags.</p>
<p>Sure, Dujardin’s OSS 117 is a brash, arrogant fool, but you cannot help but be charmed and amused. Dujardin oozes charm and confidence, and makes OSS 117 quite the lovable character (and there aren’t any jokes about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Powers:_Goldmember" target="_blank">farting submarines</a>). </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don’t know what to watch on Netflix. Sometimes I’ve just had enough of watching <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a></em> and <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/02/23/downstairs-at-downton-abbey/">Upstairs, Downstairs</a></em> and even <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/">Paul Newman</a>. Sometimes I just want to see something I haven’t seen before.</p>
<p>So what do I do? I turn to Netflix to see what it can suggest for me. It magically delivers movies right to my television. Surely it can peer into my brain and have its algorithms magically intuit what I want to discover.</p>
<p>Here’s what Netflix is telling me:</p>
<p>Since I recently watched <em>Doctor Who</em>, I will want to watch <em>My Little Pony</em>. No, no I won’t. But when I tweeted my surprise at that recommendation (which then got retweeted a few times) I learned that maybe yes, yes I do. According to one tweeter, <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/">there’s a high correlation between <em>Who</em> fans and bronies</a>. In fact, that tweeter hunted down a number of other folks tweeting about My Little Pony to explain to them that <em>Doctor Who</em> fans and <em>Star Trek</em> fans and <em>My Little Pony</em> fans are all one and the same. I’m not sure any of us were convinced.</p>
<p>Because I’ve watched Buster Keaton’s <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> (a compilation of Keaton shorts, all of which are thoroughly enjoyable, especially if you’re watching them with a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old) and <em>Gosford Park</em> (which is way way way better than <em>Downton Abbey</em> in that it is smarter, funnier, subtler, and heartbreakinger), Netflix has paired them to create a category called “Crime Movies.” So based on my interest in <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> and <em>Gosford Park</em>, I will be interested in the top-rated <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> (too too true, though it’s a crime movie only in the way that the other two are also not crime movies), the most popular <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em> (definitely a crime movie, but while I do love Harry Bosch, I’m not a big Mickey Haller fan), as well as the <em>Dragon Tattoo</em> trilogy (yes! horrible violence and is-it-or-isn’t-it misogyny!), <em>Chinatown</em> (fill in your own joke here), <em>Kick-Ass</em> (I actually don’t know this one, and the description of it is not convincing me I want to), and <em>Return of the Pink Panther</em> (because that’s a crime movie, yessirreebob). Okay then, maybe not.</p>
<p>Further down the screen, Netflix recognizes that I have an interest in “witty crime movies” (true enough) based on the fact that I’ve watched &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> and <em>Gosford Park</em>. This time, it suggests <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em>, <em>The Way of the Gun</em>, <em>How to Steal a Million</em>, <em>Witness for the Prosecution</em>, <em>Evil under the Sun</em>, and <em>A Night in Casablanca</em>. Apparently witty crime movies are things made long ago, unless they involve Ryan Phillippe and Benicio del Toro, because sexy modern movie stars definitely equally witty intellect.</p>
<p>But if you combine <em>Sherlock Jr</em> with <em>Office Space</em>, Netflix will generate “comedies.” Some of these suggestions are spot-on. I’ve seen them and I’ve loved them. <em>Dr Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog </em>will never get stale, never ever ever. Of course, I own the DVD, with all the extras, but it’s nice to know that I can watch it at work and on my phone and, well, ahem. Back to the subject at hand. <em>The Big Lebowski</em> was plenty enjoyable when I saw it (though, unlike many of the movie’s fans, I only saw it the once). <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>? Is that really a comedy? I do enjoy it, though, as long as I skip over the offensive racist parts. <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> is, naturally, sheer genius (even if I can’t figure out how to get an umlaut over my n). Based on that track record, I think Netflix is right that I might enjoy <em>The Trip</em>, a mockumentary from Michael Winterbottom with Steve Coogan and Rob Bryden as a couple of actors on a foodie road trip across England. That’s right up my alley. And I have friends who love Louis C.K., so I’m willing to say that his <em>Hilarious</em> probably isn’t a far-fetched recommendation either, even though my gut tells me I won’t like it. But <em>TEDTalks: Smart Laughs</em>? Are you fucking kidding me? And <em>Daniel Tosh: Completely Serious</em>? You’d have to kill me to get me to watch those.</p>
<p>At least I’ll get to watch <em>The Trip</em> first.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always firmly believed that, deep down, people like to be corrected when they are so wrong about something that it borders on embarrassment. Mind you, I say “people,” and not “friends,” for reasons that should be immediately self-evident. However, as one of the newest contributors to <em>The Idler</em>, I feel I have a responsibility to inform my colleagues that they are all unquestionably, irredeemably and thoroughly incorrect in the running debate about just who is the best Doctor.</p>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">Matt Smith</a> is a very fine Doctor, better than I had expected in fact. <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Christopher Eccleston</a>, <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/04/04/kindness-and-fury/">David Tennant</a>, fantastic both. But the one that stands head and shoulders (and quite a mop of hair) above the other Doctors is none of these, or for that matter, any Who had come before. The best Doctor, running across our television screens on a mission through time and space, is, in fact, Dr. Mrs. The Doctor: the often mysterious, ever sharp-witted, frequently dangerous, and classically stunning River Song, played by actress Alex Kingston.</p>

<p>Point of clarification: I’m a relatively new recruit to <em>Doctor Who</em> fandom. My husband’s giggling like a child over every Dalek appearance has generally fallen on deaf ears (I wish!) for years. I have been in the room for more episodes than I can claim to have watched, ever finding a comic book to read, web to surf or cookbook to page through while some madman slides across the TV screen with a vibrating piece of hardware that I barely know how to use in non-vibrating form. But all that disinterest evaporated the moment River Song walked into the library and bid hello to her sweetie for the first (and last) time.</p>
<p>I can’t say precisely what it was that made me toss <em>Bridge for Dummies</em> aside and take notice those first moments, but I have a pretty good idea. Here was a confident, beautiful woman who clearly knew more about the Doctor than the Doctor knew about her. That alone placed her far above in my mind any traditional companion, each of whom is clearly present firstly for the purpose of exposition and viewer projection. And then it was revealed: River Song is no run-of-the-mill companion. She knew the Doctor’s name. THE DOCTOR’S NAME. You don’t come across that information by chance. No, this lady was important. She’d been through many adventures with the Doctor (most of which we’ve presumably already seen now &#8212; drat) and beamed happily that they were all ahead of him at this point in his timeline. And then she died. Good Lord. I was hooked.</p>

<p>Two people living their lives in reverse, never traveling through time in the same order, is so beautifully romantic it should be a movie (or at least an acclaimed novel). So, yes, we’ve seen this trope before in both iterations of <em>The Time Traveler’s Wife</em>, but never with so much agency for that titled character. Dr. Song (as in life, I must acknowledge the title, for it is not easily acquired) doesn’t just sit around waiting for the next time her bow-tied beau will show up to whisk her away. Sure, she may need a quick rescue from time-to-time, but carving coordinates into the side of an ancient mountain with her trademark salutation “Hello, Sweetie!” isn’t exactly fainting at a villain’s moustache twirl. She’s ballsy enough to shoot herself out an airlock with no oxygen and trusts that the Doctor will have gotten her directions. The greater trust, I’d argue, isn’t in the Doctor, though. It’s in her own ingenuity and ability to know exactly what levers to pull in the Doctor’s personality and history to get the maximum desired results.</p>
<p>And that’s nothing compared to the gun-slinging. This scene from the Sixth Series’ &#8220;Day of the Moon&#8221; encapsulates everything about why Dr. Song is close to my heart. She flirts from a position of intellectual strength (and gets the often timid Doctor to flirt along with equal glee) and she polishes off a room of enemies like a 50-year veteran of Laser Tag University.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVVQ0u--mYo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>So, yeah, River Song is brilliant, but why is she a better Doctor than the Doctor?</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><strong>She’s redeemed.</strong> My understanding of the Doctor is that he’s always been a do-gooder. Traveling through time, righting wrongs, helping civilizations evolve &#8212; that’s the Doctor’s schtick. Dr. Song’s past is not that cut-and-dried. I’d rather not get into the minutia of River’s origins in case you, dear reader, are one of the lucky few to not yet have enjoyed them firsthand, but let’s just say they’re murky. She’s in prison for murdering “The best man I’ve ever known” (now who could that be?) but she clearly cares about saving lives and defending the innocent. She’s compassionate and good with all kinds of reasons to not have become either one.</li>
<li><strong>She’s smarter.</strong> Dr. Song almost immediately exhibits more ingenuity in how to do the things the Doctor does, from uses for the sonic screwdriver to how to appropriately pilot the TARDIS. Yes, one could say she has the advantage of hindsight from her point in the Doctor’s history, but let’s be honest about that. The Doctor has lived, at any given point of the current narrative, around one thousand years. You’d think he’d know to take the brakes off when landing by now. That noise doesn’t sound good to me, and I can barely pump my own gasoline.</li>
<li><strong>She’s got more to lose. </strong>Dr. Song can’t regenerate (you’ll see) and doesn’t live forever. She’s human, but still has to emotionally deal with the loss and pain that comes along with being a time-traveler. She’ll have to say goodbye to the people she loves just like the Doctor, and frankly, it seems to me she loves them just a little bit more. Despite all that, she jumps into adventure like every day is her last. No matter what the Doctor claims, he’s pretty sure he’ll be around tomorrow. Ultimately, River knows, someday she won’t. Life doesn’t end well for River, but she puts it all on the line anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dr. Song knows what her worst day is, and it isn’t the day she dies. Neither me, as that was the day I first came across clever, ruthless, amazing River and fell in love with <em>Doctor Who</em>. No, her heartbreaking moment will be “when I&#8217;ll look into that man&#8217;s eyes &#8212; my Doctor &#8212; and he won&#8217;t have the faintest idea who I am.”  Mine is when <em>my</em> Doctor, Dr. Song, disappears forever, the last tale of a finite life told, and I have to go back to my reading material when the TARDIS buzzes in the background.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nearly fifty years and eleven actors, we have some idea of what makes the Doctor: <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">&#8220;He’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s a bit distant, and <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/28/a-tale-of-two-doctors/">&#8220;he has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely.&#8221;</a> He&#8217;s dangerous &#8212; when the Doctor is around, people die &#8212; but he&#8217;s irresistible, and, in the David Tennant incarnation at least, he&#8217;s a walking broken heart. He&#8217;s the one who has to make all the impossible choices and save the world, even though he may not be able to save you.</p>
<p>After Christopher Eccleston spent a year breathing new life into the Doctor Who francise, and sacrificed himself to save pop singer Billie Piper (a.k.a. Rose Tyler) from a case of terminal omnipotence, David Tennant stepped into the Doctor&#8217;s trainers and travelling coat for a four-year, three-season run as the Tenth and best Doctor. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s run actually starts off a bit slowly, not entirely hitting its stride until halfway through #10&#8217;s second year (and second companion).</p>
<p>In &#8220;Human Nature/The Family of Blood,&#8221; the Doctor and companion Martha Jones hide out in early twentieth century England from a family of intergalactic hunters. In order to keep the family from tracking them, the Doctor has to alter his physiology to become human, and hide his memories and identity in a pocket watch. (It&#8217;s <em>Doctor Who</em>. Believe it or not, it all makes sense in the episode. Mostly.) The family is relentless, but they&#8217;re short-lived, so if the Doctor and Martha can hide for a few months, they&#8217;ll be safe.</p>
<p>While they&#8217;re hiding, however, the Doctor has no idea that he&#8217;s been anything other than John Smith, schoolteacher at a boys&#8217; boarding school. To make things worse, he&#8217;s fallen in love with the school nurse, Joan Redfern. In order to become the Doctor again, John Smith has to give up his existence. In effect, he has to die for the Doctor to live, and since the Family of Blood has found him, the Doctor has to live in order to be able to save the people John Smith loves.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4wziEiE3Vc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>It is, interestingly, a story in which the Doctor is almost entirely absent, even when David Tennant is onscreen, and when the Doctor returns, his return is terrible.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SC0NuBaliLs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>After this episode, David Tennant&#8217;s Doctor is constantly on the edge of not being the Doctor anymore. After defeating fellow Time Lord The Master (the brilliant, manic John Simm) in &#8220;The Last of the Time Lords,&#8221; the Doctor nearly gives up his itinerant existence in order to care for (and imprison) the one being who could actually be a full and equal companion. In &#8220;The Waters of Mars,&#8221; the Doctor abandons Time Lord constraints and attempts to intervene in a fixed point in history &#8212; avert a tragedy without which the human race might never have set out to explore the universe. In &#8220;Journey&#8217;s End,&#8221; the Doctor prevents a full regeneration (and the same sort of identity death that John Smith faced) by shunting his regeneration energy into the creation of a full second self, who isn&#8217;t a Time Lord, isn&#8217;t immortal, and, not coincidentally, end up getting to lead exactly the sort of life the Doctor wishes that he could have, sharing a single lifetime with an equal partner, instead of an eternal series of temporary companions.</p>
<p>Whatever he does, the Tenth Doctor is never able to escape the costs of his actions, and indeed, his very existence. He is always apologizing to the people he cannot save, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQkFNVhppXo" target="_blank">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In some sense, judging whether the Tenth Doctor is the best Doctor isn&#8217;t an entirely fair competition, since, rather unusually for a new Doctor, Tennant inherits a lot of the strongest elements of Eccleston&#8217;s (and Russell T. Davies&#8217;) modern <em>Doctor Who</em> relaunch. <em>Doctor Who</em> isn&#8217;t really known for continuity &#8212; in fact, each regeneration is normally treated as an entirely fresh start &#8212; but the Tenth Doctor benefits from the show&#8217;s willingness to reach back to previous companions and previous Doctors, and to continue to build on the relationships the Tenth Doctor creates. Companions depart and return &#8212; Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Donna Noble, and even Sarah Jane Smith, who traveled with the Third and Fourth Doctors. Every departure is heartbreaking. Every return comes at a cost, and leads both to triumph and further heartbreak.</p>
<p>For all that, in all honesty, I&#8217;m a bit surprised to not find myself fonder of Matt Smith&#8217;s Eleventh Doctor. The current head writer, Steven Moffat is responsible for many of the very best episodes of both the Ninth and Tenth Doctors&#8217; runs, including &#8220;The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances,&#8221; the Christopher Eccleston episodes that finally made me a full-on rabid fan of the Doctor, and my absolute favorite episode, &#8220;Blink,&#8221; which really should totally devastate my argument since David Tennant is barely in it.</p>
<p>But the Eleventh Doctor&#8217;s episodes are somehow shallower. The Tenth Doctor&#8217;s playfulness with language (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3GMkWfpj4s" target="_blank">&#8220;Allons-y! I should say allons-y more often. Allons-y. Look sharp, Rose Tyler, allons-y!&#8221;</a>) is transformed into a penchant for silly hats. (I&#8217;ll give you the fez, Matt Smith, but the stetson/bow tie combination is not cool.) Even worse, Moffat somehow steps on his own best ideas. The Weeping Angels, so frightening and unique in &#8220;Blink,&#8221; (&#8220;The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death.&#8221;) are transformed into brutes that just snap your neck.</p>
<p>I will look forward to the new season, especially if it gives Matt Smith a chance to figure out who his Doctor is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/21/showbiz/tv/doctor-who-new-companion-ew/index.html" target="_blank">without Amy Pond</a>. No Doctor who hasn&#8217;t lost a companion is <em>really</em> the Doctor, and that, ultimately, is why the Tenth Doctor has to stand above Nine and Eleven.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like most nerdy lads in the early ‘90s, I was a fan of <em>Star Trek</em>. While I enjoyed the original series, I had more exposure to <em><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/169810" target="_blank">Next Generation</a></em> and <em><a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/172000" target="_blank">Deep Space Nine</a></em>. So, it warmed my heart to see that both of these series are on Netflix Watch Instant. As I began re-watching <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, however, memories about how much I enjoyed the show came flooding back.</p>
<p>Prior to Netflix, I probably had not watched an episode of <em>Deep Space Nine</em> in at least ten years. (Someone had to be showing reruns somewhere, right?) When I first really got into <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>Next Generation</em> was on its way out, and <em>Deep Space Nine</em> was starting. As a result, I probably watched more <em>Deep Space Nine</em> episodes in my youth &#8212; I watched <em>Voyager</em> too, at first, but I stopped when they killed off <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Hogan" target="_blank">Ensign Hogan</a> (dang land eels!).</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I like <em>Next Generation</em> plenty. But, there is something about <em>Deep Space Nine</em> I enjoy much more. Maybe it is the tension on the station, or how the characters treat each other. I love the scenes between Odo and Quark, with their game of wits and double-talk. But, there is also the touch of respect, to some extent, between the pair.</p>

<p>I enjoy the &#8220;gray&#8221; aspect of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>’s characters &#8212; those who aren’t necessarily evil, but not quite flawless. Those who have dark chapters in their past they would rather leave behind, like Kira, a former freedom fighter (or terrorist according to the Cardassians). Sisko has his temper, which makes him more human &#8212; we all lose our cool from time to time. Sisko is also unique because his son is on the station &#8212; can you imagine Kirk or Picard worrying about their kids?</p>
<p>Look at Sisko this way: He is a widower, father, company man transferred to a run-down branch office in the middle of nowhere, managing a bitter staff who think they should be running the place (insert Emergency Manager joke). Sisko could be your neighbor. His situation is very believable. The only difference is, Sisko’s office is in outer space.</p>
<p>Why I am really glad these episodes are on Netflix is because I can finally watch the later seasons. I wasn’t watching <em>Deep Space Nine</em> too often when the series started to focus more on war towards the end.</p>
<p>And because of this, I am faced with a (good) problem: do I watch the entire series all the way through, or just focus on the Dominion episodes? I thought of skipping around, but then I remembered <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> (which shares a writer in Ronald D. Moore), and its character driven plot.</p>
<p>Long story short, I have about 170 episodes to go. Good thing the show is on Netflix for another 600+ days.</p>

Fezzes are cool.</p></div> My esteemed college and, more importantly, fellow Sarah, has asserted <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor is the best Doctor</a>. While in every subjective way her opinion is well reasoned and valid, in every objective way her opinion is obviously ill-informed and invalid. Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor is the best of the modern Doctors. </p>
<p>My personal <em>Doctor Who</em> trajectory had me starting, like Sarah, with Nine and I&#8217;d also consider it blasphemy to skip him and go to Ten. But while I watched the modern series as it premiered, I also simultaneously watched some of the classic series thanks to the magic of Netflix. I&#8217;d jump from the grumpy First Doctor to the <em>joie de vivre</em> of the Ninth Doctor, then back to the flamboyant Fourth Doctor, then to the manic Tenth Doctor. The result being I never really imprinted on one particular Doctor or developed a certain expectation for the show. </p>
<p>For me, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether Eleven is the truest incarnation of earlier versions of The Doctor (he is) or whether he&#8217;s the most interesting portrayal of The Doctor (he is) or whether Matt Smith is just the most handsome of the three modern Doctors (oh, yes, he is). What matters is that Eleven is the most believable character. </p>
<p>All my problems with the Tenth Doctor and Russell T. Davies crystallized in the character&#8217;s finale where Ten has to decide whether to give his life for a human, an elderly man he had no particular connection to or affection for. Not the love of his life, not the president, not a child destined for greatness. Just a run-of-the-mill old guy who by his own admission will probably die in a couple years anyhow. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHMBxYXmrTw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>Look at you, not remotely important. But me, I could do so much more!</p></blockquote>
<p>I hate most vampires because they&#8217;re unrealistic, and I don&#8217;t mean the blood sucking part. If you are a thousand-year-old nearly invincible creature, why are you spending your time and energy becoming super BFFs with humans? </p>
<p>I mean, I have a cat. I love my cat. I&#8217;m going to outlive it and be sad when it dies. I&#8217;ll probably get a new cat after that. But no matter how much I love my cat, I&#8217;m not going to give my life for it or pretend my cat or cats in general have any sort of meaningful impact on my life or the world. In what functional way are humans different than cats when it comes to other worldly immortal beings? </p>
<p>Now in the Doctor&#8217;s case, sure, he&#8217;s the last of his kind so he&#8217;s going to get bored and lonely and want to befriend other creatures. I get why Ten finds humanity interesting and wants to hang out with humans. What I don&#8217;t understand is why Ten gets all weepy and martyrs himself for one lousy human. You&#8217;d never see Eleven (or any other Doctor (or any other ancient, nearly invincible being)) giving his life in such a meaningless bargain. He cares more about puzzles than people. </p>
<p>Eleven doesn&#8217;t give a shit. He&#8217;ll promise a kid he&#8217;ll be right back then take another ten or fifteen years to get around to it. Does he care about what he put that kid through? Eh, not really. He has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely. Hanging out with humans is a means to an end: fun. </p>
<p>Taken in isolation as a character, Eleven is unequivocally my favorite but when you start looking at plot, companions, and how it&#8217;s written generally then things get murkier. </p>

Davies tugs at your heart with dramatic emotional plots, Stephen Moffat tugs at your brain with complex intellectual plots. Eleven’s aloofness pairs well with Moffat’s cerebral writing. </p>
<p>When it comes to companions, I don&#8217;t love any of them, and Amy least of all. Her lack of agency in the show is disturbing. (I was really pregnant and in a vat the whole time!) Unfortunately what I love about the character of Eleven, I hate about the writer: Stephen Moffat is extremely misogynistic. From <em>Coupling</em> to <em>Sherlock</em> to <em>Doctor Who</em>, all his leads are characterized by a borderline pathological disregard for women. I still enjoy his shows but it&#8217;s not always easy. </p>
<p>As a show with decades of history and hundreds of people working on it, the quality of the episodes vary wildly. It&#8217;s almost impossible to be a fan of the show and love all of it. Of my DWho friends, I&#8217;m probably the most critical of the show. From the cheesy to the nonsensical to the overblown, for every one episode I love there&#8217;s probably two I hate. But the highs are high and they keep me coming back for more. </p>
<p>Because when you start in on <em>Doctor Who</em> you have to watch it for better or worse, in cheesiness and in earnestness, as long as you both shall endure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I finally decided to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em>. I’m not sure why I hadn’t before. I think it always seemed too hardcore. Everyone I knew who watched the show was constantly making in-jokes with other Who fans. (One indication of how out of it I am: are fans of the show Who fans or Doctor fans?) This is in part because when I was growing up, and indeed up though most of my college years, the show was still on the air. And the folks I knew who watched it? They didn’t just watch the current seasons. No, they went back and watched all the seasons from its start in 1963. (Come to think of it, what did they do before VCRs became readily available? That scarcity might go a long way in explaining the fanaticism of my friends. You have to be hardcore to watch a show in its infancy when it’s not available on streaming, or DVD, or video. You’d have to bond with other people searching out the series instead of sticking with the more readily available <em>Dallas</em> or <em>M*A*S*H*</em>.) (It’s not that I wasn’t a science fiction fan—I have treasured memories of watching <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Star_Trek/70136140" target="_blank">Star Trek</a></em> with my mom, even though that series had stopped, so clearly syndication was available, even back in the dark days of my childhood. But somehow <em>Doctor Who</em> wasn’t part of our picture.)</p>
<p>If I can’t quite explain why I hadn’t watched it before, neither can I explain why I decided to start watching it last year. I suspect that somehow I stumbled across it streaming on Netflix, had nothing else to do, and thought, why not? It might have been after <em>Sherlock</em> was over and I was desperate for something British to watch. I’m not sure. But in any case, the show was baffling and inexplicable and I couldn’t stop watching.</p>

Yes, I laugh knowingly at Dalek jokes, but those are just funny. But a conversation on twitter recently made me realize that I might have my own obsessive corner after all. A tweep announced that he was going to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em> and asked for advice on where to begin—the most recent season? Or back to David Tennant? The consensus, much to my horror, was to begin with David Tennant, aka the Tenth Doctor, who took over the role in the final episode of the return of the series in 2005. I certainly don’t want to cast aspersions on Tennant’s Doctor &#8212; he seems a lovely fellow and all. But the right answer to this question is to start at the beginning of the revived series in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, aka the Best Doctor.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to start the series with the Best Doctor. And I’ll confess that I’m only halfway through the 3<sup>rd</sup> new series (aka the 2007 season), so perhaps Tennant will grow on me, or I’ll discover that Matt Smith, the Eleventh Doctor, is the best of them all. But I doubt it. I think Eccleston has imprinted on me and he’ll be what I always want the Doctor to be. Here’s what I love about him: he’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side (whoops, a bit of childhood <em>Star Wars</em> in there) and becoming too destructive. I suppose that seems like it might reveal more about me than about the show, but I’m not really that much into dangerous men. (Ok, given <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/" target="_blank">my previous attestations of love for Paul Newman</a>, that might not be entirely true, though I will stand by my position that his dangerous persona goes hand-in-hand with his real-life loving-husband, do-gooder one.)</p>
<p>What makes Eccleston work in ways that Tennant doesn’t is that he gives the Doctor an edge. Without that edge, it’s too easily just a series of romps through time with someone who is all-powerful and yet has a tragic history. With Eccleston’s manic danger (a trait that he brings to many of his roles, but that here is balanced with some joy and goodness), you get a sense that there’s something at stake in the Doctor’s adventures. Is he going to destroy the world or save it? There’s no fun in the hero always being the hero. It’s the tension between saving and failing that makes a story compelling. Maybe Tennant comes to that later on, but in his first seasons, he doesn’t hold a candle to Eccleston.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em>, currently streaming seasons 1 through 6 of the new series: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441" target="_blank">http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441</a></p>
<p>Some earlier episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> seem to be streaming on Netflix, too, but honestly, the search interface is such a nightmare that I can’t figure out what order the shows go in, so you’re on your own for finding those. Sorry. I recommend you search on <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/" target="_blank">the Instant Watch Database</a> to see what’s what. If <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/search/main?search=1&amp;searchPage=1&amp;previousTextSearch=&amp;previousSubGenre=0&amp;textSearch=Doctor%20Who&amp;textSearchType=all&amp;genre=0&amp;availability=&amp;rating=&amp;quality=&amp;startYear=1914&amp;endYear=2012&amp;Submit=Instant%20Watch%20Search!" target="_blank">this link</a> hasn’t degraded, it will take you to a nice page with the available episodes listed in order. Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the mid-to-late 1990s. </p>
<p>It was a new Golden Age for the cinema, and 1996 was a banner year: it brought us <em>Barb Wire</em>, <em>Dragonheart</em>, and the Billy Zane superhero film, <em>The Phantom</em>.</p>
<p>I have a soft-spot for The Phantom. Which should not come as a surprise, since my film collection runs the gamut from <em>Seven Samurai</em> and <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>, to <em>Cabin Boy</em> and <em>Army of Darkness</em> (two more 1990s gems). My fondness for the film stems from Billy Zane &#8212; his performance suggests he was enjoying every second of the production.</p>
<p>Sure, Zane’s purple costume is rather laughable in a live-action film, but it works for the Phantom’s universe. It makes sense within its own reality, like how Heath Ledger’s Joker fits the Nolan Batman universe. Look at Xander Drax (Treat Williams) &#8212; he’s an over-the-top villain if there ever was one, and he fits the pulpy style of the film like a glove. </p>
<p>And let us not forget Patrick McGoohan as Zane’s Obi-Wan Kenobi-like father, nor a pre-<em>Mask of Zorro</em> Catherine Zeta-Jones as a bad girl air-pirate. Yes. Air-pirate.</p>
<p><em>The Phantom</em> is a period-piece comic book movie, and that is something special, or at least interesting from a filmmaking stand-point. <em>The Phantom</em> was (at least) the fourth in a line of period-piece comic book films in the 1990s, following <em>Dick Tracy</em>, <em>The Rocketeer</em>, and <em>The Shadow</em>. With the exception of the Rocketeer (created in the 1980s), the other films take place during the time of the comic version’s origin (give or take).</p>
<p>The Phantom comic appeared in 1936, and predates Superman and Batman by only a few years (two and three, respectively). Yet, the modern adaptations of Superman and Batman, those predating and following 1996’s <em>The Phantom</em>, stayed away from the period-piece approach.</p>
<p>I would love to see a period-piece Batman film, although the 1989 Burton film hits close to the mark with its noir style. I would actually be excited to see a Superman movie if it took place in the 1930s (confession: I am not much of a Superman fan). What about Spider-Man in the 1960s? Period-piece comic book films are being made again: <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>X-Men: First Class</em>, and <em>Captain America</em> have all popped up recently (although, save for the first half of <em>X-Men</em>, I can’t really say I enjoyed these three that much).</p>
<p>But, why was <em>The Phantom</em> kept in the 1930s?</p>
<p>There is a fair amount of the supernatural weaving its way through the plot, which might be why it was kept a period-piece (the same goes for <em>The Shadow</em>). That sort of stuff fits a 1930s setting a bit better, perhaps because a film so far in the past is &#8220;different&#8221; to begin with. A world without TV, the internet, and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony is already alien to a modern audience, so I suppose ghosts and supernatural powers don’t stick out as much. Would <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> been better if it were set in the 1980s? I doubt it (aside from any possible Reagan related humor, that is).</p>
<p>And that also might be why <em>The Phantom</em> was not modernized: The plot and action are very Indiana Jones-like, and by the mid-to-late 90s, 1989’s <em>Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade</em> was a fairly distant memory. It is worth noting that <em>The Phantom</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em> share a common plot point: the MacGuffin in each of the films are strange, ancient skulls with magical powers.</p>
<p>But, let’s get back to Billy Zane. He makes this movie. </p>
<p><em>The Phantom</em> is fun only because Zane is having fun &#8212; and it shows. Zane’s casual, tongue-in-cheek approach is endearing, and is a far cry from the super-serious superheroes of today, especially Christian Bale’s Batman. Zane’s Phantom is a guy you want to hang out with as you swap stories over a couple pitchers of beer. </p>
<p>Plus, he punches people while wearing skull rings and has a pet wolf named Devil. What’s not to like? Slam evil!</p>
