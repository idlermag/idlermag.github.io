										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent video game film, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> (2012), has been called by some &#8220;the best video game movie ever made.&#8221; On the surface, that sounds like quite the endorsement, but if you dig deeper, such a title doesn&#8217;t carry much weight when you look at the rest of the sample in question.</p>
<p>In short, it is almost like calling <em>Rambo III</em> (1988) &#8220;the best Rambo-goes-to-Afghanistan movie ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s an exaggeration, but not far from the mark.</p>
<p>The original <em>Tron</em> (1982) is perhaps the only other video game film worthy of battling <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> for the title of &#8220;best video game ever,&#8221; because let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; most video game movies ain&#8217;t that good.</p>
<p>One would think, with plenty of captivating stories played out on home consoles every day, making a great video game movie would be easy. For some reason it is not.</p>
<p>Why? I don&#8217;t know, maybe, unlike <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, most video game films don&#8217;t embrace their video-gameness. <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not, which is the Achilles&#8217; heel of most video game films. <em>Resident Evil</em> (2002)? How do you screw up a special forces team fighting zombies in a spooky mansion?</p>
<p><em>Street Fighter</em> (1994)? That is worthy of its own article. Man, I waited <em>in line</em> on opening night to see that turkey.</p>
<p>And then there is the gold standard of failed video game films: <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (1993).</p>
<p>I confess to <strong>a)</strong> seeing <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in the theater on opening weekend and <strong>b)</strong> owning the DVD.</p>
<p>Yes, years later, as an adult, I made the conscious decision to own the film.</p>
<p>Is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8220;good&#8221;? That depends on what one considers good. Story-wise, no, not really. It&#8217;s just strange. Entertainment-wise, yes, because it is so ridiculous. Get some beers, call over your friends, and put on <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8212; there is no way you don&#8217;t enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Plus, Mojo Nixon <a title="video on youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4_nFgY7PZA">has a cameo</a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4_nFgY7PZA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Why is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <b>so</b> strange? Because it didn&#8217;t embrace its video-gameness. The film tries to explain the <em>hows</em> and <em>whys</em> of the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> universe, which is its biggest mistake &#8212; but it is also the reason why it is so hilarious.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the film in a vacuum. If the screenwriters were told &#8220;try to explain how this universe with King Koopa and mushroom people could really happen,&#8221; they made quite the effort. An asteroid knocking dinosaurs into a parallel dimension, where they evolved into humanoids? OK.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great for an episode of <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Sliders</em>, but it doesn&#8217;t really belong in a movie about <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need realistic explanations for plumbers growing into giants or shooting fireballs at angry turtles as they try to save a princess. People accept <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> for what it is: <b>fantasy</b>.</p>
<p>And this is how <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> earned its many praises: it ups the fantasy and doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not. There isn&#8217;t any screen time devoted to <i>why</i> the video game characters are &#8220;alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>They just <i>are</i>, and that is good enough for me.</p>
<p>But, on some level, I am glad <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> tried to be as serious as it is &#8212; otherwise, I may not have one of my favorite bad movies to watch with friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It probably says a lot about me that the first show I ever recorded with a DVR was ALF. No, not some new reboot. The <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JDUBE2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JDUBE2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank">original show from the 1980s</a>. Yes, I now have access to a state of the art TV recording device, and I use it to record sitcom reruns.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>Like most who share my 31 years, I grew up watching ALF. I remember watching reruns after school as a kid. This might explain how I developed my own smart-mouth sarcastic humor (and perhaps, my fondness for cats). As a kid, the show&#8217;s draw was it had a puppet. But, as an adult, I get much, much more of the humor and enjoy its brilliant absurdity.</p>
<p>OK, and I still like that it has a puppet.</p>
<p>I watched a favorite episode the other day &#8212; where the Tanners throw a Halloween party, and ALF shows up with a zipper taped to his chest to pass off as a guest (<a href="http://alf.wikia.com/wiki/Some_Enchanted_Evening" target="_blank">“Some Enchanted Evening”</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still laughing about it. Yes, it was a cheesy, simple gag, but I loved it. The visual is hilarious on two levels &#8212; the zipper looks totally out of place, and ALF interacting with a room full of adults, instead of just the Tanners, really puts the focus on his shortness.</p>
<p>Ah, <em>sitcoms</em>.</p>
<p>The episode also has one of my favorite comedic reversals. I&#8217;m paraphrasing here, but it goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Willie: Where did you get that zipper?</p>
<p>ALF: You know that old jacket you&#8217;ve been meaning to throw out?</p>
<p>Willie: Yeah.</p>
<p>ALF: Well, you might wanna hang on to it. I ripped this out of your new raincoat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! Classic.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care much for sitcoms these days, but I will always watch ALF when I can. Maybe it is the connection to my youth, or maybe it is the humor.</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, I like smart-mouth puppets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eddie Murphy has made plenty of odd films. But, at least his odd film of the 1980s was odd in an interesting way, not because he wore a fat suit.</p>
<p><a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305310351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=6305310351&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>The Golden Child</em></a> (1986) is odd, because it blends action, comedy, fantasy, and elements of Chinese mysticism.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Yes, <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUCQX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QUCQX8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>Big Trouble in Little China</em></a> has all of those things too (and they came out the same year).</p>
<p>But, only one of these films has Eddie Murphy, and that is the big difference (even though Kurt Russel is great in <em>Big Trouble</em>). I have read <em>The Golden Child</em> was <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Child#Production_details">originally planned</a> as a very serious adventure film, but when Murphy was brought on, it switched gears.</p>
<p>So, now you have Eddie Murphy fighting demons, traveling to Tibet, and searching for magical weapons.</p>
<p>Ah, the 1980s. What an era for film.</p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s humor and comedic timing help balance the mystical elements of the film. Had this film taken itself more seriously, I doubt it would have been nearly as enjoyable. Just when the story gets really deep into the mystical side, there&#8217;s Murphy with a joke, or a goofy expression to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>When you have a story with a demon in human form trying to feed a supernatural child blood to weaken his powers, you need a few jokes here and there. It helps keep the dark, occult themes (of which there are many) from overpowering the story.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some &#8220;whatever&#8221; moments, such as when Murphy has to carry a glass of water through an obstacle course without spilling a drop. And, why is a social worker The Chosen One who can save The Child?</p>
<p>But who cares? There is also a dragon lady. And let us not forget the classic, “I want the knife” scene.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr0JXSM_0Nk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I have probably watched this film, in part or in whole, about a hundred times. It was a fixture on TV in my youth. It was almost always on at any given point, especially the weekends. Sure, it is an odd film, but it has a bit charm, thanks to Eddie Murphy in his prime. This was just after <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>, when he could do no wrong.</p>
<p>Some might disagree, and say <em>The Golden Child</em> was Murphy&#8217;s only stumble during his string of hits in the 1980s. Compared to his other films of the eighties, <em>The Golden Child</em> sticks out like a sore thumb, but only due to its plot. In terms of box office, the film was a success (although, I have read, not in the eyes of the studio).</p>
<p>And as someone who grew up in the 1980s, <em>The Golden Child</em> was a success in keeping me entertained. Over and over again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hard Target (1993) will always go down as &#8220;John Woo&#8217;s first American film.&#8221; But, it should also go down as a hell of a crazy movie.

Crazy in an entertaining way no less (at least to me).</p>
<p>In <em>Hard Target</em> you have a movie with mid-prime Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lance Henriksen (who always excels at crazy), the guy who played the Mummy in <a title="Names escape me." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JQB5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00000JQB5&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>The Mummy</em></a>, and Wilfred Brimley as a Cajun moonshiner. Add strange guns, motorcycles, Van Damme&#8217;s martial arts, John Woo&#8217;s over-the-top style, and you have a highly entertaining 97 minutes of celluloid.</p>
<p>Did I mention at one point Van Damme fires a pistol while holding it upside down?</p>
<p>Oh man, does he ever. I don&#8217;t mean twisting his arm around either, I mean holding the gun like he doesn&#8217;t know which end is up. It is brilliant in its absurdity &#8212; and I love it.</p>
<p>In Woo&#8217;s oeuvre, <em>Hard Target</em> comes right after <a title="Watch it. WATCH IT" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N4SHNK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000N4SHNK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>Hard Boiled</em></a> (1992) &#8212; a film every action fan must watch (and subtitled, not dubbed). If you watch <em>Hard Boiled</em> and <em>Hard Target</em> back to back (and why not?) you will notice a few things: John Woo loves guys firing automatic weapons atop motorcycles, and doves. Yes, doves. One even leads Van Damme to a clue.</p>
<p>An aside: Woo&#8217;s <a title="Classic." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036BDQBU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0036BDQBU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>The Killer</em></a> (1989) is another must watch.</p>
<p>Back to <em>Hard Target</em>: Jean-Claude Van Damme&#8217;s hair. Oh. My. Goodness. It is a sight to behold. His mullet is the stuff of legends, so much that I immediately thought of it while <a title="Comic!" href="http://clattertron.com/2012/09/10/mullets/" target="_blank">drawing a comic about mullets</a>.</p>
<p>And let us not forget Mr. Oatmeal himself, Wilfred Brimley. In his finest work since <em>Ewoks: The Battle for Endor</em>, Brimley plays Van Damme&#8217;s recluse, moonshiner uncle. With a Cajun accent no less. It is glorious.</p>
<p>The only thing more glorious is when Van Damme punches a snake and [spoiler alert] bites off its rattle. It is a jaw dropping moment, and I could watch the scene on repeat all day.</p>
<p>Has Woo made better movies? Yes, of course (again, see: <em>The Killer</em> and <em>Hard Boiled</em>). Is <em>Hard Target</em> perfect? Absolutely not. But, does that matter? No. <em>Hard Target</em> is fun &#8212; and it is a great time capsule of early 1990s action films.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The range of my taste in film covers a wide area. </p>
<p>If my tastes were represented by a country&#8217;s land area, it would be Russia. Despite my fiancée&#8217;s insistence that I don&#8217;t like any film made after 2000 &#8212; mainly because I had not watched <em>Superbad</em> until last week &#8212; I enjoy many different films. My film collection would suggest as much, which ranges from Oscar winning classics of the 1960s to b-movies of the 1980s, and many more. </p>
<p>One film that holds a place of honor on my shelf is the Bruce Willis vehicle, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/" target="_blank">Hudson Hawk</a></em> (1991). It is absurd, ridiculous, and preposterous. </p>
<p>And I love every damn frame. I love the film so much, I even referenced it in <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/13/microsoft-outlook/" target="_blank">one of my comic strips</a>. </p>
<p>I have a soft-spot for absurd action-comedies, and Hudson Hawk is more or less my gold standard. It is also on the short list of films I have purchased in two or more formats: first VHS, and then DVD (<em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, and <em>Army of Darkness</em> being the others. <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> will join that list eventually. <em>Gremlins</em>, however, is the reigning champ: VHS, DVD, and Laserdisc—in that order).</p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> is a love it or hate it film. </p>
<p>Folks I know who love the film, love it to pieces and quote it often (the film is incredibly quotable: “You took down Captain Bob&#8217;s steering wheel?!”, “Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!”, “Hey Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.”). </p>
<p>But, for those who can&#8217;t embrace the absurdity, <em>Hudson Hawk</em> is the worst thing put to celluloid this side of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero" target="_blank">Last Action Hero</a></em> (the subject of a future article). </p>
<p>Is <em>Hudson Hawk</em> a perfect film? Hardly.</p>
<p>But, it is entertaining and hilarious (keep in mind this comes from a guy who draws comics rife with <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/06/schmoopy/" target="_blank">absurd humor</a>). It is full of gags I love to death. The scene where the Pope is watching Mr. Ed dubbed into Italian gets me every time. Another favorite (and speaking as someone who is half-Italian) is when an Italian guard pours spaghetti, with sauce, out of a Thermos.</p>
<p>Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello, to me, form an impressive comedic duo. I love their snappy dialogue and banter. They have chemistry, and they come across as real pals. If you go into <em>Hudson Hawk</em> expecting a <em>Die Hard</em>, you will be incredibly disappointed (although the same could probably be said of <em>Die Hard 2</em>). Yet, if you approach <em>Hudson Hawk</em> as a poor man&#8217;s <em>Ghostbusters</em> or <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>, it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>Maybe. I don&#8217;t make any promises.</p>
<p>If you can find the DVD, give the director commentary by Michael Lehmann a listen. It is as entertaining as it is informative, and I love Lehmann&#8217;s refrain of “Did I mention this film did well in Europe?” after some of the gags. He also explains several scenes which were cut from the film, including a sub-plot about Willis getting revenge for the death of his monkey sidekick, Little Eddie (YES). </p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> isn&#8217;t perfect, and it isn&#8217;t for everyone, but for those, like myself, who enjoy absurdity, it is 100 minutes well spent. </p>
<p>And it is way funnier than <em>Die Hard 2</em>.</p>
