										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need to start this off by saying (writing) that when Gavin Craig approached me (instant messenged me) about this idea &#8212; starting a web-zine stocked with writers drawn from our group of quirky, nerdish pals and their quirky, nerdish pals &#8212; my biggest worry was making sure I was producing content as interesting, and varied, as other writers. As a writer, I think it&#8217;s important to carve out your own niche &#8212; to stake your claim to the thing you&#8217;re going to do better than anyone else. Now, I might not be able to out-stat the Moneyball-obsessed fan. I confess to not being able to identify pitches and suffer complete lapses of common-sense when it comes to the strategic aspects of the game at times. But I think that points to what I try to do better than any other baseball writer: to nail down the guts of the game, the instinct you (as a player) have to throw it to second when it doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>My first column, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/08/31/miggy-and-the-minors/">&#8220;Miggy and the minors,&#8221;</a> tried to get at this a little, I think. I wrote about the epic awesomeness of Miguel Cabrera &#8212; who I still believe should have been the AL MVP last year &#8212; at a time when everything around him was going south. Once again, the Tigers were tanking after the All-Star break &#8212; but Miggy, like the beast I compared him to from Yeats&#8217; poem &#8220;The Second Coming,&#8221; dragged the rag-tag team along with him to at least keep the chances of a pennant run alive a little longer.</p>
<p>Looking back, that seems to have paid off for the Tigers now &#8212; and for my conception of Miggy as the epic hero. If Miggy had gone Juan Gone on his teammates and eased up (and, hey, who would blame him, really, for letting off the gas when he was the only one revving the team&#8217;s engine?) I don&#8217;t think this year&#8217;s team would show the grit to do what they&#8217;ve done: sweep the Indians; come back from behind to take down the Royals; go deep into the bullpen to muscle out a win.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes Miggy a hero &#8212; he inspires greatness in the rest of his team.</p>
<p>A guy like Alex Avila is a great example. He&#8217;s got talent, work ethic, pedigree. Does he become an All-Star catcher who looks like he&#8217;s been in the league for ten years without learning a bit of that poise and determination from Cabrera? Not sure, but I like to think Miggy rubbed off on him. Same for Brennan Boesch, who&#8217;s clearly absorbed some of Cabrera&#8217;s plate approach this year &#8212; helped, no doubt, by his fluent Spanish.</p>
<p>Of course, at times he is a tragic hero (see: <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/22/in-which-miguel-cabrera-breaks-my-motherfucking-heart/">&#8220;In which Miguel Cabrera breaks my motherfucking heart&#8221;</a>). But he&#8217;s human. And sweet sassy molassy, I just love him.</p>
<p>But beyond how awesome I was in the beginning (snark), what has really been badass about <em>The Idler</em> is how much my own writing, and even the way I am thinking about the things I write about, has been influenced and augmented by the other <em>Idler</em> columnists.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a column I wished I had written, and one I think of often when I write my own stuff, it&#8217;s Ana Holguin&#8217;s <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/05/25/the-macho-man-vs-the-family-secrets/">invocation of another hero and the place he held in her younger years</a>. She just nailed so much so perfectly: nostalgia, heroes (that in childhood seem so much more tangible), mental illness, family, longing.</p>
<p>Having a bunch of smart bastards around has challenged me, too, to think about my beloved baseball in different ways.  Kate Sloan&#8217;s piece on <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/03/gaying-up-gotham/">the homoerotic overtones of <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em></a> not only inspired me to read the graphic novel (which was AWESOME) but to think harder about the role of sex, sexuality and gender in baseball. Without Kate&#8217;s work, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have written <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/06/28/pandering-with-p-words/">&#8220;Pandering with p-words.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I could go on forever about <em>The Idler</em>. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of it, and I can&#8217;t wait to get back to writing. (I&#8217;ve been on an unscheduled hiatus &#8212; who knew switching jobs would be so time-consuming?)</p>
<p>A few things I&#8217;m working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>I picked up a copy of Rickey Henderson&#8217;s <em>Off Base</em> yesterday (FOR 25 CENTS!), so I&#8217;ll be rocking some paleo-blogging on that bad boy.</li>
<li><em>Moneyball</em> hits theatres this month, and I&#8217;m planning a man-date with some of my softball buddies. Expect a review, and answer to the burning question, Will Brad Pitt be believable as a man who is not incredibly attractive?</li>
<li>There&#8217;s some stuff to catch up on, like a review of my progress as a third baseman and my goals for the winter. (Yep, I&#8217;m going to go back to the coach to get some more bruises.)</li>
<li>And it&#8217;s pennant time, and then playoff time.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a lot to look forward to. Thanks for staying with us this far.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re here today to celebrate the union of Laura and Ben, and provide witness to their enduring partnership.</p>
<p>Partnership. </p>
<p>When I spoke with Laura and Ben about what they wanted me to say today, that&#8217;s the one word that came up again and again.</p>
<p>And, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, we can&#8217;t talk about partnerships without talking about the best partnership in the history of the word:</p>
<p>Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker.</p>
<p>For those of you who didn&#8217;t grow up in Michigan, obsessed with the Detroit Tigers, a little history:</p>
<p>Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell played side by side for nineteen seasons. </p>
<p>They started out together at Double A Montgomery, where they first assumed the roles that would define them: Whitaker at second base, Trammell at short stop.</p>
<p>For nineteen seasons, one World Series Championship, seven Gold Gloves and eleven All-Star selections, they did together the same things Laura and Ben have, and will do together.</p>
<p>You anticipate your partner&#8217;s needs. </p>
<p>You cover their back when they make a mistake.</p>
<p>When they end up on their back, you offer your hand.</p>
<p>Now, we&#8217;re not here to talk about baseball &#8212; but we can learn a few things from Lou and Alan.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s all about <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121260/index.htm" target="_blank">WE</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the damndest thing,&#8221; Houk said. &#8220;You tell one of them something and he says, &#8216;We can do it.&#8217; Like they&#8217;re a team.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Second, you do the big stuff together &#8212; and you support each other.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1977 they roomed and played together at Montgomery in the Class AA Southern League. &#8220;We did everything together,&#8221; says Whitaker. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have anybody else.&#8221; Says Trammell, &#8220;We comforted each other a little. If one of us had a bad night, the other one wouldn&#8217;t let it get him down. We sort of used each other as crutches, and we became pretty close.&#8221; </p>
<p>Whitaker hit .280. Trammell batted .291, broke Reggie Jackson&#8217;s league record for triples with 19 and was named league MVP. Brinkman, their manager, says, &#8220;They could&#8217;ve been co-MVPs that year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And last, you complement one another.</p>
<p>Being partners doesn&#8217;t mean being the same. Lou batted lefty, Alan from the right side. </p>
<p>And being partners means loving each other for your faults, not just your talents.</p>
<p>For all the gold gloves, Trammell was such a klutz that no one wanted to sit next to him at dinner &#8212; they&#8217;d end up covered in his spaghetti.</p>
<p>Lou, for all his natural athletic prowess, couldn&#8217;t lay off the junk food. That&#8217;s why they called him Sweet Lou. </p>
<p>Neither was perfect, but together, they were close. </p>
<p>To me, that&#8217;s what a good partnership is &#8212; you&#8217;re each pretty great on your own. That much, everyone here knows already.</p>
<p>But together, you&#8217;re better. Together, you&#8217;re champs.</p>
<p>Laura and Ben, as you being the next phase of your lives together, I can think of nothing more to wish for you than that you become co-MVPs; that you conquer the challenges of life the way Lou and Alan conquered the infield: together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two weeks ago, in a corner suite on the fourth floor of the very lovely Hotel Rouge in Washington, D.C.&#8217;s tony Dupont Circle neighborhood, I lay on a king sized bed, finished my quinoa/ dried berry / green leaf lettuce / dinner salad, and read the last ten pages of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone</em>.</p>
<p>For the first time.</p>
<p>Ever.</p>
<p>Mind you, it&#8217;s no accident I made it this long without reading them. My roommate in college discovered the novel the summer after our freshman year &#8212; that would have been June, 1999. She adored it, and began reading each as it debuted, even organizing midnight Harry Potter parties at the independent bookseller in our hometown.</p>
<p>But I, ever the hater of all things beloved by everyone else, turned my nose up. Not only did my snobbish disdain for something I&#8217;d not read a word of give me the ability to do something unusual &#8212; that is, feel superior to my fellow English majors &#8212; it fit into my aesthetics formed &#8212; where else &#8212; in baseball.</p>
<p>To my mind, Harry Potter was like the Yankees: given every possible advantage for success without working hard enough to make the real fan, the burgeoning 18th c. literature aficionado, feel they&#8217;d earned it. British author? Check. Charming, if easy, narrative? Check check. Accessible for all? Checkity check check check.</p>
<p>But I was wrong. Harry isn&#8217;t a Yankee, though he is born under the burden of heavy expectation. He&#8217;s not Derek Jeter, a seemingly charmed (if likeable) hero. He&#8217;s certainly not Jason Giambi, or Alex Rodriguez &#8212; players who couldn&#8217;t seem to live up to their hype until they were lampreyed onto some greater player&#8217;s underbelly.</p>
<p>No, Harry was Johnny Damon. Johnny of an unknowable level of talent in his early years in Kansas City, Johnny with his lightning strike speed and freakish outfield instinct in Oakland. Johnny in Boston, not fully realizing until the 2004 ALCS, perhaps, just how great a foe he and his teammates were up against, Johnny and his ragtag gang of self-named misfits, the idiots, lacking pedigree and pinstripe. </p>
<p>The Yankees were Voldemort. (How else to explain A-Rod&#8217;s spectacularly nefarious swatting of the ball from the first baseman&#8217;s glove?) An evil, long-simmering force that took over seemingly decent people and turned them into entitled, unappreciative fan-monsters. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in any hurry to read the rest &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a stack of library books higher than Johnny&#8217;s current Mohawk taking precedence &#8212; but I&#8217;m finally learning the lesson about the book and the cover and judgment. Or, at least, the lesson about making sure you assign the correct judgment to said book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first round of the State Farm Home Run Derby lasted two hours. Despite running 3 miles in the gross humidity just before it started, I decided to tweet it &#8212; I toweled off first.</p>
<p>Between my own disgusting scent and the presence of the vile Chris Berman (on television &#8212; not in my home), I was a little cranky. Not Joe Buck is on cranky, but close.</p>
<p>A selection of tweets, below. You can go check <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/motheroflight" target="_blank">my Twitter feed</a> for everything &#8212; including the duds I edited out to make it appear that I am a 1.000 hitter when it comes to the funny. Instead of, you know, .500.</p>

<p>And, yeah, we get that far less than zero percent of all advertising or promotional marketing is aimed at us. </p>
<p>Which is fine. I don&#8217;t need a pink Detroit Tigers cap, or a pink baseball shaped keychain, or a pink whatever &#8212; even though I really do like the color pink and its various incarnations. </p>

The hero, a football-loving man (the audience is always assumed to be male), is so oppressed by his wife&#8217;s relentless nagging that we (more men) are meant to empathize with him and root for him when he, say, leaves his wife off the guest list for the party in their home.</p>
<p>Oh, and the home is now full of hot bitches drinking some frosty beer, natch. </p>
<p>Fine. Maybe most male sports fans aren&#8217;t &#8220;fan&#8221; enough to watch an entire telecast without the requisite tit shots to hold their attention. Or perhaps Coors really does get a huge bump in sales from men watching these games and living under such horrific matriarchal regimes &#8212; who knows.</p>
<p>What I do know is that, when my friends (ladies) and I watch sports, we somehow manage to make it through the entire event without some scrotal cleavage being dangled along the sidelines to keep us too transfixed to turn away. </p>
<p>Yet I cannot attend or watch any major sporting event (save international soccer) without having some half-naked woman tossed out and bobbed along the sidelines like a lure on a fishing line. The USC sweater girls? The endless NCAA tourney upskirts? The barely-contained silicon juggernauts of Tampa Bay and Dallas, ass hanging out from booty shorts? Even hockey has them &#8212; the ladies in (what else?) booty shorts and midriff-baring mini-team-tanks scooping up piles of ice shavings.</p>

<p>And what do we get? Well, we get no reprieve. We get the same sweaty ass of the nose tackle, his jock strap clearly visible through his soaked white pants. We get David Beckham puking. We get men at their sweatiest, and most disgusting. Sometimes, if we&#8217;re lucky, they&#8217;ll have interesting facial hair or spectacular muscles.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be honest here: women do not watch sports for the eye candy. Perhaps men don&#8217;t, either, but they get the eye candy as a bizarre reward for watching something they should be fan enough to watch anyway. </p>
<p>My point being: it was bad enough before.</p>
<p>Now, we have this. </p>

<p>Now, every broadcast of Tigers games on Fox Sports Detroit &#8212; which otherwise does a fair job of avoiding the &#8220;now watch this jiggle&#8221; sports marketing trend &#8212; features these women, either in the stands or in some thirty-second vignette delivering a stilted, generic monologue about baseball. &#8220;I still remember my first game.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. I exaggerate, but you get the point. If the essay question were, tell me about a cherished memory, and that were your answer, you&#8217;d fail. And that&#8217;s what this whole bullshit campaign is: a fail.</p>
<p>First, it completely insults any fan &#8212; male, female, gay or straight &#8212; who watches baseball just because they like baseball. It&#8217;s the equivalent of your boss giving you a gold star for showing up to work and speaking to you like a kindergartner. It&#8217;s like being spoken to as if you were a puppy: &#8220;Aw, there&#8217;s a good boy! You stayed with us after the commercial break. Now watch me smile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, it adds nothing to the game. There&#8217;s a big difference between Erin Andrews &#8212; who is insanely hot but also a fucking good journalist with stellar credentials who actually worked her way up &#8212; and these two, &#8220;Lauren&#8221; and &#8220;Allison,&#8221; whose only qualifications for the &#8220;job&#8221; seem to be being attractive, photogenic, and craving attention from somewhat famous dudes. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re worse than cheerleaders, who have athletic talent and are victims of creepy cameramen and gross color commentators. They&#8217;re worse than the hockey girls, who, scantily clad and overly made-up though they are, still perform the valuable service of cleaning the ice. </p>
<p>This? This is pandering. This is insulting. It&#8217;s John McCain choosing Sarah Palin. It&#8217;s the slow-motion running sequences of Pam Anderson on Baywatch. It&#8217;s the worst of every other sport, made more ludicrous. </p>
<p>This is baseball, assholes. And I prefer mine without the barely-concealed message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something special is happening right now.</p>
<p>Alex Avila is flirting with. 300, the first Tigers catcher to hit so well since Lance Parrish. In fact, he took a turn at third base just to keep his offense in the lineup during interleague play. </p>
<p>If life were fair, he&#8217;d be the undeniable starting catcher for the American League at the All-Star Game. But life isn&#8217;t fair, and ignorant asshole Yankee fans are voting half their geriatric lineup into the game.</p>
<p>Obviously, some things never change.</p>
<p>Except for the things that do. </p>
<p>For once, the Twins and White Sox aren&#8217;t dominating the AL Central. For once, Ozzie Guillen&#8217;s brand of managerial jackassery isn&#8217;t paying dividends as his team hovers in the middle of the pack. For once, Joe Mauer isn&#8217;t the Tom Brady of baseball, wooing sportscasters with his impeccable hair and fundamentally, aesthetically perfect swing. He&#8217;s a catcher who&#8217;s already started to break down.</p>
<p>Leg weakness, the mystery injury that landed him on the DL for so much of the first half, might be an apt metaphor for what&#8217;s happened to the Twins and the Sox this season: something at the base is failing. </p>
<p>But the opposite is happening in Detroit. </p>
<p>Finally, the base is strong. Finally, Cabrera has protection in front of and behind him. Finally, the bottom of the lineup isn&#8217;t a three man barren wasteland of strikeouts and wasted at-bats. Finally, the Tigers aren’t just about one man, one bat.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one man, however, who seems to personify the tigers this season: Justin Verlander. JV, like Steve Yzerman before him, adjusted his game to make his team better. Obviously, he can still mow &#8217;em down, but by pitching to contact he can go deeper into games &#8212; with multiple complete games already in the books this season, giving a thin bullpen adequate rest. </p>
<p>More than anything else, he is showing the team how to win: by putting the team ahead of your own stats; and in his case, that approach is netting a very special season.</p>
<p>So while the Tigers flirt with first, and Verlander winks at no-hitters every outing, and every man on the bench seems to have finally gotten it, it might feel a little bit like we&#8217;re living in bizarro world.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re not, fans. This is a brave new world, a world where the Tigers at the top is exactly how things are supposed to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong> He&#8217;s <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/raburry01-bat.shtml" target="_blank">a mediocre hitter</a> who <a href="http://beck.mlblogs.com/2011/06/06/ryan-raburn-and-track-records/" target="_blank">heats up as the season wears on</a> but doesn&#8217;t really seem to learn much as the years advance. To wit, his strikeouts have been nearly dead even with—or eclipsed—his hit total every year he&#8217;s recorded stats in the majors.</p>
<p>Despite having played alongside some of the best hitters in terms of creating quality at bats—Placido Polanco, Miguel Cabrera—Raburn seems, more often than not, to just swing at whatever pitch comes after strike two. And miss. As a fan, that&#8217;s frustrating. How can he not learn? Doesn&#8217;t the osmotic effect of just sharing an oxygen supply with these hitters translate into more plate discipline?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> He&#8217;s a defensive nightmare.</p>
<p>He misplays the ball in left more often than he gets it right, almost to comic effect. (Side note: that he sometimes laughs it off is either endearing or maddening, take your pick.)</p>

<p>And of course, there are legions of Tigers fans who heap all the blame for the bonus game loss to the Minnesota Twins—which officially eliminated the Tigers from the playoffs, something they&#8217;d been desperately trying to do on their own since the All-Star break—on Raburn because <a href="http://eyeofthetigers.com/tag/game-163/" target="_blank">he, yes, misplayed the ball</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Raburn&#8217;s just a guy in need of, as someone said of a colleague I cannot believe will ever rise to meet his job duties, just a little more confidence. But looking at him, you wonder if maybe that&#8217;s not part of it.</p>
<p><a href="http://lansinghitclub.com" target="_blank">My coach</a> reminds me that production at the plate starts with confidence: confidence that you&#8217;re making the right choice in laying off that ball out of the strike zone even though your protect-the-plate instinct is trigger happy with any count ending in -2, and—compounding and augmenting that first choice—confidence that you can put the strike that is coming in play.</p>
<p>I remember, as a young player, sometimes swinging just to strike out rather than face the anxiety and pressure head on; having to produce when that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s required is probably the most challenging aspect of baseball, and the reason why a shade above mediocrity, by some standards, is greatness.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> &#8220;I&#8217;m just a country boy,&#8221; he&#8217;s said countless times.</p>
<p>He was a country boy of 22 years when he was the major casualty of what can only be described as a hellish all-terrain vehicle accident that left him with a dislocated hip and a few broken bones that were never diagnosed, simply because the doctors never thought to check anything but the horrific, obvious injury of a hip and leg stuck at an impossible angle.</p>
<p><em>The Detroit News</em> had a superb story on it last year toward the end of the season; the link is now expired. A detail I&#8217;ll not forget anytime soon: that he had to be driven on bumpy, rural roads—sans painkillers—for hours to the nearest hospital. Imagine that. Shudder.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that playing baseball again—at all—was not even a remote certainty, and sometimes you wonder if Raburn doesn&#8217;t need to be reminded that this opportunity in the Majors is one he&#8217;s earned. Indeed, it&#8217;s one he had to earn more than once, and he owes it to himself—and every moment he dedicated to what had to have been a nightmare of a recovery and rehab—to just take that last step and reach his potential, even if that potential tops out at .280.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Sometimes, he&#8217;s a victim. As Pat Caputo points out, Raburn&#8217;s best position is second base. And, as baseball writer Jon Morosi noted during another sub-par outfield performance last week, it&#8217;s hard to fault Raburn for his left-field letdowns when manager Jim Leyland names him the everyday 2B and then promptly goes a week without playing him at the bag.</p>
<p>Maybe, like a toddler, he needs a few things: a little more discipline (at the plate), a little more love (and confidence), and a set schedule—like starting at second base for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost as if, for a guy like Raburn, the perception creates the reality. When he feels secure, he flourishes—as in <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_06_05_detmlb_chamlb_1&amp;mode=recap&amp;c_id=det" target="_blank">Sunday&#8217;s timely, desperately-needed blast that plated four runs when the Tigers were down</a>.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;d that bit of security come from? Teammate Miguel Cabrera:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His game is like waves,&#8221; Miguel Cabrera said. &#8220;Right now, he&#8217;s worried because he&#8217;s not hitting too much, he&#8217;s not hitting for average. I said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s going to be your time. Get your timing, be ready. It&#8217;s a long season. We&#8217;re going to need you.&#8217; And you see what happened today. He got a big home run for us today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cabrera had been giving encouragement to Raburn in recent days as he saw Raburn continue to press. He had been kidding with him, too, that the second half was just around the corner and that&#8217;s when he gets hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take one day at a time. You don&#8217;t get big numbers in one day. You have to do something every day, play hard every day, and at the end of the season, I think the numbers are going to be there. That&#8217;s why I told him, &#8216;Don&#8217;t worry about that.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, my friend Zack sent me a link to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/sports/great-sports-nicknames-like-magic-are-disappearing.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=sports" target="_blank">the New York Times bit about the lack of legendary nicknames</a>, a subject <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/09/07/the-importance-of-being-ernie-not-ernest-or-how-nicknames-make-legends/">I meditated on</a> way back at the beginning of this column&#8217;s career. </p>
<p>The <em>Times</em>, of course, picking up on something that&#8217;s been written better and with more nuance by people who actually enjoy and watch the sport&mdash;i.e., not just a Yankees fan&mdash;is not news. That the paper&#8217;s home team roster is jam-packed with nicknameless players, and the player whose absolutely derivative moniker started the worst trend this side of hipsters, is simply the Cool Whip on the strawberry shortcake.</p>
<p>But all snark aside, it is time that I finally attempt to answer my own question: </p>
<p>What, then, should we be calling these men?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an agency of limited resources (being just one very small woman with a bruised up knee from the douchebag who knocked me over at third because, hey, who slides for close plays anyway?), so let&#8217;s tackle the neediest player first.</p>
<p>Lucky for you and my knee, the excellent folks over at <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/" target="_blank">Pitchers &amp; Poets</a>&mdash;who also brought us <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/1990s-first-baseman-week/" target="_blank">90s First Baseman Week</a> and <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/16/casting-call-1990s-first-basemen-as-saved-by-the-bell-characters/" target="_blank">90s First Basemen as Saved By The Bell Characters</a>&mdash;identified a worthy young man: one <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/14/miguel-cabrera-the-man-with-no-nickname/" target="_blank">Jose Miguel Cabrera</a>.</p>
<p>During a game against the Blue Jays last week, Miguel scored from first on a Brennan Boesch hit. The big man lumbered as gracefully as a man his size could on his approach toward home, sort of like a 747 landing: if you watch it and think about it, it&#8217;s amazing it ever happens without anyone dying. </p>
<p>The inimitable Rod Allen (<a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/04/19/5086/">who you know I love</a>) remarked, during the slow motion replay, &#8220;And the Big Fella, carrying the mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, of course The Big Fella is a kind of adorable nickname, but it&#8217;s more a term of endearment than a moniker on equal footing with Prince Albert or Sparky or even, yes, A-Rod. </p>
<p>In a bit of serendipity, earlier that day Jim Leyland <a href="http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2011/05/detroit_tigers_first_baseman_m_1.html" target="_blank">reflected on Miguel&#8217;s workhorse ethic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>…His back was sore and he has a big bruise on his leg. But he plays. That kid, he&#8217;s a champ. He&#8217;s like the mailman&mdash;rain, sleet or snow and he shows up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cabrera, the only Tiger to start all 36 games, was in the American League&#8217;s top 10 in batting average (.320), home runs (seven) and RBIs (24).</p>
<p>What should we call this man, who plays every day and just hits and hits and hits, who never seems to think that what he&#8217;s doing is anything spectacular&mdash;as Carl Crawford said, Cabrera is always talking about how he is struggling at the plate, can&#8217;t get comfortable, all the while hitting .360&mdash;who just seems to go back to the plate each day and put together a quality at-bat?</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking I&#8217;m about to suggest, but you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>Il Postino.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one part The Great Bambino, one part working class hero. </p>
<p>It fits, no? </p>
<p>Il Postino. </p>
<p>In a place like Michigan, where we had one 80 degree day last week and we&#8217;re getting frost tonight, you need a guy with a slightly postal approach to life&mdash;a guy who can weather any storm, be it one of his own making or one of God&#8217;s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s in a beard?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a hockey fan (as I am) you know that a playoff beard is part of standard lore, and you probably looked forward to seeing the usually clean-shaven Steve Yzerman slowly become a bit scruffier, or the perpetually stubbled Brendan Shanahan turn into a grizzly bear overnight.</p>
<p>The Tigers are noticeable lacking in the facial hair department, and it&#8217;s not (as far as I am aware) due to any Steinbrenner-esque rules (no visible tats, no facial hair, steroids and cheating okay). </p>
<p>Earlier in the season, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/04/12/in-which-i-have-had-it-up-to-here/">I bitched and moaned</a> about the Tigers not playing with any sense of urgency, and there seemingly being no clubhouse leader to smack their asses into line. </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I&#8217;ve been proven wrong.</p>
<p>Enter Alex Avila.</p>
<p>When he was called up at the end of the 2009 season, Alex was money. </p>
<p>In 61 at-bats, Alex launched 5 homeruns, batted .279 and walked ten times. His slugging percentage, on-base percentage and OPS were impressive too: .375/.590/.965, respectively.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Avila was only 22 at the time.</p>
<p>Since then, he has called Armando Galarraga&#8217;s (near) perfect game and, this weekend, Justin Verlander&#8217;s second career no-hitter. </p>
<p>His stats are impressive, but more so, he&#8217;s starting to remind me of Big Wheel&mdash;Lance Parrish, so named because he was the big wheel in the Tiger&#8217;s championship machine.</p>
<p>What makes Avila, at the tender age of 24, the second coming of Lance?</p>
<p>Check out his new facial hair. While he&#8217;s always had the perpetual 5 o&#8217;clock shadow,<a href="http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/2/275353219001/275353219001_922924438001_vs-922920433001.jpg?pubId=275353219001" target="_blank"> he&#8217;s now sporting a rather counter-trendy goatee</a>.</p>
<p>Then, he said this: We&#8217;re too good to be playing like this.</p>
<p>Mind you, he&#8217;s right, and mind you, no one else bothered to say it. Calling your teammates out to the press? That&#8217;s what a leader, or a douchebag, does. How do you know which Alex is?</p>
<p><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=14417199&amp;tcid=fb_det_14417199&amp;c_id=det" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s check the video evidence.</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Kid takes Andruw Jones out at the plate. He sets up for a collision and DOES. NOT. BUDGE. </p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? Is that the sound of Avila putting his money where his mouth is?</p>
<p>Yes. And you&#8217;ll notice the Tigers have been a different team lately. A team with a leader, who is only 24 years old&mdash;a lot like someone else who grew an okay beard every now and then. Stevie Y, anyone?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, my Monday team, the MIRS Muckrakers, played like the Detroit Tigers.</p>
<p>By that I mean the Detroit Tigers of the Alan Trammell era&mdash;the Alan-as-manager era, when I just wanted to hug (and gently smack) him when he would lament, post-game, “We just had that one bad inning.”</p>
<p>For us, it was the first inning. We were up to bat first and promptly went down in order; I, at the #2 spot, hitting the first pitch and not, as my coach would say, using my lower half. (I’d have the same problem during at bat #2, but AB #3 was much better&mdash;to the tune of a hit that felt about 60% right.)</p>
<p>Then, the defense.</p>
<p>Mind you, we were playing Team Hooah, which is the sound you make in the Army when something is awesome (“Hooah, motherfuckers, we just killed bin Laden!”), when you’re driving a point home, when you’re happy, sad, silly, etc. It’s a much more badass version of &#8220;smurf.&#8221; </p>
<p>So Team Hooah is good. They’re a National Guard team, and a few years back, we had to reschedule our late-season games with them because they were deploying. As you can imagine, we didn’t need to spot them any runs. We didn’t need to give them a hand. </p>
<p>But we did, to the tune of NINE RUNS in the first inning.  </p>
<p>As Alex Avila said of his own under-performing team, We are too good to play like this. (Some other day I’ll have a whole separate column on Alex, because there’s so much to love about him: his perpetual five o’clock shadow, the way he calls pitches without dugout help, how he called the perfect game and Armando didn’t shake him off, how he can be, finally, the leader the Tigers need.)</p>
<p>When we lost 19-9, I felt just like I felt watching the Tigers from 1989-2005, and 2007-present. We’re too good to play like this. But it’s only the first game of the season, right, and we’re all a bit rusty or nervous or whatever.</p>
<p>And, really, now that the news of bin Laden’s death has settled, I am feeling a little overcome with compassion for our armed forces, many of whom don’t get lazy evening ballgames or full seasons or even a cup of tea, the television and Monday night baseball on ESPN. </p>
<p>It kind of doesn’t feel right to bitch about my just-for-fun team booting balls and missing plays and dropping outs. (Lucky bastards. I was HOT after the game!)</p>
<p>I said “Thanks,” to every member of Team Hooah as they passed, because, fuck it, our one bad inning was better than any day in Baghdad or Kabul or even Ft. Sill, OK. I’ve got it pretty easy. I’m not fighting PTSD and nightmares and the horrible memories (and withdrawals of powerful adrenaline highs that can’t be replicated in normal life) of war. </p>
<p>I’m bitching because no one else seems to want to do what it takes to win as much as I do. Maybe I feel a little cosmically twinned with the military that way. So hey, nice game, Team Hooah. It was a privilege to have our asses kicked by men and women of honor.</p>
