										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Sometimes to even live is an act of courage.<br />
&#8212; Seneca</p></blockquote>
<p>The survival instinct is an interesting one. In the most extreme of circumstances &#8212; that is, in its purest form &#8212; it is without logic. It is animal. Survive to survive, and for no other reason. In Joe Carnahan’s <em>The Grey</em>, seven men are tested. Their circumstances are most certainly extreme, and along the way a few of these men opt out on their own terms. Most are not so lucky. One is not so resigned.</p>
<p>When we first see Ottway (played with a quiet intensity that can only describe as &#8220;Neeson-esque&#8221; by one, Mr. Liam Neeson) he has a gun in his mouth. The look in his eye implies that his mind and body are not operating within the same space. He is thinking of his wife. She tells him not to be afraid. Later, surrounded by the sounds of growling wolves, he tells one of his fellow plane crash survivors that they’d be a fool not to be afraid. But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="The Grey poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/topwalls.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/The-Grey-movie-600x767.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="460" /> Ottway works at a remote oil outpost with a decent-sized group of men and women he describes as being “unfit” for society. His job is to protect these people by keeping the wolves surrounding the area at bay, perched atop a building with no company other than his sniper rifle. Left alone with his thoughts, he seems to suffer from the kind of internalized social bluntness that comes with that sort of job, an outcast amongst outcasts. None of that matters when the plane goes down.</p>
<p>Soon, the seven survivors find their scheduled leave promptly unscheduled as they awaken in a snow-covered haze. It is here in the wild, cold and hopeless, that Ottway springs into action. First, he guides a man towards death. He tells him “not to be afraid.” He tells him to “let it wash over him.” He describes the process as though he’s been there before. He then moves on to surveying their surroundings. It turns out that they’re full of hungry, aggressive wolves. As if matters needed to be made worse?</p>
<p>The men follow him because he seems to know what he’s doing, and he does, if only to a certain degree. He is familiar with wolf behavior, but mostly in theory. Besides, it is not his wolf expertise that makes him the <em>de facto</em> leader; it is his relentless desire to survive. And while the men cling to home and the things that they stand to lose, Ottway seems to want to survive only to prove to himself that he can.</p>
<p>The group is inevitably thinned. One by one they go, victims of the weather, the wolves and their own hopelessness. Along the way we learn just enough about them to feel sad about it, but not enough to linger for too long.</p>
<p>Then, there is the matter of the wolves.</p>
<p>Sometimes they look good, sometimes not so much. They are mostly, if not all, CG. An interesting choice, especially in context of the primary complaint that I’ve seen lodged against this film: The wolves do not behave like real wolves. Perhaps they are not supposed to? Maybe they are not meant to be “real” wolves? Maybe they are merely the cold, unrelenting representation of nature’s indifference? Maybe it was just cheaper to use CG wolves? Either way, they are most effective when growling just off-camera, their eyes glowing hungrily in the dark. And Carnahan is wise to frame many shots with just enough negative space to make us think that at any moment it could be occupied by one of the leaping, ravenous beasts. We have been trained by monster movies.</p>
<p>In the end it is Ottway, alone. No surprise. Early on in the film he insists that the men gather the wallets of the fallen for the families, like dog tags. Now, sitting on the forest floor he removes them from his backpack, one by one, and stacks them nearly on top of each other. He remembers his wife lying in a hospital bed. “Don’t be afraid.” He remembers a poem his father had framed in his childhood home:</p>
<blockquote><p> Once more into the fray, into the last fight I’ll ever know. Live or die on this day. Live or die on this day.</p></blockquote>
<p>As he glances around him and sees the piles of antlers and various bones he realizes that he has wandered into the wolves&#8217; den. The alpha wolf walks towards him. He gathers himself up, straps weapons to his hands, and lunges forward. Some will be frustrated by the black screen that follows that moment. Others will not. There is a short scene after the credits have finished rolling that may or may not provide satisfaction. For me, it’s completely unnecessary because one can only fight for so long, and the fight is the whole point.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Young Adult poster" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.onlinemovieshut.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/young-adult-poster.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="514" /> Director Jason Reitman (Son of Ivan Reitman, a pretty well known director himself) has made some of the most easily digestible, yet incredibly smart films of the past few years. He has an impressive level of discernment when choosing projects and a penchant for protagonists who are hard to like but impossible to resist. His first film, <em>Thank You for Smoking</em> (2005), is about a big tobacco spokesman who spends as much time lying and spinning as he does trying to be a good father to his twelve year old boy. True, everybody in <em>Juno</em> (2007) is pretty damned likable, but 2009’s <em>Up in the Air</em> features a protagonist who has spent so much time travelling that he’s lost the ability to connect with anyone. Also, he fires people for a living, so there’s that. And now we have <em>Young Adult</em> (2011), which features an alcoholic young adult book ghost writer desperately clinging to her high school glory days and teetering on the brink of insanity.</p>
<p>Written by <em>Juno</em> writer Diablo Cody, <em>Young Adult</em> is just as clever but far less self aware. It doesn’t try so hard. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) has. . . hang ups, we’ll call them, but they&#8217;re introduced with great simplicity and subtlety. For instance, when she receives an email announcing the birth of her former high school beau’s first child, she does not “freak out.” Not in the traditional sense, at least. Instead, she simply prints it out and spends large chunks of time staring at it (<em>totally</em> not freaking out)!</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Mavis is clearly an alcoholic. But we don’t get the obligatory drunken stumbling, slurred speech and rows of liquor bottles. We do see Mavis wake up every morning face down on her bed, on top of the covers. She doesn’t appear to drink at home, but when she goes out she always seems to have just a few too many. Always. It’s the kind of drinking habit that might get your friends whispering behind your back, if you had any. It’s definitely the kind that sneaks up on you.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mavis comes to the conclusion that things have not shaken down for her the way they should have and that something absolutely must be done about it. Her job as a ghost writer for a popular young adult series isn’t quite as glamorous as being the actual author, and her lonely, one-bedroom apartment could be bigger. And why didn’t <em>her</em> marriage work out?! She’s awfully pretty, after all. Perhaps if she had married Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), her high school sweetheart, everything would have been different. There’s only one way to find out, and soon we find Mavis on a road trip back to her home town blaring a mix-tape Buddy had made for her on infinite loop. Mavis to the rescue.</p>
<p>It turns out that not much has changed ‘round these parts. She pretends to be disgusted by it, but everyone seems so happy. Are they just too stupid to know that they’re miserable? Too simple? At the local bar she bumps into Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt), whom she doesn’t really remember &#8212; despite having had a locker right next to him in high school &#8212; until he mentions getting beaten near to death by a group of bullies who thought that he was gay. “You’re the hate crime guy!” You’d be hard pressed to find a guy as patient as Matt.</p>
<p>Mavis reveals her plan to him (after a few drinks, of course): Convince Buddy that he’s miserable and sweep him off to Minneapolis with her to start a new life together. Never mind that he’s already married and celebrating the birth of his first child. To Mavis, these things are mere stumbling blocks. Besides, babies are “boring.” Matt does not approve, but you get the impression that he’s not ungrateful for having been invited to the shenanigans, which I shall not spoil for you.</p>
<p>Charlize Theron’s performance is fantastic. It’s not as showy as her transformation in <em>Monster</em> (2003), but it is more nuanced. Patton Oswalt is proving himself to be a pretty interesting character actor (see <em>Big Fan</em> 2009 if you think his performance came out of left field), and Patrick Wilson is pitch-perfect as well. It’s such a shame that this film came and went without much notice. It was originally marketed as a comedy, which it is not. Most of the film&#8217;s laugh out loud lines are presented in the trailer. That’s not as to say that it isn’t funny, it’s just not broad comedy funny. It’s funny because it’s sad, because it’s true. Mavis may sound like a total nightmare and that’s because she is, but there’s an important scene towards the end of the film where she visits her parents and we get a glimpse of the reasons why. Her parents still have a picture of Mavis and her ex-husband on their wall. Her father remembers him as being a “nice guy.” Her mother concurs, adding that it is a “nice” memory. When Mavis announces that she thinks that she might be an alcoholic, they laugh it off. She’s just being dramatic. Isn’t that nice?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have I mentioned that there are too many Best Picture nominees? <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/01/28/the-great-oscar-race-begins/">Has that come up before</a>? I digress. Once again find myself a few movies shy of the full category. And although I did manage to sneak <em>The Help</em> in at the buzzer &#8211; too late for an article &#8211; I was unable to get to<em> Hugo</em>, <em>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</em> (Does having read the book count? And how about if I didn’t like it?) and <em>Warhorse</em>. <em>C&#8217;est la vie</em>.</p>
<p>I had convinced myself pretty early on that this was a bit of a down year. Having seen most of the films now I think that that was an unfair assessment. A few words that come to mind now are charming, insightful, sweet, and nostalgic. This may not have been a “down” year, <em>per se</em>, but it was certainly a pretty mellow one. It should also be noted that these are words one might use to describe a grandparent.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img title="The Artist" src="https://i2.wp.com/cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/TheArtistSq.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>The Artist</em> wins Best Picture 2012</p></div>
<p>This year’s award show came and went without many surprises.  Out of the films that I did manage to get to I could make a pretty solid argument for at least three of them winning Best Picture, <em>The Artist</em> being one of them. I wouldn’t have minded <em>The Descendants</em> taking it, but I feel like it was too humble to stand out, and <em>The Tree of Life</em> could’ve taken it on sheer scale alone (It’s a film about EVERYTHING!).</p>
<p>All told, I’m happy with most of the victors. It does seem to be a real shame that Viola Davis didn’t take home Best Actress, but she’ll get hers one day. Meryl Streep is certainly one of the best of our time, but I’ve not heard a great many good things about <em>The Iron Lady</em>, and historically speaking acting awards tend to go to great performances in great (or at least very good) films. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/23/147291130/most-oscar-voters-are-white-male-out-of-touch">Perhaps not being entirely on the Academy’s radar demographic-wise</a> hurt Viola a little bit?</p>
<p>And where was the Best Supporting nomination for Albert Brooks in <em>Drive</em>?! Aside from that film being one of my favorites of the year, Brook’s villainy is pretty epic in it and I’m reasonably certain no one would have missed Nick Nolte’s name on that list. He’s very good in <em>Warrior</em>, but let’s face it; he’s played that character before.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest travesty for me, though, was the fact that <em>The Tree of Life’s</em> cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, didn’t go home with the gold. Yes, <em>Hugo</em> looks amazing, but I have never seen a film that looks or feels anything like <em>The Tree of Life</em>. Never. I don’t know about you, but I can’t think of a better impetus for handing someone an award.</p>
<p>It’s funny, this year I didn’t find myself terribly concerned about missing the few Best Picture noms that I did. Would I have rather seen <em>Hugo</em> than <em>The Help</em> (my wife is largely responsible for that)? Absolutely. But do I feel that I’ve missed out on <em>Extremely Loud</em> and <em>Warhorse</em>? Not really. Which brings us full circle: Were their really nine films worthy of being considered Best Picture? Can anyone give me a solid reason why <em>Extremely Loud</em>, a film hovering just under 50% on rottentomatoes.com, was even mentioned in the same breath as some of these other films? Oh well, it’s all over and done with now. And I’m reasonably certain that I’ll have another opportunity to rail on about this again next year.</p>

<p>Its story is a sort of mash-up of <em>Singing in the rain</em> (1952) and <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> (1950) &#8212; the first being a film about the inception of the “talkie” and a young starlet who makes it big because she has a better voice than the current big name (a less squeaky one, at least), and the latter being about a washed-up silent film star left behind by her former industry to go mad in solitude. Admittedly, <em>The Artist</em> functions much better when it’s closer to the former, but the winks help with the latter.</p>
<p>These “winks” that I keep mentioning mostly come in the form of melodrama, especially towards the end, which gets to be a bit. . . much. But there are also a few clever uses of sound here and there. Hearing Jean Dujardin’s thick, French accent at the film&#8217;s end is especially fun.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dujardin, the casting is phenomenal. None of the actors, even the highly recognizable ones (John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, James Cromwell), feel out of place. But man, does Dujardin look at home in black and white! Roger Ebert described him as a cross between Sean Connery and Gene Kelly, which is pretty apropos. Berenice Bejo as the plucky young Peppy Miller doesn’t do half bad herself, with her winning smile and perfectly placed (by Dujardin, in fact) beauty mark.</p>
<p>So the order for the day here seems to be charm. There isn’t a second of <em>The Artist</em> that isn’t charming in one way or another. But can a film win a Best Picture Oscar on charm alone?</p>
<p><strong>The Artist<em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin), Best Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo), Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Costume Design, Best Directing, Best Editing, Music (original score) &amp; Best original Screenplay</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><img class="alignright" title="Moneyball poster" src="https://i0.wp.com/collider.com/wp-content/uploads/moneyball-poster.jpg" alt="" width="261" height="386" />“It’s hard not to be romantic about baseball”<br />
&#8212; Billy Beane</p></blockquote>
<p>Many great things have been said about the game of baseball (and a few silly things, too &#8212; Just Google Yogi Berra), but the above quote wraps it all up nicely and puts a bow on top. I would argue that you’d be hard-pressed to find a sport where even a regular season game, especially one early in the season, could hold as much drama as baseball. Bennett Miller’s <em>Moneyball</em> opens with a playoff loss and closes with one, but it focuses on a record-setting winning streak during the Oakland A’s 2002 regular season.</p>
<p>Beane, played by Brad Pitt, attributes the season’s winning ways to a team-building system devised by a night watchman at a pork and beans cannery named Bill James, now an advisor for the Boston Red Sox. James’ theory is that you choose players based on specific skill sets regardless of their perceived worth and overall talent. Beane is introduced to this system by a young Yale grad named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill).</p>
<p>Of course everyone thinks that Beane’s lost his. . . beans. But the wins begin to pile up, and you can’t argue with wins. Well, I suppose you can. Even Beane states that he won’t be truly satisfied until they’ve won it all. Even then he’d probably just want to do it again.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time with Billy Beane off the field, which is easy because we’re told that superstition prevents him from watching the games on television, let alone live. He is a doting father and an honest, hard-working guy who doesn’t take himself too seriously. I was thoroughly impressed by how well Pitt was able to disappear into the character and contribute to Beane&#8217;s high level of likeability. If you had asked me beforehand whether or not I would expect a potential award-winning performance from him I would have said no, but there it is.</p>
<p><em>Moneyball</em> is cleverly written (<em>The Social Network</em> writer Aaron Sorkin was involved, after all), well-directed and perfectly acted. The only real question is whether or not it is too quiet to stand out in the crowd. Well, if the montage of Oakland’s 20-win streak doesn’t get them, then I just don’t know what would have.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moneyball</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brad Pitt), Best Supporting Actor (Jonah Hill), Film editing, Sound Mixing &amp; Best Adapted Screenplay</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em><img class="alignright" title="Midnight in Paris poster" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/midnight-in-paris.jpg?w=229&#038;h=329" alt="" width="229" height="329" />If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a movable feast</em><br />
&#8212; Ernest Hemingway</p></blockquote>
<p>I have been lucky enough to have visited Paris twice in my life (so far) &#8212; once on a back-backing trip and once on my honeymoon. It is an easy city to be romantic in, but it’s even easier to be romantic about, and Woody Allen’s latest film, <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, is an hour-and-a-half love letter to the city, art, literature and creativity itself.</p>
<p>There is always a “Woody Allen character” in Woody Allen films, and this go-round his name is Gil and he’s played by Owen Wilson, displaying a kind of youthful exuberance I haven’t seen from Wilson since <em>Bottle Rocket</em> (1996). He’s travelled to Paris with his wife-to-be (Rachel McAdams) and future in-laws on a business trip, and this is not his first visit. No matter how hard he tries, he simply cannot get anyone to comprehend the beauty and amazement he sees all around him in the city of lights. They are more interested in stuffy dinners and shopping. His wife seems to be more interested in spending time with the laughably pretentious Paul (Michael Sheen), a family “friend.”</p>
<p>Gil often finds himself wandering the streets alone, which I’m sure he prefers. One night, unable to find his way back to his hotel, Gil is picked up by a mysterious cab full of revelers on their way to a party. Two of the revelers turn out to be F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda. It isn’t long before Gil, an aspiring novelist, is hanging with the likes of Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Pablo Picasso. Allen makes little effort to explain this flight of fancy, and the film is better for it. One evening, while chilling at Gertrude Stein’s home, Gil meets Adriana, a mistress of Pablo Picasso’s. They immediately hit it off and, in finding real romance, Gil begins to question himself and his life choices.</p>
<p>But enough about that.</p>
<p>This movie is really about Paris and the romance it inspires, and in that regard it is hugely successful. If this film doesn’t make you want to pack your bags then I’ve got nothing for you. Its literary and film references are clever (the gag where Gil suggests that Luis Bunuel make a film about a bunch of bourgeoisie people having dinner together and then finding that they can’t leave the room is a personal fav), but not so esoteric as to lose everybody, and the jazz soundtrack really seals the deal. A beautiful film set in a beautiful city. Will that be enough?</p>
<p><strong><em>Midnight in Paris</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best original Screenplay &amp; Best Art Direction</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="The Tree of Life poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/collider.com/wp-content/uploads/the_tree_of_life_movie_poster_01.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="336" />Terrence Malick’s <em>The Tree of Life</em> is a difficult film. It speculates, but does not clearly state. It admires a mother’s warm smile, the smallness of a newborn in its father’s arms, and the cosmic ballet of the universe as one in the same. In short, it is a film about everything, and it is just as grand in scale as you’d expect such a film to be. But the grandiose is presented only as context for the intimate, the little things that shape us, and that’s what makes this a Best Picture nominee.</p>
<p>I’ll admit to initially being turned off a bit by the aforementioned cosmic ballet, the birth of life, the dinosaurs (yes, there are dinosaurs). It all seems a bit much. But when the film began to settle on the O’Brien family, circa 1950, it all started to fall into place. Everything about this family &#8212; the film’s center &#8212; feels stunningly authentic and lovingly rendered. Sunlight poring in through windows, glasses of lemonade served in plastic cups with flowers on them.</p>
<p>We learn a great deal about this family with very little dialogue. We learn that the family has lost a son. We learn that the eldest of the remaining two boys (played as an adult by Sean Penn) resents his father’s affection towards his younger brother. Sometimes the father (Brad Pitt) is a little hard on the boys. His wife (Jessica Chastain) is warm and forgiving.</p>
<p>A great deal of time is spent with the boys running, jumping, and skinning their knees. It’s enough to make anyone who grew up in a middle- to lower-middle-class suburban family wistful. They make mistakes and learn things about themselves. They mature. The film is filled with whispered narration, “Mother, Father. Always you wrestle inside me. Always you will.”</p>
<p>Malick marvels at the world around him and how everything means everything (or nothing at all). He senses a bigger picture, but it’s too grand to put a finger on. There is a certain level of spirituality in the film&#8217;s final moments, Sean Penn surrounded by those he knew and loved on a beach, a white door leading to. . . somewhere. But one could certainly go the other way with it, acknowledging that we are the sum total of those who have touched us along the way.</p>
<p><em>The Tree of Life</em> might be too big and too difficult to win it all this year. Or perhaps that’s precisely why it could? I suppose it all depends on whether or not the Academy is willing to reward a film for attempting to reach so far even if it can’t always grasp anything?</p>
<p><strong><em>The Tree of Life</em> is nominated for Best Picture, Cinematography &amp; Directing</strong></p>

To most of us, it’s not a place where people live and certainly not where anyone dies. My wife even remarked during the opening minutes of Alexander Payne’s <em>The Descendants</em> that it was strange to see office buildings through Matt King’s (George Clooney) own office window. “I didn’t know they had those there!” This, surely, cannot be Hawaii? But it is, and people do die there.</p>
<p>Matt King is, as a matter of fact, waiting for his wife to die after she has slipped into a coma caused by a jet skiing head injury. He has been told that there is nothing anyone can do now. His job is to tell everyone else, starting with his two daughters. The youngest, Scottie (Amara Miller), is already acting out in school, and her older sister Alex (Shailene Woodley) seems to have been her mentor. To make matters worse, Matt’s family has been locked in a fierce debate about how best to unload a plot of land handed down to them by their royal Hawaiian ancestors, and he gets to make the final call. Did I mention that <em>The Descendants</em> is also funny? It is. Not laugh out loud funny, no, but it does contain the kind of humor one uses to relieve impossible stress. In short, it is always funny right when it needs to be.</p>
<p>Like when Alex drops a bombshell on Matt’s bombshell, informing him that the reason she and her mother had not been speaking before the accident was because Alex had discovered her mother was having an affair. Okay, that’s not so funny. But the sight of Matt slipping on his man-dals and running down the street to confront his wife’s best friend about the affair sure is. He gets the other man’s name and the subsequent search provides a fine opportunity for Alex and Matt to bond. (Teenage girls love drama, don’t they?)</p>
<p>There are some nice moments involving peripheral characters. Matt’s father-in-law, for example, uses his daughter&#8217;s impending death as an excuse to unload all of the disappointing thoughts he has ever had about his son-in-law. And when his wife’s lover&#8217;s wife (wha?) shows up at the hospital Matt is sympathetic. None of this is really about him anyway. The only real fly in the ointment is a friend Alex drags along for the trip. Sure, they explain his presence well enough, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that the film wouldn&#8217;t have missed him.</p>
<p>And what of Matt’s struggle over his family’s decision to unload their land? Land that, in his own words, they did “nothing to earn?” It appears to comes not only from his desire to save a place he has enjoyed with his own immediate family, but from a deep respect for his family’s history. They say that death is for the living. They say that it can put things into perspective. I think that Matt and his daughters would most certainly agree.</p>

<p><em>Hanna</em> (2011) begins and ends with that line, but it doesn’t feel the same way the second time. When Hanna first utters it she is standing over a deer she has just hit with an arrow.  Its breathing is panicked and frightened. She quickly (and somewhat coldly) puts it out of its misery. This is what must be done. When she says it again the film has given it more context, but we’ll get to that.</p>
<p><em>Hanna</em> is, first and foremost, a phenomenal action film. Its shots, editing, pacing and soundtrack (provided by The Chemical Brothers) are all impeccable. It is, in fact, one of the best action films I have seen in recent memory. All of that is enough, but what pushes it past being a really good film and into being a great one are its regular flirtations with other genres and how deftly director Joe Wright moves between them.</p>
<div style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Hanna and Erik" src="https://i1.wp.com/aka.media.entertainment.sky.com/image/unscaled/2011/01/07/Hanna-3-4.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="326" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Father knows best</p></div>
<p>Shortly after slaying the deer, Hanna is informed that she is dead by a man standing behind her. She doth protest, and after much struggling and repeated attempts to reach a gun, we learn that this man is Erik, Hanna’s father. Well, sort of. Either way, he teaches her to read and speak multiple languages. He reads her stories. But most importantly he teaches her to kill, and she’s a quick study. There is clearly a level of affection between the two of them, but Erik keeps Hanna at a distance. It seems as though he feels that it’s easier for her that way. It’s certainly easier for him.</p>
<p>Inside their remote cabin there is a red button attached to a homing beacon. Erik has informed Hanna that when she is ready she may push that button and that “she” will come for her. This woman will not stop until either Hanna is dead, or she is. Her name is Marisa Wiegler, the woman Hanna has been training to kill her whole life. She pushes the button.</p>
<p>Hanna is captured with ease, playing the role of the lost, confused little girl. She is brought to a military facility, the kind that is always located in the middle of nowhere and decorated almost entirely with sheet metal. You know the place. There she is questioned by a psychologist and, soon, a Marissa Wiegler double. You didn’t think that she’d go in there alone, did you?! No, unlike the rest of this outfit, Miss Wiegler knows what she’s dealing with. It is confirmed when Hanna quickly snaps the neck of the double and the real deal can’t help but betray an excited smile. She has been waiting for this all of Hanna’s life, too.</p>
<p>And so our action film is set in motion. Hanna goes on the run, attempting to meet up with her father at “Grimm’s house,” with Wiegler and her goons (Headed by a man named Isaacs, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Be1_6rqKMM">played with exquisite creepiness by Tom Hollander</a>) in hot pursuit.</p>
<div style="width: 572px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="  " title="Hanna with a gun" src="https://i2.wp.com/cf1.imgobject.com/backdrops/600/4d7f611e7b9aa11a0c01b600/hanna-poster.jpg" alt="" width="562" height="316" /><p class="wp-caption-text">I am what I am</p></div>
<p>Eventually Hanna comes into contact with a vacationing British family. She befriends the daughter and becomes the object of the little boy’s crush. The parents, both kind and welcoming, if not more than a bit concerned, are relatively clueless. Hanna seems to be surrounded by adults who don’t really know what to do with her. She goes on a date. She “hangs out.” She does none of these things naturally. There is only one thing that isn’t entirely foreign to her and her new friend learns this when she witnesses Hanna kill a man with ease right in front of her. Hanna sees what it’s like to be a teenage girl, but will always be on the outside looking in.</p>
<p>Then there is Marissa. We learn a few things as the film goes along. We learn that Marissa is chasing Erik and Hanna because the three of them are a part of government program involving the development of super soldiers. (Governments in film are absolutely OBSESSED with super soldiers!) Erik had misgivings about the program and attempted to escape with Hanna and her biological mother. Hanna’s mother did not make it. That bit of business is none of Marissa’s concern as she knows who Hanna really belongs to anyway.</p>
<p>Marissa doesn’t betray much emotion, but when she does we get the feeling that her entire life is a struggle to contain it. She views it as a weakness. There is a scene in which Erik has shown up at her hotel desperate to end things and has Marissa hiding behind her bed as he shoots through the door. She commands herself, out loud, to get up and go. No one tells Marissa Wiegler what to do but Marissa Wiegler.</p>
<p>Hanna eventually arrives at “Grimm’s house,” which turns out to be an abandoned amusement park occupied by one of Erik’s contacts. Kneplfer, an older gentleman, treats Hanna like a grandchild. He feeds her and entertains her. There are hints that he once had great affection for Erik and her mother; a life that could have been. Soon Marissa and Isaacs arrive.</p>
<p>Hanna and her father have an important scene together shortly before Marissa kills him. After Hanna has run from “Grimm’s house” and found her father, he attempts to justify himself. He tells her that he had no choice. He tells her that he had to prepare her for what was coming. She learns that they are not related by blood and that that never mattered to him. He only wanted to protect her. Hanna has been failed by all of the adults around her.</p>
<p>When Hanna and Marissa have their inevitable showdown Hanna tells her that she doesn’t want to hurt anyone anymore. Marissa promptly shoots her, but not before Hanna lands an arrow in her chest. As Marissa lies bleeding on the ground Hanna stands over her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Trollhunter poster" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogamole.tr3s.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/troll_hunter_poster.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="325" />I clearly haven’t been paying enough attention to U-verse’s On Demand feature, because it turns out that they’ve been offering advanced rentals of movies not yet in theatres for some time now. What kind of cinephile am I? Since this discovery I have been known to occasionally shut off my Netflix streaming (only occasionally) and scope out what’s available. The first “not yet available” rental I made was <em>Vanishing on 7<sup>th</sup> Street</em> (2010), an unfortunate misstep by the talented genre filmmaker, Brad Anderson, which was shot in Detroit. So yeah, not a great start.</p>
<p>I fared slightly better with the Norwegian mokumentary, <em>Trollhunter</em> (2010), which tells the story of Hans, who has the thankless job of ridding Norway’s scenic countryside of roaming trolls. If that sounds ridiculous, that’s because it is. I’m pretty sure that ridiculous was exactly what the filmmakers were going for. It’s just not quite ridiculous enough.</p>
<p>Using the somewhat tiresome “found footage” concept as its launching point, we are soon following a trio of documentary filmmakers investigating a mysterious rash of bear-related attacks. The bears are always found on site, shot by a hunter with its tongue hanging hilariously out of its mouth. The crew soon tracks down said hunter, a man named Hans, whose jeep is covered in claw marks and is understandably stand-offish about it.</p>
<p>Relentlessly dogged by the crew, Hans relents and tells them that the perpetrators of those bear attacks are actually trolls and that he was hired by a government agency called the T.S.S. (The Troll Security Service, or something like that) to coral the ones that wander off their established territories. Sounds like a scenario ripe for some political commentary, no? Hans does briefly (very briefly) lament having to go into troll territory and murder pregnant females and children along with their male counterparts, but then he’s off to kill another troll, so it’s obviously not keeping him up at night. I suppose a film called <em>Trollhunter</em> doesn’t have much room, nor need for political commentary. Fair enough. Anyway, the real reason we’re here is the trolls, and you know what? They look great.</p>
<p>There is some seriously effective CG on display here, with each troll looking very different and moving in a kind of herky-jerky throwback to stop motion animation, a welcome detail. They are all pretty traditional looking (big, phallic noses, hunched backs, etc.) as the movie makes a point of referencing folk tales repeatedly as a source of truths. Trolls, for example, obsessively hunt Christians by smell. Fee-fi-fo-fum. They also eat rocks and turn to stone when exposed to sunlight (or Hans’ handy UV gun). There’s some murky scientific explanation for that, but you can chalk it all up to a vitamin D deficiency, and if that isn’t good enough for you then I don’t know what to tell ya’.</p>
<p>We learn that there are several species of trolls, all leading up to an encounter with the mountain variety, whose feet are approximately the same size as Hans’ jeep. It’s quite a sight, especially when Hans is trying to navigate his speeding jeep around the troll as it lumbers down a mountain road, but the final battle is somewhat anti-climactic. In fact, the only truly satisfying troll encounter comes when Hans ties a few sheep to the rail of a bridge as bait then, attacks the baited troll wearing what looks like a wrought iron replica of the armor worn by the knights who say, “ni.”</p>
<p>Look, the truth is that all of this either sounds appealing to you or it doesn’t. I just have a feeling that those who do find it appealing will probably be a little bit let down. The <a href="http://youtu.be/TLEo7H9tqSM">trailer</a>, which captures a better overall absurdist tone than the film itself, had me convinced that this was going to be a great, over the top romp. It turned out that the cast and crew took things a bit too seriously. Even a troll fart joke falls flat, and if you can’t swing a fart joke, then I don’t know what to tell ya’.</p>
