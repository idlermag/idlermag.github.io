										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last several months I have been patiently seated in om position on a lofty pedestal of standards and expectations, under the impression that I was acting as a receptor for messages from the universe. Messages about romantic harmony and tolerance and a number of other virtues that catastrophe had tricked me into caring about. Don’t worry, this was temporary. When I fell out of the trance, I landed squarely on my ass.</p>
<p>Tonight I found myself on the couch, drinking beer and eating hot dogs out of the package. I was thinking about the Illuminati and how I knew absolutely nothing about them, and my god did they really exist and when did they originate, and what did they actually do, anyways? The library was closed, but there was Google. It was suddenly imperative to initiate a search and dive headlong into a rabbit hole of fascinating, disjointed information about secret societies. I had a date at 9 pm. At 9:15 pm I am still in my underwear, having melted into a conglomerate of smudged mascara and a bonnet of frizz. I blame humidity and enthusiasm. My phone was on silent so I didn’t see all of those confirmation texts or receive that exasperated voicemail until a few moments ago. Oopsie.</p>
<p>During times of great personal crisis, I tend to retreat into a state of social hibernation. And I have been in a state of lock-down panic. </p>
<p>It goes a little like this: adulthood.</p>
<p>No, wait. It’s worse than that: attempting to date like an adult.</p>
<p>Dating that involves guarded but bubbly conversation over moderately-priced meals. Dating without getting shit hell drunk and just falling madly in bed together. Dating aimed at more than taking care of your basic needs and then hoping to god the person doesn’t Facebook stalk you or suggest brunch. Dating that might prevent you from going home to silence and green tea and the luxury of never having to acknowledge that the person you’re fucking does things like take a dump or think it’s ok to put leftover onions and tomatoes in the same plastic baggie.</p>
<p>After about 5 years of long-distance casual sex with a guy I involuntarily fell in love with, I thought I’d had my come-to-Jesus moment of enlightenment. Arrangements like this one tend to fall apart. And this exploded instead of offering up peaceful disintegration. I lost a best friend and a good lay because for the first time in my life, my heart got the best of me. I thought – this is it, Teal – the universe is calling upon you to step up and represent the fairer sex as a lady, not a well-intentioned delinquent. You’ve finally grown out of this exhausting, nonsensical dance around commitment.</p>
<p>There was this moment of exuberance where I was optimistic about transforming into a woman who didn’t feel like she was caught in the teeth of a bear trap whenever she took on the role of little spoon. A sweaty, snoring bear trap, with a boner lodged in the small of her back when all she wanted to do was sleep. I thought hey, I could learn to like that. I could learn to make that dinner. I saw the light, and I danced right toward it.</p>
<p>I felt empowered and sure of what I wanted. I took a vow of self-imposed celibacy and waited for it to start making sense to me that all of my closest friends are in legally recognized long-term relationships. After all, I respect these people and their decisions, and I even really like their spouses. Try as I might, I couldn’t find a single cell in my rotten heart that could personally relate to this inclination.</p>
<p>Yet I kept waking up in my trademark starfish position, smack dab in the center of my heavenly nest of a bed, to discover that I could turn the light on at 4 am and read without anyone grumbling in annoyance, asking what the fuck time it was and would I not just go the fuck to sleep? I’m at my best from dusk to dawn, when everyone else is resting and I can putter unhindered through ill-conceived art projects or think in circles about abstract intellectual things without being asked distracting questions. I have found that cake tastes the best leftover and refrigerated, eaten in the dark with a glass of milk. That Van Morrison is especially moving when there is no one watching you sashay like you imagine a gypsy would move while you listen to it. I consider these important discoveries in the confines of my happy little life. And I’m just discovering that I might like them best undisturbed and unexamined by affectionate tourists.</p>
<p>My attempts at making nice with strangers while carefully evaluating whether or not I want to see them naked on a regular basis have failed miserably. I was doing really well until my vagina started to make these insane demands of me. And then I realized &#8211; I know in seconds whether or not I want to sleep with someone. But you start actually talking to them, and holy hell they don’t waste a second before spewing information that undermines whatever aesthetic value they possess. It’s like watching a time lapse of a chipping fresco. He ends sentences with prepositions and then volunteers that his reading is limited to Harry Potter and suddenly that entire, beautiful left bicep is no longer even visible.</p>
<p>An escalating series of these failed social experiences has led me to a new personal philosophy. My romantic fantasy is so simple that it’s impossible. It’s built on logic and reads more like a contractual agreement than a matter of the heart. In the past few weeks, I have synthesized these straightforward ground rules into a list I’ve started referring to as the Ten Commandments. Next week, I’m going to be generous and share them with you. But for now, I fucked my way into this mess and I suppose I can probably justify fucking my way back out of it, too. Cheers to pleasure and indulgence, my friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If one more person approaches me about my weight loss in the hushed whisper of a confidante seeking a dangerous voodoo secret, I may look them straight in the eye and in the same hushed tones, say, “Pain and misery you dumb fucker. Can’t you do simple math?”</p>
<p>Not too long ago, Kate Moss took a public slamming for revealing that one of her personal mottos was “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.” But Ms. Moss’s comment came after she had already lost a number of modeling contracts for being caught on video doing lines of cocaine. People reacted more violently to what was an opinion&mdash;a personal motto, than her documented drug use. To me it seemed like a completely valid motto, especially coming from a woman whose career is based on her appearance. Public denial that what we put into our bodies, and the amount of it, affects how we look, seems to be at an all-time high despite the continuing popularity of fad diets and quick fixes. And if you dare point this out in a way that lauds your own thinness in the faces of others, you had best be prepared for the backlash.</p>
<p>Over the past year and a half, I have lost just over 30 lbs. And more than 16 inches from my figure if you add up all of the various places I measure: waist, hips, bust, arms, thighs. It has been a long process, but one that is more difficult now that I am at a point where the results are undeniable and easy to notice. There is a new component to battle at this stage: peer pressure and public scrutiny. I’m not done with my journey. And suddenly it’s become everyone else’s journey, too. One they feel like they should have a say in directing or mediating.</p>
<p>In the break room a coworker told me that my legs looked a mile long. Then she told me that I was practically melting. At Easter a distant relative asked me if I had lost weight, and when I said “Yes, thank you!” she replied, “You were already beautiful. We don’t want you to waste away!” The negative connotations here do not express concern so much as they express criticism. This reaction is stronger when you refuse to apologize for the fact that you look and feel better about yourself, and happily accept a compliment rather than offering the standard self-deprecating joke or sheepish justification. It makes people visibly uncomfortable, and sometimes you can see them stammering to hold back the reassuring follow-up they already had prepared to coyly counter your readily volunteered self-criticism. </p>
<p>Making me uncomfortable about my new shape and size&mdash;pointing it out and commenting on it freely and publicly seems to fall into the realm of perfectly acceptable. Telling me that I already have a long face and that I run the risk of looking gaunt if I lose another pound is also fine. Telling someone that their face has morphed into their neck in one fantastic moon shape of excess fat is something you could not, however, get away with. Saying that you are worried about their heart or their cholesterol or the risk they run for diabetes by being overweight is also unacceptable. It is OK to shame someone for making healthy lifestyle changes, but when unhealthy habits are reflected by a person’s physique, mum’s the word in a culture hypersensitive to accepting everyone and not hurting anyone’s feeling. We are supposed to believe for the sake of social interactions that our weight is not something that we can control. If a woman is overweight, she is cursed with unfortunate genetics. Yet if a woman is thin, more often it is assumed that she has inflicted upon herself the joyless torment of a Nazi-esque diet and deprivation regiment than that she is blessed with impeccable genes. With the over-abundance of food and easy access to junk that we have, it may be true that resisting temptation has become a full-time job for those interested in being thing. Yet clearly none of these stereotypes are absolutes. It is equally as ignorant to assume that an overweight person who may have a medical condition is lazy as it is to mistake a thin person’s hard-earned svelteness for luck. Either way, Kate Moss got it a little wrong: nothing tastes as good as healthy feels. I never felt unattractive, or even fat. I’ve been blessed with a frame that carries weight evenly and dispenses it as curves. But I did feel uncomfortable in my own skin because I was completely out of shape, and because the behaviors that had led me to be carrying extra weight in the first place had negatively impacted my health.</p>
<p>Health isn’t about a quick-fix. It’s about sustainability. Health is part of your lifestyle if you’re serious about it. Few people want to address an all-encompassing lifestyle overhaul. And that is exactly what experience has shown me that it takes. Lifestyle isn’t just a personal change, either. It plays a huge part in your social choices and the people you choose to be around, as well as how they interact with you. It usually means you have to reconfigure your home environment, too.</p>
<p>I’ve been a serious athlete, a social binge drinker, a vegetarian, and an on-again, off-again chain smoker. I struggle terribly with emotional and stress-related bingeing and have since adolescence. Consequently, I have been a size 12 to a size 2 and everything in between, all since high school; well past the age of developing your lady bits. These inconsistencies not only showed in my waistline, they took a toll on my overall well-being. And none of these phases were sustainable. Realizing the latter is what finally broke the vicious cycle of indulgence and shameful repentance I had entered.</p>
<p>My biggest lifestyle change came when I decided to view food as fuel and sustenance. Losing weight might boost your confidence initially, but it is never a solution to any sort of personal issue. If you are an emotional or stress eater, you still have to find ways to deal with the feelings at the root of these impulses. Your body might change but you are still the same person. No dietary discipline is going to alter that&mdash;they are separate issues entirely. And I have a host of said “separate issues,” but I finally made a decision to leave my health and my body out of those battles.</p>
<p>It was a huge and liberating decision. Surprisingly easy and obvious to make mentally, and surprisingly difficult to enact physically. My kitchen cupboards had to be ransacked. I had to actually start doing dishes so that I wasn’t deterred from cooking. There was a tremendous amount of planning involved. Regular trips to the grocery store to make sure produce and meat were fresh and appetizing. Getting ingredients that could actually be combined into recipes and turned into meals, looking up new recipes to ensure variety and satisfaction. Along with it, I did an incredible amount of research to make sure that I was getting the proper nutrients and nourishing my body, not depriving myself. Quite frankly, it was a lot of work. And it took a lot of time for it to become a habit. But this was just the dietary component. The exercise and fitness half of the battle required a lot of scheduling accommodations to make it a priority, and an enjoyable one, too.</p>
<p>My faith in not only figuring this part of the balanced lifestyle out, but sustaining it, lies in the success of others that I know. One of those people, <a href="http://idler-mag.com/author/avasquezgiroux/">Angela Vasquez-Giroux</a>, is a mother and wife&mdash;a woman with much more personal responsibility than I, the petless, childless, date-avoiding young professional. She has been a sounding board to me throughout this lifestyle improvement process, and I thought sharing some of her insights here would be a great way to wrap up the article. She is, after all, a role model, and as you will see, a much more difficult one to brush off than Ms. Kate Moss.</p>
<p>&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>You’ve expressed that after making significant lifestyle changes for the sake of your health and general well-being, you have found yourself having to defend them to close friends and acquaintances alike. Can you describe such a situation and give me your thoughts on why this happens?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> I know we&#8217;ve talked a lot about people insinuating that there&#8217;s something wrong with losing weight – or that my size is shrinking because there&#8217;s something wrong with me, not because I am eating better and exercising, so I&#8217;ll let you cover that. Eating and exercise weren&#8217;t the only big changes I made.</p>
<p>In November, I stopped drinking. It was partly motivated by necessity – I take a daily medication that doesn&#8217;t interact well with booze. But the further away I&#8217;ve gotten from alcohol, and the entire associated culture – bars, binge drinking, hangovers, embarrassing behavior, hazy feelings of regret – the less I&#8217;ve missed it. </p>
<p>Now, when I am out and about with friends and alcohol is part of the evening, I have to decline – politely, of course. After reminding them that no, I am not pregnant, I&#8217;m just unable to drink, the standard response it, &#8220;That sucks.&#8221; </p>
<p>Perhaps I can avoid that by owning it a little more – because the truth is, I really don&#8217;t want to drink. I don&#8217;t miss it, and I especially don&#8217;t miss the way even one drink can derail healthy living – by blowing your calorie count on drinks (and then drunk food), by interfering with your workout routine, etc. </p>
<p>My life is less complicated and happier without booze, because I&#8217;m able to focus on eating and living clean. And my body shows it.</p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>Describe an average day for you: what would your food journal look like and what kind of exercise might you get?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> My goal every day is to eat a net 1250 calories&mdash;so, if I burn 300 calories running, my goal is then 1550, etc. </p>
<p>It cracks me up when people ask me if I am starving myself – because I am constantly eating! For dinner I will have a Larabar because I&#8217;m working late, and then I&#8217;ll have another snack when I get home after hitting the Y and my softball lesson. I always leave room for dessert, too, like pudding or ice cream.</p>
<p>I try to work out 5 or 6 days a week – either running 3 miles or hitting the cardio machines at the Y. I&#8217;m pretty busy, so I like shorter, intense sessions. I run on the elliptical for around 30 minutes – but I work hard, keeping my pace above 180 strides/min. Ditto with running. I want to be efficient with my workouts, because I don&#8217;t always have an hour to spend.</p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>As a mother, what is the example you want to set for your daughter in terms of both health and fitness? How much do you think your example will impact choices she makes as an adolescent, and later in life?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> I want to show my daughter that you can enjoy food, but that food is not meant to replace love&mdash;and for many people, it does, hence our obese nation. My husband and I try to set a positive example with our daughter by encouraging her to be active, and by being active ourselves. She knows that exercise is a priority for me, and she&#8217;ll accompany me on runs on her bike. She is also an athlete – in season, she swims a few nights a week, takes gymnastics, and is now playing soccer. </p>
<p>My hope is that she learns to take care of her body because she values what she can do with it, whether it&#8217;s a relaxing run to clear her mind or winning a swim meet. I try to emphasize health first: I measure my food and count calories to maintain my health, not to reach a goal dress size, and it&#8217;s my hope that she constructs her own relationship to food and exercise the same way.</p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>Did the attitude and behavior of your own mother toward food and exercise impact your views toward either?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> My mom has struggled with her weight her entire life, and she came from a family where food was synonymous with love. What I mean is that her family is very loving, but when every celebration or occasion is marked by a ritual of consuming mass quantities of unhealthy food, it teaches you to do the same in your own life, and I think that has made it harder for her. She and my dad are now losing weight and exercising, and it&#8217;s wonderful to see them take charge of their health. </p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>What do you think are some of the most common/biggest misconceptions about losing weight harbored by people? Why do you think they hold onto these beliefs when research is often readily accessible to dispel these myths?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> I often hear people say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not so bad for you.&#8221; As in, I&#8217;m ordering this dinner, and I am going to call it healthy even though it isn&#8217;t. Once you start tracking what is IN your food, and HOW MUCH of it you should be having, it&#8217;s appalling. I think so many people are in overt denial about what they&#8217;re eating, and how much, and why they&#8217;re getting heavier. What you eat makes you fat more than genetics. You do need to exercise. And you do need to be diligent about what, and how much, you&#8217;re eating. If you don&#8217;t want to do those things, then you don&#8217;t want to be healthy. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a lot of denial about what it takes to lose weight. It doesn&#8217;t take the Atkins diet, or home-delivered food. It takes discipline and a lifestyle change. I will eat this way for the rest of my life to maintain my weight loss&mdash;as opposed to these other diets, where the assumption is that after you drop 10 pounds you can go back to doing what you did before and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t. You have to change your life, and you have to commit to doing it forever. It&#8217;s the ONLY way. </p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>What motivates you on a daily basis to sustain your chosen lifestyle changes?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> I&#8217;m in the best shape of my life, and it shows. I don&#8217;t feel self-conscious about the way I look, or the way clothing fits. I can run and push myself and do things I never thought I was capable of. And it keeps me sane: the time when I am alone on the machines or running the trails, no one can bother me. For a mother, that&#8217;s golden time. For a human, you need it. </p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>What are the biggest benefits?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> I just feel great. I&#8217;m happier. I&#8217;m more motivated. I just feel great.</p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>What have been the biggest challenges? Initially? Ongoing?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> Initially, it was difficult to adjust&mdash;just getting used to the whole system of counting calories and logging them, and exercising even if I was tired, etc. It&#8217;s a whole new world, but you learn quickly, and you learn more each day. The continuing challenge is the way people react&mdash;&#8221;oh, you&#8217;re wasting away!&#8221;&mdash;and being made to feel guilty. As in, it sucks you don&#8217;t drink, or why don&#8217;t you want to get pizza with us, etc. So I&#8217;ve adjusted by making my social life not revolve around food, and reminding people that I am making healthy choices and I am healthy. I&#8217;m not thin because I am ill, thank God. I am thin because, like Gweynth Paltrow said, I work my ass off. And I&#8217;m not going to let other people&#8217;s food or body issues derail my health.</p>
<p><strong>TAS:</strong> <em>For anyone looking to initiate similar healthy lifestyle changes, what advice do you have to offer?</em></p>
<p><strong>AVG:</strong> Just do it. For the first month, lay low. Believe it or not, people will sabotage&mdash;consciously or otherwise&mdash;your efforts. Humans suck that way. So establish your changes and your routine, and give them time to stick before you introduce elements of your old life again. </p>
<p>Be patient. It can be hard, frustrating, and sometimes you might not want to say no to ice cream or go to the gym. But if you WANT to be healthy, and you WANT to feel better, you will do it.</p>
<p>Forgive yourself. If you have a bad day and eat a whole pie, just get back on track the next day. Don&#8217;t go off the rails after one bad episode. </p>
<p>Stay on track. You&#8217;re the one who is in control, so put yourself first. Trust me, the kids and the dogs and the spouse will gladly have you done at the gym for an hour if it means you don&#8217;t hate yourself. Do it. Do it because you want to, and don&#8217;t let anyone make you feel guilty or otherwise. You only get one life, and you might as well live it to enjoy it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sun is setting in France, sherbet melting down the trees. You tell me about this, describing Rouen, the fresh scallops you sautéed for dinner, all of the little dogs you’ve seen waiting patiently for their owners outside of cafés. And I place you, face down, on my bed. Photograph by photograph, pulled from the walls of my bedroom to the cadence of your voice. I do not tell you that I am doing this, as you describe the sunset. I listen more closely to the students passing you in the hallway at your payphone post. In my life you have faded to a slow background hum and I realize that I have finally fallen out of love. That I am safe now. I can begin to divest myself, article by article, of our relationship.</p>
<p>Objects are defined by the stories of the people who have given them meaning. Meaning that can change as people change, the gifts they gave you or the things they simply left behind taking on new significance over time. </p>
<p>I come from a family of collectors. My maternal grandparents were in the antiques business for years and their house is filled with collections. Cast iron doorstops line the stairs to their third floor library in the shape of everything from sailboats to reindeer. Shelves of duck decoys and a wall of fishing lures (hand-painted and hand-carved) decorate my Grandpa Amthor’s hunting room. He can tell you where he picked up each of the intricate samurai swords he stows in a closet and only brings out on great occasion. He can tell you where he found arrowheads and rare coins as a boy combing through junkyards in Flint. Or about the man who sold him a Confederate Civil War brass belt buckle at a garage sale 20 years ago. His library is filled with weighty tomes on Incan history and old issues of National Geographic. Every time I visit he has something new to show me. Another story, another history&mdash;his or someone else’s, sometimes grandiose, sometimes autobiographical.</p>
<p>As a red-headed toddler with a lisp, I angrily threatened to break all of my mother’s Majolica plates and cut down all of her flowers. Incredulous and amused that I was able to identify her attachment to these things, she still made me eat my broccoli. I grew up healthy and materialistically unsentimental. Or so I thought.</p>
<p>When a person has left your life, they leave behind a space occupied by traces of them. A hickey or a T-shirt. An inscription in a birthday card, a recipe, a bracelet you received for Christmas. These visual cues are not always welcome. They often do not wash off like lipstick bruises. Souvenirs of people you have explored are not always looked upon as fondly as I Love NY memorabilia or shot glasses bearing city names. There are people who have not walked away, but whom you have chosen to remove. Methodically, I have found that the process of removal continues as I purge them from my personal space. In this way, I suppose I edit my own history. Or at least its presence in my present.</p>
<p>Wearing jewelry from an ex has always felt like reasserting that person’s expired claim on me by decorating myself with a token of a now-stale affection. The terms of parting are irrelevant and the piece becomes an artifact. Perhaps stowed in a drawer where it can be called upon to conjure memories at my convenience. Out of sight and yet valued like a private treasure. Too personal to be on display or shared.</p>
<p>There are things that hold meaning to me separate from the intentions of their source. An amber ring that reminds me more of someone’s faith in my ability to make it through a difficult time than it reminds me of him. A silver locket brought back to me from Louisiana one summer, on a chain clasped by a safety pin. It was given to me by a boy I dated briefly in high school, who broke up with me for wearing hot pink pedal pushers to his death metal band’s first show. He was the first person I ever talked to openly about grieving the loss of my cousin&mdash;my childhood best friend. The locket reminds me of her, not him. Years later, I still wear it regularly. Always guarded with my feelings, it still makes me grateful that he showed me it was all right to be human, to know loss and to grieve.</p>
<p>There are many things that have simply found their way to the trash or the Goodwill. Right now there is a pile of old concert T-shirts stuffed between a stack of jeans and a stack of dress pants, aggravating me every time I open my armoire. They belong to a doctor from Royal Oak that I may or may not see again. Still saturated with his cologne, still bearing the shape of his broad shoulders. Calling to mind the beer belly I was always tempted to poke, curious if it would jiggle while we lay naked in bed, fascinated to have discovered its existence. When I broke up with him, I asked if he wanted me to mail his belongings back, but was amicable to the suggestion of meeting up for lunch and returning them in person. Here they sit. Intruding on my space. Imposing him amidst my wardrobe. Do I wait until he is in town again? Do I take them out with this week’s garbage? I will never feel that their ownership has transferred to me. I reject them, as I rejected him. I want to close off this little path back into my life.</p>
<p>These misplaced items so often become territorial battles. Physical proof of the navigational limbo necessary for transitioning to life without someone. Boundary issues. I once had a friend call me in a state of panic from Alaska because she had just broken up with a guy who was back in Michigan. And then she realized that he still had her laptop. She hysterically requested that I make a two-hour drive to recover it for her. Another friend endured months of passive-aggressive emails with an ex that held her things hostage, demanding some sort of emotional reparations. All sorts of hurt and the resulting irrationality taking form in inane objects, being levered in an attempt at closure. A scramble toward it or a resistance to it.</p>
<p>I went through a phase where every time I made an ill-advised sexual decision, I lost an earring. Just one. A pearl in the back of a car. A chandelier on a pillow. I held onto half of a favorite pair for months before finally resigning myself to its place in the garbage. Then I attended a party at his house and he produced the missing gem with a theatrical and very deliberate flourish. Until that moment, I had forgotten all about both the earrings and the sex. And I felt appropriately ridiculous, as if I’d truly scattered myself about town in pieces. </p>
<p>We know that is both illogical and unrealistic to transfer our emotions to objects, to allow people and memories to inhabit them. Yet doing just this is ingrained in us in by the very idea of home. In most cultures, people decorate their surroundings and value their private shelters, asserting ownership over the contents. Home is the haven where you ideally get to choose your visitors. Where you get to assert your taste and your preferences. Where you can lock the door. Where you can display the things that you have collected. Cleaning house can mean sweeping out the unwanted, decluttering the personal space that resides within us more than simply around us. Lingering remnants of relationships (or relations) past can be like a haunting. </p>
<p>There is little to be done with the quiet whispering of names uttered just once muscled through your veins from the silent vault of your heart. I believe that you carry people with you, in fragments that comprise a part of you. Lessons you learned, moments you cherished. Like a person who drinks too much whiskey and later reels at the smell of it, there will be things you would rather expel. It is as natural to get rid of pants that you have outgrown as it is to break the hold of memories you have outgrown, and to assert your ability to do so. To expedite the process. The pieces that you need will stay with you, intangibly. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drunken texty-thumbs can get the best of anyone. There’s actually an iPhone application that makes you solve math problems in order to determine if you are sober enough to be peppering your contacts with messages at 2 a.m. on a Saturday. Alcohol dissolves some people’s electronic boundaries, giving them the liquid courage necessary to make brazen, outlandish statements from the safety of their pub table to exes who live on the other side of the country. And to do so in a completely abbreviated language that embraces belligerent typos! But we’ve all got that obnoxious friend who soberly (and somberly) abuses the convenience of e-communication. Inspired by textsfromlastnight.com and utterly devoid of imagination, these pests are truly vile.</p>
<p>Have you ever been on a chat service and received “I’m bored” or “entertain me” as a message? Does your blood pressure skyrocket or do you just roll your eyes? I find myself fondling the nearest sharp object.</p>
<p>It seems that people do many things just because they can. Not necessarily because they want to, and definitely not because they <em>should</em>, but because it’s easy and they are in want of entertainment. We are told that technology brings us closer, but there are so many moments throughout the course of the day where I find myself questioning the validity of that. Wondering if perhaps we haven’t complicated things tremendously with everything that texting, for example, cannot convey. Worse than that, I have begun to wonder if we risk losing the ability to be alone. </p>
<p>The limitations of texting are tremendous. I know several couples who have banned it from their relationship completely, based on the ridiculous misunderstandings that lack of tone or context have created. Personally, my biggest complaint arises when interested romantic parties use it as a substitute for actual conversation. It simultaneously expedites and exhausts possibilities. You meet someone, you text zealously for a week or two at most. You meet someone else, the process repeats. At some point, you might find yourself quietly admitting how dull and tiresome this routine becomes. How predictable, no matter how witty or quirky your fellow texter may be at first. It’s like making a beeline for disenchantment.</p>
<p>The advent of sexting has also made said romance-seekers bolder about feeling out their prospects, if you will. A particularly dim-witted bouncer kept texting me photos of what he was making for dinner in an attempt to lure me to his apartment. This went on for weeks. I’d discover little photos of everything from a tiny filet marooned on a giant white plate to a heaping pile of indiscernible casserole, with captions like, “babe just look at what u r missing!” When this did not warrant a response, he got serious. And sent me a photo clearly taken in his bathroom mirror, by himself, of his pale, perplexingly scrawny torso. What he must have thought were G.I. Joe lines were hip bones. The angle at which he had to hold the phone cut his head out of the photo entirely, and created a disconcerting, disembodied torso floating in glare and fluorescent lighting. The effect was eerily similar to something you might find suspended on a meat hook in a slaughterhouse. I was again, not enticed.</p>
<p>There is a fine line between persistent and creepy, and mediums such as texting blur those lines miserably. When you give someone your cell phone number, you are inviting them into your life in a major way. They might catch you in the bath tub, at a funeral, mid-orgasm, or in a potentially disastrous moment of vulnerability. The point is – they are able to catch you any time. What of privacy?</p>
<p>One of my professors used to refer to cell phones as electronic tethers. It was in a class my sophomore year of college, long before texting had become a craze and was built into everyone’s data plan. At that point, it was already annoying that people felt like just because they had the ability to call you at any time, you should be <em>available</em> at any time. Texting, the memo of e-communication, amplifies this sense of urgency to respond. Typically, it’s a quip or a quick bit of info. Meet here, wear this. My attitude toward memos is to discard all things not directly applicable to me. If they can be sent in that format, they can be deemed generally unimportant. If you make me laugh, I’ll probably respond. It could be hours later, though. </p>
<p>Instantaneous communication makes us all feel obligated to respond instantaneously. The pressure I sometimes feel about this makes me grateful for my naturally stubborn streak. Time set aside for solitude is time set aside for solitude. And sometimes those additional portals to the outside world need to be sealed off, too. I don’t need another dingbat bouncer interrupting my cuddle time with Cormac McCarthy, competing against beautifully graphic prose with some unfathomable violence to the English language, like “guuuurl, I been textin you, I been callin you. . . .”  Or, if I am really lucky, “my cck is so hard right now.” </p>
<p>Misspelled sexts. Now those&mdash;those may actually be worth receiving, considering the delicious mix of shock, horror, and despair they illicit. So my friends, I implore you to think before you text. Before you go shooting your worthless thoughts out to your entire address book. Really, those dumber revelations&mdash;you’d benefit from keeping those to yourself. Every time you send one, I assure you that a baby otter dies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just which set of lips is this supposed to wet, exactly? I ask myself.</p>
<p>It’s late, I am alone, bathed in the light of the television, taking in noises of pleasure that transcend all language barriers. You can’t blame me for watching. I flipped to it on accident. And now I can’t look away.</p>
<p>The way the rich chocolate batter rolls off of the spatula in coagulated bulbs and folds, the way the chocolate chips crest and disappear as they are stirred into the bowl. And I think, this is it. Here comes the money shot. The camera zooms in closer.</p>
<p>There is an eerie similarity between gourmet cooking shows and pornography. The way that they are cut and filmed, the strange correlation between the purposes of both; to build desire with sensory stimulation, and then to satisfy with the promise of pleasure. I don’t believe this is any accident, although it is a truth full of sad irony.</p>
<p>America’s avid indulgence in both gluttony and lust has created a cultural paradigm where people harbor a great deal of neurosis about both. This is evident on several levels: food and sex are everywhere, and as a society we consume like gluttons, then lust for more&mdash;newer, bigger, faster, better. Whether this means casual sex with multiple partners or trying every position illustrated in Kama Sutra, paying top dollar for rare truffles in a Michelin restaurant, or simply stepping into the cereal aisle and being confronted with everything from All Bran to Fruit Loops&mdash;there are an overwhelming number of options. Not to mention substitutes.</p>
<p>You know there is a broad market for something when there is a wealth of competing products. Furthering the cereal example, consumers could choose oatmeal, muffins, granola bars, or protein shakes&amp;dash;naming just a few alternate breakfast options. With sex, the proliferation of toys, costumes, and accoutrements mirrors our fixation. Demand seems to be driving supply in both cases, and they both receive incredible amounts of media attention. The number of cooking and baking blogs popping up on the internet has to be rivaling the amount of porn.</p>
<p>Eating has long since become more an act of pleasure than nourishment. Most people aren’t having sex regularly with the goal of making babies. The two become entirely connected when you consider the market for diet or sexual enhancement products, and how advertising targets our insecurities about both.</p>
<p>Indulgence seems to often be followed by a cycle of guilt and self-imposed punishment for partaking. We have a very complicated relationship with pleasure. It’s our obsession and our shame, great joy and frequent disappointment. Eating your feelings is a common joke about comforting oneself, but I know a great deal of people who have tried to fuck their feelings, too. </p>
<p>There is a voyeuristic way to how we view both food and sex in the media, but I’m beginning to wonder if the two are not becoming interchangeable options for pleasure. Has the American Dream mutated into seeking constant, uninterrupted, unthinking stimulation and pleasure? </p>
<p>What does this say about the state of sex? What does this say about the state of food?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living in a college town, when you are still young enough to occasionally be confused with the undergrads and happen to be a grad student yourself (even though you are going to school on nights and weekends while holding down a full-time job), it&#8217;s not easy to admit this. In fact, what I am about to disclose doesn&#8217;t seem to go over well when you fall into the category of single at any sexually viable age.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to drink.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like going to the bar. I especially dislike it when someone asks me to meet them for drinks as part of the dating process. It isn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t appreciate good alcohol, because I do. A well-mixed cocktail with a house-made infusion is something I&#8217;m likely to order while out to dinner. I&#8217;ve spent a shameful amount of money on fine scotch. I enjoy trying microbrews. In my apartment, there are usually several bottles in the wine rack, a few beer options in the fridge, and a prominent liquor selection displayed near my entryway. But I have a confession. The same beer sits in my fridge for months unless I have people over. The bottles of wine collect dust until I have company, too. I bought the liquor because I find the bottles aesthetically pleasing and they reflect light nicely on this antique mirrored tray I found, especially with the set of cut crystal tumblers I have. </p>
<p>Alcohol is something that I like the idea of more than I like the reality of. A cold beer on a hot summer day at the ballpark can be wonderful&mdash;for the first sip. If I have the entire beer instead of a water, and we are sitting in the sun, I am going to still want the water and end up with an instant headache, then need to miss part of the game to wait in line to pee. The delicious pitcher of sangria split over conversation with a friend will invariably leave me massively hung over the next morning. Hung over means more than vaguely uncomfortable anymore. It means water-retention: bloating and visible puffiness in the face. It means a splitting, sneaky late-afternoon headache after I thought I had gotten away unscathed. My tolerance was definitely higher as a college student that imbibed regularly, but I am starting to wonder if at some point I just accepted these discomforts without question because they seemed merely a part of the cycle and the process in that particular social environment. So maybe I simply chose not to be in tune with what it does to my whole system. With adult responsibilities, I certainly notice it now. My free time is invaluable, and I don&#8217;t want to spend hours that I could sneak in a workout or thoroughly enjoy a new book curled up on the couch, half-interested in a shitty movie and sipping Alka-Seltzer.</p>
<p>My reasons go well beyond this, though. What I&#8217;ve offered thus far is just the easiest explanation.</p>
<p>Recreational drinking is a lot like recreational eating. We have social norms about sharing food and meeting for drinks&mdash;they tend to be the two default options for spending time with other people. They both tend to result in over-indulgence and offer a buffer for the actual visit. Eating and drinking both give you something to do with your hands and your mouth that cut down on awkward silences and give you a sense of purpose in the moment. I am eating. I am drinking. There is less pressure to just talk, because you are also doing something functional.</p>
<p>Alcohol isn&#8217;t good for you. There are studies that show that a glass of wine can actually be good for your heart, or that hops have nutritional benefits. Well, other safely ingested items also contain these beneficial properties without all of the empty calories. It&#8217;s never going to be the best choice for any form of health benefit. Alcohol is a simple carbohydrate. It gets converted to fat quickly if the energy isn&#8217;t used immediately. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t tend to pre-drink as a warm-up for exercise. I tend to drink while seated. I tend to remain seated until I decide I am unfit for public and need to retire to bed. In the past, there was sometimes the activity of embarrassing dancing or inadvisable horizontal recreation, but now I prefer to be sober for those endeavors. Crazy, I know. Truth be told, I find awkwardness very revealing, and often endearing. If you can&#8217;t weather the potential discomfort of being naked, literally or metaphorically, then you should probably not be doing certain things in the first place.</p>
<p>All of this said, it is a challenge to sidestep drinking as soon as you are of legal age. The bar is where people tend to want to meet, especially singles. Ordering drinks with dinner has some tag of hipness attached to it, like you never quite get over the assertion that you CAN order alcohol. And I am finding that the peer pressure associated with drinking is strikingly similar to the people you know who are likely to passively sabotage your attempts at healthy eating or portion control. It often comes from those same people. They want to imbibe and they would feel more comfortable if you did, too. Or they don&#8217;t want to go out alone. </p>
<p>Drinking alone and eating alone are similarly seen as pitiable by those that would never dream of doing either if at all avoidable. I have never really enjoyed drinking alone, but I live alone so lo and behold, most of my meals occur alone. One has to eat. In the process of these meals consumed in solitude, there has been a healthy shift away from seeing eating as a social event and starting to connect food more with fuel. But it means that I am getting protective of my routine and it can be really difficult for me to be confronted with the food issues of others because I have worked so hard to address my own. It is not always easy to prevent your decisions about food from being influenced by those around you. Someone orders dessert and it makes you feel entitled to it, too, even though you are already full to bursting. . . someone asks you to share dessert so you feel like a party pooper declining. . . same with appetizers. Or shots at the bar. Do you really want to be the lame one? The answer for me is becoming a resounding YES 90% of the time. Part of me can&#8217;t wait to grow into the middle-aged woman with the confidence to make these decisions and choose not to notice how they make others uncomfortable. You know why it makes other people uncomfortable? If you actively choose to do the right thing for you, they are confronted for a moment with whether or not it is actually the wisest choice for them, too. And if someone is trying to cut loose, they don&#8217;t want to consider that.</p>
