										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing that can ruin a really great book is a weak ending. But not all weak endings are created equal. Sometimes there is too much closure, things are tied in neat little bows and nothing is left to the imagination. A talented writer creates a world I want to inhabit, no matter how similar or different it is to my own world. If the story is well written I want to think about it after I finish it. If the entire future of a character is played out in the ending it leaves me with little to imagine myself.</p>
<p>Some weak endings are too happy. I like knowing who the bad guy is but he doesn’t always need to be caught. I like knowing the main character learned something in the course of the novel, or improved themselves, but they don’t always need to be perfectly content. <em>How to Be an American Housewife</em> by Margaret Dilloway did this. The Japanese main character, Shoko, was shunned by her brother for marrying an American GI after the war. She seeks his forgiveness when she finds out she has a fatal heart condition and sends her daughter to Japan to find him. The story is beautifully written, the characters have all struggled in their lives and persevered but the ending was too happy, too mushy; I found it hard to believe. The brother caves and forgives his sister. He has ignored her for decades and in one short visit he lets go of his anger completely? Maybe I hold grudges too well, but I found this ending too sticky sweet, especially after the excellent writing that preceded it.</p>
<p><em>Girl in Translation</em> by Jean Kwok did not have this problem. The Chinese-American characters were struggling and making life-changing choices every day. When I got to the ending I was pleased and humbled. The main character, Kimberly Chang, made choices I don’t think I could have made, choices I am sure many immigrants have been forced to make as they strive for the American Dream. Kwok did her characters justice by giving them a satisfying ending, not a happy one. </p>
<p>Endings really make or break a book for me. I don’t need a twist or a surprise; I just need honesty. Even if a book is set in the most bizarre fantasy world, the characters still have a human integrity that a bad ending can destroy. Science fiction/fantasy books, in my opinion, have the greatest potential for weak endings. Usually the author has created an entire universe to give his characters the exact dilemmas and challenges that they need. When bug-like aliens attack earth and only a child can save the human race, or a small subset of America is kept free of technology while the rest of the world goes crazy with tech power, or an autistic kid is controlled by an evil spirit communicating with him via a plastic telephone anything can happen. These books have the most potential for weak endings because the author isn’t held to the rules of our world. He or she could easily tie up all the loose ends with whatever fantasy world logic that resides there. Every time I read great sci-fi/fantasy I hope that the ending is open enough for me to insert a little life of my own.</p>
<p>I will also say that usually sci-fi/fantasy endings are the best. I feel as though the author spent so much time creating this new world that they know things can’t possibly be completely finished there just because this particular story is finished. I think this is also the reason so many of these types or stories turn into series. Sequels and trilogies aren’t enough when you have a rabid fan base who wants to inhabit your made-up world again and again. Rereading doesn’t offer the same level of immersion that a new story does. We want to know new things about the world these authors have created. Authors like Stephen King give us such rich worlds, intertwined in all of their stories that it is a joy to see a character from one novel play a bit part in another, we get to feel as though we are in on the joke.</p>
<p>Once, somehow, I read a great book and forgot the ending. There was a great twist that I didn’t see coming &#8212; let’s face it, I never see the twist &#8212; and then I forgot all about it. It was Orson Scott Card’s <em>Wyrms</em> and I got to experience a great ending for the first time twice. I wish that could happen again. Sure, sometimes I forget details from the middle of a book, a characters exact motivations, or a side plot, but who forgets the ending completely? I think it was a once in a lifetime kind of thing. </p>
<p>I have endings on the mind because <em>The Idler</em> is ending. It has become for me a great place to share my thoughts on books and to read about sports and video games. It gave me a reason to read a new book, chose a new author, investigate a new genre. I’m sad to see it go. After leaving the bookstore I felt adrift and now I am cast loose again. But I think all of this reading and writing experience can help guide me to my next literary destination. I will try not to make this ending too sappy, it’s what I wanted to avoid. Horrible outpourings of emotion, who needs ‘em!? </p>
<p>So I will say this: Keep reading if you enjoy reading. Keep playing video games or watching hockey if you enjoy those things. Hell, do all three at the same time if you can. Get others to join you in your pursuits and life will be great.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Nook is dead. It died in mid-March and I haven’t missed it at all. Except every now and then I thought about the book I was in the middle of reading. And once in a while I remembered how nice it was to buy new books from the comfort of my couch. Plus those weekly emails from Barnes and Noble telling me about new releases and book recommendations pretty much kept the device in my head at all times.</p>
<p>So the Nook is dead, long live the Nook. I’m thinking of buying a new one. The main problem with this plan is that the damn thing is so sensitive. One hard drop on the bedroom floor and the screen saver was broken. Instead of cycling through different authors it stuck with one face until I woke it up to read, then a new face would appear. I was taking the Nook to bed in what turned out to be a much darker room than I anticipated. Bam, I ran into the bed, dropping my phone and the e-reader. The phone is fine by the way. I have dropped my iPhone about a million times and every once in a while I can only hold conversations over speaker phone but the next time I drop it, it fixes itself. This is the kind of technology I need. Self-healing. </p>
<p>The Nook is not self-healing. I got used to seeing one author for days at a time. Sometimes I would wake up the nook just to change the face, Gertrude Stein is a little too handsome of a woman for me to have staring at me from the coffee table for days on end.</p>
<p>The next time I dropped, it the results were a little more destructive. You think I would have bought a case for it after dropping it the first time. Not me. It was fine, therefore it was tough enough to survive my lifestyle. Things end up on the floor a lot in my life. I think I can pick up just one more thing and everything goes crashing down to the ground. I was carrying the baby in one arm; his change of clothes, a cloth diaper, and the Nook were all tucked under my elbow. Things started to slide and so I tightened my grip on the baby and kept walking down the stairs. </p>
<p>Not the best plan.</p>
<p>Obviously holding the baby above all else is good. But I should have stopped, rearranged, set something down. The Nook fell, hit the wood floor, slid, fell down four steps and landed on the slate tile entryway. I thought nothing of it. It had survived the first fall. It was initiated into my way of life. I scooped it up and went on my merry way. The screen had two vertical stripes through Kurt Vonnegut’s face. No big deal. They were only slightly darker than the surrounding screen. They were a little more noticeable when I turned on the backlight but, let’s face it, I deserved it for not buying a case.</p>
<p>But it was more than lines. The backlight turned on, but nothing else did. I pushed buttons in vain. I couldn’t even turn it off and back on again, my go to electronic fixing move. I held down the power button for over two minutes. Nothing. Finally the battery died. My husband charged it for me but it never turned on again. The Nook was dead. </p>
<p>I decided I didn’t care. I didn’t really like the thing in the first place. I was old school. I liked paper books. I could totally read them while I held a sleeping baby. I went out and bought a new book light that was way too bright and had no dimmer switch. I missed the soft glow of the nook a little. I pushed the thought out of my head. Things would be fine.</p>
<p>The baby kept fussing due to my awkward page turning. My hands are not big enough to hold a 400 plus page book in one hand. I broke a few bindings. My mom spilled juice on a book. The baby kept waking up and turning his head toward the super bright light skinning down on him. I finished a book while holding him and had nothing else to read. I started to miss the Nook in earnest.</p>
<p>Plus there was that book I was in the middle of. I downloaded the Nook reader for my computer after a chat with the Barnes and Noble help crew. I immediately hated it. There is too much going on on my computer for me to be able to read a book. Plus there’s glare. And I can’t snuggle up. The screen is too bright and the battery is dying. I need a new Nook.</p>
<p>This time I’ll be smart. I already picked out a cool orange stripy case. If it isn’t sturdy enough, I’ll hit up Barnes and Noble in the mall and buy something giant to protect it. I’ll buy a screen protector and actually apply it, unlike the screen protector for my phone, which is still in a box somewhere. I’ll carry fewer things down the stairs. And next time I’m holding the baby and the Nook and the Nook starts to slide I’ll be able to let it go, knowing I’ve done my best to protect it. The Nook of course, not the baby.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>*Spoiler alert: The following review of <em>The Sixes</em> by Kate White doesn’t tell you who did it, but it tells you who didn’t*</strong></p>
<p><em>Jurassic Park</em> hit theaters for the first time when I was nine years old. My mother had thought about asking our live-in nanny, Lori, to come with us but in the end decided to make the new dinosaur movie a mother-daughter adventure. About a week later Lori came back from the theater after having seen the movie by herself.</p>
<p>“Oh my God! It was so scary!” She announced. “Those dinosaurs! Oh my God!”</p>
<p>My mom and I suppressed smiles. I mean, sure, the dinosaurs were scary. And just because I was nine and she was a grown woman didn’t mean she couldn’t have gotten more scared than I had gotten.</p>
<p>“When they came into the kitchen I was so scared! I shouted out for those poor kids to hide!”</p>
<p>What? I still remember the kitchen scene. Three velociraptors were hunting the young kids and it was dark and terrifying. But shouting? Aloud? In a movie theater?</p>
<p>“I just screamed at them that the dinosaurs were coming. A man from the theater came and asked me to please be quiet, but I couldn’t! I just had to warn them!”</p>
<p>Did I mention she was a grown ass woman? She went on to tell us that she quieted down for a while but then another scary scene came on and she shouted for the characters on the screen to watch out again and had to be quieted by the theater staff again or she needed to leave. My mother and I thanked our lucky stars that we didn’t take her with us. She didn’t last as my nanny much longer after that.</p>
<p>This exchange came to mind after I finished Kate White’s <em>The Sixes</em>. Usually I don’t try to figure out whodunit while reading mysteries but this time I thought I’d give it a go. At one point the main character, Phoebe, starts a romantic relationship with a professor, Duncan Shaw, at the university where she currently teaches. Duncan reveals over dinner that his late wife, dying of cancer, drowned in the bathtub after she fell asleep reading there. The main mystery of the novel surrounded multiple drownings in the river that ran through campus. So of course I’m here, shouting in my head at Phoebe, that DUNCAN DID IT! Watch out lady, he’s a murderer!</p>
<p>I figured that he was impatient for his wife to die, he wanted her money, and was worried that her cancer would go into remission. See, Duncan and his wife were about to separate before she got sick. He was gallant and stayed with her, even moving back to her childhood home, while she lived out her last years. He told Phoebe that people who are severely sick often don’t have the same startle reflex that healthy people have. Normally the inability to breathe would wake someone and prevent their drowning in a bathtub. But his dear dead wife was so ill that her body failed to respond. He had even warned her of the danger of reading in the tub but she ignored him.</p>
<p>LIAR! I shouted! Watch out, Phoebe! He’s asking so many questions about the case because he wants to make sure you aren’t onto him! He killed his wife for her money, she was taking too long to die and then he developed a taste for it. He’s the one who has been drugging young college students and shoving them in the river, their healthy bodies useless, unable to startle them awake enough to swim to shore.</p>
<p>I pictured him watching from the darkened shore. Clearing the slackers and dullards from this small college campus. Someone needed to warn Phoebe. I tried, but like Lori shouting in the theater, it was useless, these characters’ lives were preordained.</p>
<p>Also I was wrong.  </p>
<p>I don’t like being wrong. It’s embarrassing. Not as embarrassing as muttering to a character in a book that they need to use better judgment and stop sleeping with the killer, but close. Duncan didn’t do it. Someone else was shoving students in the river. Phoebe found out eventually, got into trouble, was hospitalized, but came out on top. Blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>All the bad guys were taken care of. But I didn’t care. Duncan didn’t do it. My imagination had taken over while I was reading the book. In my opinion, it did a better job than the author’s. Duncan would have made a creepy, dark killer. His motives only a little comprehensible. His manner unassuming, sexy, persuasive. If he were the killer the book would have been better. </p>
<p>That’s why I don’t try to figure out how books end. I don’t keep track of clues and piece together the hints and evidence. If I’m right, why read the book? It had better be superbly written to keep me going once I know the bad guy. And if I’m wrong, I feel tricked. Kate White was pointing all the fingers in the world at Duncan. Looking back, it was too obvious. I should have known better. I might have even guessed the real killer if I hadn’t been too busy shouting about the wrong guy. </p>
<p>It made me mad at White for fooling me. She could have written the book without making Duncan look so guilty. It would have been better, in my opinion if either Duncan had done it or if he had a smaller role in the whole thing. Who likes feeling stupid? I understand not wanting to reveal the bad guy too soon, as an author you want readers to finish the book and then go buy your other books as well. But there is a fine line to walk and White overstepped. Maybe I was easier to fool because I was new to playing detective. But I still didn’t like how the ending unfolded. My bad guy was the better bad guy.</p>
<p>So I was wrong, tricked, and disappointed. Not a great way to end a book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week my husband and I drove down to Ohio so I could hang out with my parents while he attends a nerd conference in Boston. I decided that a good way to pass the time would be to read aloud to Dan while he drove. I had wanted to re-read Philip Pullman’s <em>The Golden Compass</em> for a while so it was my book of choice. I figured it would help me cross one of the New Year’s resolutions off my list, get the husband to read more. Reading to him totally counts.</p>
<p>It didn’t go quite as planned. Our Ohio road trips never do. I sat in the passenger seat, literally petting the book in anticipation of reading the story again. The <em>His Dark Materials</em> trilogy has been one of my favorites for years. I remember flying through the first two books and waiting for what felt like forever for the third book to come out. It’s one of the few intermediate reading level books that also gets shelved in the adult sci-fi section. The more I read it, the more I see in it. The political and religious undertones largely escaped me when I read it as a child, but now they are why I love it as much as I do.</p>
<p>Dan was driving and we were listening to the radio. I started talking up Philip Pullman. I mentioned his only book for adults, <em>The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ</em>. I talked about how important it was to me to have Dan know my favorite stories. I stroked the cover of <em>The Golden Compass</em>. Dan could tell I was getting antsy; I wanted to get started. The husband and the baby had other plans.</p>
<p>As much as he wants to read my favorite books, being read to aloud isn’t really in my husband’s plans for a good road trip. I have to admit, the idea of it felt a little awkward. Being a real live audiobook felt a little like I was treating him like a child. Here, I will read this story to you because you can’t read it to yourself. But I had the book and I wasn’t going to let it go entirely unread. After reading about 20 pages to myself the baby decided he had had enough of this sitting quietly thing. The fussing had begun.</p>
<p>Lately, when the baby fusses, talking to him in a steady, low voice will calm him down. I don’t always have a lot to say. The things I come up with get repetitive. Lots of “I love you” and “It’s okay.” The NCAA tournament has helped. I sportscasted the Wisconsin game to the baby and he stopped squirming and listened quietly. On our road trip I climbed into the backseat next to his car seat and quickly ran out of things to say. Then I decided that if the husband didn’t want to listen to one of my favorite books, maybe the baby would. So I finally got to read aloud.</p>
<p>Since he’s a five-month-old and has no concept of plot I got to pick up right where I left off. It went perfectly. I got to read my book and calm the baby down at the same time. He still doesn’t care about books and pictures so he didn’t care that he had nothing to look at. The baby calmly chewed on his owl toy and listened to my voice. And I learned something interesting. Reading aloud is hard! It helped a lot that I had read the book before so I knew what to expect. It also helped that I was reading to someone who couldn’t be confused about my mispronunciation of difficult words. I think I said Pantalaimon and dæmon differently each time. Baby didn’t care. I stumbled over longer sentences and didn’t put proper inflection into sentences. But I got better. I learned to skim ahead and read how the character said something so I could say it in the same tone of voice. I started to pause when a character was thinking before speaking.</p>
<p>I also got more out of the story. Usually when I read I skip over the “he said angrily” and “she said while starting to make dinner,” I don’t care what they’re doing, just what they are saying to move the plot along. Even when I’m re-reading a book and don’t have that same sense of anticipation for what comes next I skim. I feel as though I already know the background and so I can skip bits. I can just read the fun parts closely and move quickly over characters I am less interested in. Sometimes when I reread a book I skip entire chapters that are about plot points I care less about. But when you read aloud you have to slow down. You have to include all the words. You have to pause to take a breath.</p>
<p>Even after the baby calmed down and eventually fell asleep I found myself continuing to read slowly. I was reading aloud in my head. I realized that Pullman does give information about the political upheaval in the very beginning of the book. I learned more about the nuances of the characters. After a while I sped up my pace again, but I could make myself slow down. I think it’s a good way to read.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to read aloud to the kid when he’s old enough to know what’s going on. I would love to read a book to him that I haven’t read before so we can experience it for the first time together. And in my imaginings of these magical nights of reading to the baby, my husband is lingering in the room so he can hear the story too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading Gillian Flynn’s <i>Gone Girl </i>I have had occasion to be irritated with my husband. Each time I think, <i>yes, I’m mad, but am I mad enough to frame him for my murder?</i> Lucky for both of us the answer keeps coming up a strong no.</p>
<p><i>Gone Girl </i>is one of those books that stays with you. You think about the characters a lot. About how true to life their actions are. How close they are to an everyday couple and how far they stretch that commonness until suddenly they are no longer recognizable as the couple next door. I had difficulty going to sleep after reading <i>Gone Girl</i>. It was hard to put down, yes, but it also led to unsettling dreams.</p>
<p>The bare bones plot is this: Amy and Nick have had a difficult few years in their marriage. On their five-year anniversary Amy goes missing and husband Nick is the number one suspect. No real surprise there, we’ve all seen enough <em>Law and Order</em> episodes to know that the husband usually did it. The book is written from Nick’s point of view, with every other chapter being an excerpt from Amy’s diary.  And trust me, this is not a diary Nick wants the police to find. You learn that Amy has faked her disappearance to punish Nick for their unhappiness. (Don’t worry, that doesn’t spoil much.)</p>
<p>In the beginning I was on the fence about Nick. He seemed nice enough but I didn’t really like him. I was reasonably sure that he did not kill his wife, he seemed too bewildered by her disappearance to have committed a crime, but I felt more pity for him than affection. Not a great set of emotions for a reader to have about a main character, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Amy was a different story all together. I never liked her. She seemed like she was trying too hard to be what Nick wanted in the beginning, trying to convince herself that she wanted those things too. Her views on their courtship and marriage tell a sadder story than Nick’s. Things had been bad long before either one of them noticed. The more I learned about Amy the less I liked her. For Nick there were points where I really cared for him, rooted for him, and saw some humanity in him. For Amy? Well, for every page I read I felt a little more desire to see her dead body wash ashore from the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Gillian Flynn does amazing things in <i>Gone Girl</i>. I don’t want to give away too much of the plot, since she keeps you guessing the entire time. I am not the type of person to try to piece together whodunit but I think that the number of twists would surprise even those readers who like to solve the case.</p>
<p>What I was pleasantly surprised about was how much I liked the book without liking the main characters. The more I learned about Nick the less I liked him, but I still needed to know what happened next. That was unusual for me. In most cases if I don’t connect with a character I give up. Who cares if they find the wife of this jerky guy? Flynn’s writing style and plot development were what I enjoyed. And in the end it worked out pretty well that I didn’t like Amy or Nick. They were self-centered and a little psychotic, I’ll let you judge how psychotic, and they don’t end up very happy in the end.</p>
<p>The alternating narrators do more than help move the plot along. It provides some insight into how a marriage falls apart. Seeing Nick and Amy’s differing opinions on so many events really makes you wonder how they were ever happy, <i>if</i> they were ever happy. Nick truly knows nothing about his wife. At first you think that if only he had paid attention, listened better then they wouldn’t be in this failing marriage. But Amy wasn’t as forthcoming as she pretended to be. And then there’s that whole crazy person thing that you really need to watch out for when you get married. It really sets the whole tone for a relationship.</p>
<p>Every morning I would regale my husband with what I had read the night before. He would give me horrified looks as I told him how Nick had officially been arrested, how the crime scene was suspicious, that Amy was a conniving bitch. The whole plot starts from such a normal place and then events spiral out of control. And then when I finished the book and filled him in on the final details he asked the question I’m sure Gillian Flynn wants all husbands who read <i>Gone Girl</i> to ask: “Honey, you would never do that to me, right?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have always loved watching TV. Yes, I said loved. I watch far too much and I blame my mother for that. She limited my TV watching when I was a kid. For a while growing up we didn’t even have a TV. (My babysitters were very bored after I went to bed.) I never watched <em>Sesame Street</em> or <em>Fraggle Rock</em>. At my father’s house the television screen was six inches. It wasn’t even a color TV. The only thing I remember watching on it was <em>Star Trek</em>. Once I got into middle school and high school I watched a bit more, but my mom was still there trying to curb my TV time. I would watch TV standing up with my hand on the cable box, ready to hit the power button and scurry off to start my chores the second I heard her car pull in the driveway. Obviously I had to make up for this lack of screen time in my childhood by watching an obscene amount of television (and movies on TV) once I hit adulthood.</p>
<p>Despite my devotion to television &#8212; you should see my cable bill &#8212; I still love books more. Lately I’ve been trying to figure out why. I think a big part of it is the freedom reading a book gives you. I don’t mean you can travel to new places or whatever the libraries of America try to convince you books can do. I mean that when I read a book I can picture the story unfolding in my head. And just because the author gives a main character blue eyes and fair skin doesn’t mean that’s how he looks to me. I can shorten him a little below the towering height a writer describes. I can ditch the blue eyes and give him brown ones like the boy I had a crush on in grade school. I can picture his smile and his mannerisms. With a movie you get what the casting director wants you to see.</p>
<p>With a book you can slow down and savor well-written passages. You can be surprised that an object mentioned in chapter one has a great deal of importance in the final pages because there wasn’t a slow dramatic camera pan to it. You can create your version of the world the author created.</p>
<p>This is not to say movies are bad or of lower quality than books. They&#8217;re an entirely different art form. And I do enjoy watching movies based on books I’ve enjoyed. To stop myself from fussing about all the differences I try to see the movie as a detailed summary of the book. Minor characters are often lost, plot points are condensed, motivations aren’t always fully explained. There’s nothing wrong with this, it’s just what makes the book better. I will always cry harder when a character dies in the book than in the movie.</p>
<p>Sometimes filmmakers try to capture the entire book. <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> was made into two movies. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> movies are all over three hours long. George R. R. Martin’s books are a television series on HBO and they still have to skip small details. I know making a book into a film can do wonders for the sales of that book. Finding out a movie I liked is a book often encourages me to read the book. What author wouldn’t love the boost in sales? </p>
<p>The notable exception to this rule is <em>American Psycho</em> (2000). The movie is fantastic, one of my favorites. A few years ago my husband bought the book, assuming that because he liked the movie so much he would enjoy it. I’ve been encouraging him to read more fiction so I proposed that we both read it for a little husband/wife book group. Neither of us made it past 60 pages. It’s awful. Obviously this is just my opinion, but I was shocked at the difference. I know one of the themes is consumerism and the movie touches that nicely. The book hits you over the head. I got tired of reading brand names somewhere around page five. It’s like half the text. And I felt like nothing was happening, the action was too slow, the characters too dull. </p>
<p>I wondered how this could be. Was I missing something? Was the novel better than the first read? I did a little investigating and I learned that Bret Easton Ellis, the author, wants to do a remake of the movie. Then I learned that Bret Easton Ellis is an idiot. He wants a shallow, rich, useless reality star to play Patrick Bateman, a role played impeccably by actor Christian Bale. First of all a remake would do nothing for this movie. <em>Total Recall</em> was remade with a different take on the story; <em>Star Trek</em> was set in an alternate reality. <em>American Psycho</em> was perfection in its first iteration; it needs no reboot. And you don’t need an insipid rich douche in real life to play one on the big screen. That’s the whole reason acting exists. A good actor can play a psychopath without actually being one. It’s actually amazing that Ellis didn’t ruin the movie. He didn’t write the screenplay and it shows. The director saw something in that book of his and polished it until it shown. </p>
<p>I’ve never fully understood that “exception proving the rule” phrase, but I think this nails it. Books and movies are each good in their own way and when they come together in capable hands magic can happen. I think it’s more often the case that a movie does a book a disservice – <em>The Golden Compass</em> movie was a wreck – than the other way around. Both are creative endeavors I will continue to enjoy, I’ll just always enjoys books a little more. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I bought an e-reader and I don’t like it. It’s not the wrong one for me, I did my research. The Kobo was too small, I don’t like Amazon so no Kindle for me, and the iPad provided too many distractions. I have enough trouble trying to watch TV and Facebook at the same time, I don’t need a tablet with games to read a book. The Nook is lightweight and is backlit for nighttime reading. It has has a cool screen saver of different authors. They are kind enough to provide the names of the authors so I don’t feel too dumb. </p>
<p>But I don’t like it. I want to like it. Or at least have a decent reason for not liking it. At first I was frustrated because there was no way to turn on the screen saver, seemed like a legitimate reason to not like it. Then I looked it up online and found out how to press the home button to turn the screen saver on. So there went that complaint. The battery life is fantastic. The wi-fi works great. I can buy books with a simple tap of the screen. I can search by author or title. I can browse the bestsellers and recommendations based on my downloads. So why don’t I like it?</p>
<p>I bought it because this baby makes reading extremely difficult. He wakes up when I turn the pages of a book. I can only read the smaller paperbacks because I have only one hand available and larger paperbacks are unwieldy. Hardcovers are out of the question. Sometimes the book I want to read isn’t the one that’s closest to me. Being a little tired all the time makes it a lot harder to hold more than one plot in my mind at a time. The Nook solves these problems and more. It’s a bunch of books all in one spot. Tapping the screen turns the page. My booklight died long ago and so I was limited to daylight hours for reading. Not great in Michigan in February. The Nook’s glow light allows me to read in low light or no light. I don’t have to leave the house to buy books. Any parent can tell you convenience is key. But I’m not happy with it.</p>
<p>It’s just not the same. I like reading words on a page and not a screen. I’m old school. I like the feel of pages. I like dog-earring them. I like to underline interesting passages. These feel like weak complaints. The Nook lets me look up words in the dictionary, which is great. I can read newspapers and magazines in addition to books. I wish I liked it more.</p>
<p>I’m going to keep using it, maybe I need more than a week to get used to it. In that week I’ve read a book and a half on my Nook. That’s a lot for me right now. It had been over a week since I had even touched a book before I bought my Nook. This is the best I can do right now. It may feel like a second-rate tool, but at least it will keep me in literature. Maybe the lower prices of ebooks will encourage me to try new authors. I’m pretty sure I can borrow and return library ebooks from the comfort of my couch. There are so many pluses and so few minuses, so I’ll use it. But I won’t like it. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago our power went out. It had been happening during bad weather all winter, usually for just a few minutes. This time it lasted hours. Once it got down to 58 degrees we decided to head over to my brother-in-law’s for some heat and electricity. </p>
<p>After much fussing and crying I got the baby to sleep in their bed, which means I had thirty minutes of freedom on my hands. Yes, the baby only sleeps on his own for thirty minutes. Aren’t kids fun? I hadn’t thought to bring a book with me and my phone was in with the baby playing white noise. I was almost frantic to do something without a baby in my arms. After looking through the books in the living room and not finding anything that grabbed my attention I started snooping around in my niece’s room. She’s twenty and has a mix of young adult titles and classics. I chose <em>Ethan Frome</em> and had twenty-five blissful minutes reading about a winter much colder and snowier than ours.</p>
<p>Perusing the family books and my niece’s personal collection made me think about my collection. My collection of book is about half science fiction/fantasy. There are equal parts mystery and young adult. My only horror is Stephen King. If you were to judge me by my books you would think I’m well-read and intelligent. This is because I also own a couple dozen classics and a handful of nonfiction science books.  Working at a bookstore opened me up to owning more books than your average person. Because I was surrounded by such tempting titles I bought a lot. But, as you know from my New Year’s Resolutions, I haven’t read a lot of them.</p>
<p>I tend to buy books for a far more sophisticated and intellectual person than I really am. I have Flannery O’Connor’s <em>The Complete Stories</em>, <em>United States Essays 1952-1992</em> by Gore Vidal, <em>Catch-22</em> by Joseph Heller, and <em>DNA</em> by James Watson (of Watson and Crick). The O’Connor I bought because a coworker recommended it and I wanted to look smart; I use the Vidal book to press flowers. <em>Catch-22</em> was a book club book I never finished (aka barely started) and <em>DNA</em> makes me feel like I’m still a little bit of a scientist.</p>
<p>I buy books for the person I want to be.</p>
<p>Given a chance to read a book while my husband bought groceries with the baby, I sat down in our grocery superstore’s book section and read the first few chapters of the new Janet Evanovich book, <em>Notorious Nineteen</em>. Spoiler alert: Stephanie’s car explodes in the first few pages. Talk about lowbrow. At home I’m reading <em>Xenocide</em> by Orson Scott Card, a book I practically have memorized, part of the Ender saga. I borrowed <em>Ethan Frome</em> from my niece but I haven’t touched it since. I liked it. I find it very interesting, well written, and captivating. I have a strong feeling that I will be returning it unfinished.</p>
<p>My niece has read it. She even recommended the follow up, written by another author, about Ethan Frome’s wife, aptly titled Zeena. She has read most of the books on her shelves. They aren’t too wide in range, like mine are. They look like they all belong to the same person. Her books show where she came from, literarily, and where she is going. My books might tell where I’m going, if only I made the move to read them and actually head there.</p>
<p>All of these unread intellectual books do look very nice on my bookshelves. They grace my piano and line the mantle of our fireplace. I organize them a little by genre. Mostly how they look the prettiest. There are vases, candles, and other knick-knacks thrown in to decorate. I dust them and shift them around, but I don’t read them.</p>
<p>My husband’s books are more honest than mine, as well. He has books on brewing beer, installing car stereos, Windows servers, and whatever CCENT/CCNA ICND1 is. He had a copy of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> that he read in high school. These are his true interests. He uses the nerd books regularly and plans to brew beer this summer. While I on the other hand will probably not ever delve into the world of DNA structure analysis. </p>
<p>When I was working at the bookstore, I definitely judged customers by the books they bought. Most memorable was the woman who bought <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> and an Amish inspirational fiction book. Those did not belong in the same bag. But then again, neither do <em>The Canon</em> by Natalie Angier and <em>The Other Boleyn Girl</em>, which I have stacked on top of each other. I should probably judge people less harshly. Something about glass houses and throwing stones comes to mind. </p>
<p>Perhaps I should also judge myself less harshly. My books show that I am trying to grow as a person, as a reader. I want to read all the classics. I want to read histories and memoirs. I like to read mysteries and horror. I don’t feel like I properly enjoy short stories, which is why my coworker recommended Flannery O’Connor in the first place. Maybe it’s admirable that I’m trying to grow. Maybe I just like the look of books and the potential that they hold. My niece and my husband can have the monopoly on honest book collections.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe names hold power. They connect us to our family and our culture. Many cultures believe each name has a meaning and therefore names must be picked carefully to suit the bearer. They are one of the first things we ask when we meet someone and forgetting someone’s name can be an insult. People like to be remembered, when you can call someone by their name they feel as though they are important to you. Not just “that guy with the beard” or “the woman who spoke too much at the party”, but real people who made an impression on you.</p>
<p>This is why I have always been fascinated with pseudonyms. When I was in grade school, around third or fourth grade, we had to write a report on our favorite author. My favorite series was the Hardy Boys written by Franklin W. Dixon. I hauled my little ass to the library and proceeded to get the most disappointing news of my life. Franklin W. Dixon wasn’t a real person. A collection of writers penned the Hardy Boys, they made up the name and wrote under it so it seemed as though one man wrote the series. The Nancy Drew books weren’t written by Caroline Keene either, but I thought those books were dumb &#8212; she entered flower arranging competitions for crying out loud &#8212; so I didn’t care as much. I’m sure I wrote the report but I couldn’t tell you what author I picked, my heart was broken, my favorite author didn’t exist. The world was a cruel place.</p>
<p>Fast forward five years to when I discovered Stephen King. I loved the horror and the slow drawn out suspense. When I learned that he wrote under the pseudonym Richard Bachman I was intrigued. At least this time I wasn’t reading Bachman first and feeling betrayed when I found out he was really King. This was 1999. King had been outed as Bachman around the time I was born. He had invented the pseudonym because at the time (the late 1970s) publishers were worried about an author saturating the market. King could easily write more than one novel a year and wanted to see if something he wrote could sell under a different name. He was curious to see if people were buying his books because he was talented or if it was just because they liked the brand he had created. According to King, he was outed too soon to tell.</p>
<p>Being Stephen King he couldn’t just admit to writing under another name and then move on. He killed off Bachman and has since published books under that name claiming that he found manuscripts in Bachman’s attic. It seems creepy to kill off someone who is really yourself. I think the recesses of King’s mind are a dark place indeed. I wish he had been allowed to see his experiment progress further.</p>
<p>King’s son writes under the name Joe Hill. He too wanted to see if people would buy his books because of his talent and not the pure luck of being Stephen King’s offspring. He had ten years being Joe Hill before confirming a magazine article that had outed him as Stephen King’s son. He won a lot of awards in that time. I’m sure growing up in the King household taught him a thing or two about writing. Being Stephen King’s son helped him in more than just the name. His older brother Owen is a writer as well.</p>
<p>Lots of authors use pseudonyms. Mark Twain is probably the most famous. He had used other pen names before he came up with Mark Twain, and there are a lot of articles out there about what Mark Twain means – steamboats, water depth, and whatnot – but not a lot of information about why he wanted a pen name in the first place. I think deciding against using your own name is more interesting than the name you come up with.</p>
<p>For example the female author P. D. James writes mysteries, a male-dominated genre for writers and readers. By using her initials instead of her name, Phyllis Dorothy, she could “trick” male readers into giving her books a chance. J. D. Robb does the same thing. It’s romance writer Nora Roberts’ pen name for her mystery series. Both authors use an author photo of themselves, unlike King who used a friend of a friend for his Bachman author photos. I can’t say for sure, but I assume it’s because people know by now who P. D. James and J. D. Robb really are. In the beginning the books were probably published sans photo. There would be no point in using masculine initials on the cover and then slapping a woman’s picture on the back.</p>
<p>Breaking into a traditionally male genre like science fiction or mysteries is a good reason to give a fake name. Another good reason for creating a pen name, and a good warning story for new authors, is what happened to romance writer Jayne Ann Krentz. She signed a contract when she first began publishing her stand alone titles, giving ownership of her name, Jayne Castle, to the publisher. After she left that publisher she couldn’t publish under her name for ten years. I can’t imagine the frustration. Check the fine print folks! She came out on top by publishing under her married name, Jayne Ann Krentz, and then creating different names for her different series. She is Jayne Castle, Jayne Taylor, Jayne Bentley, Jayne Ann Krentz, Stephanie James, Amanda Glass, and Amanda Quick. She even uses different names in the same series to make it look like three different authors contribute work. Talk about making lemonade.</p>
<p>Making up names seems to go hand in hand with making up stories. The Brontë sisters and Mary Anne Evans (aka George Eliot) published under male names to get their novels out into the world and get the guarantee that their works would be received as serious literature. It’s more than a little sad that some female authors still portray themselves as men to get the readership they want. I would hope I could put my true name on anything and be judged on the merit of my work, not my gender.</p>
<p>I do see the fun in using a pseudonym. I have thought that Kay McLain would be a good name to use if I ever wanted to write romance. It would be like creating a character who writes the books. Kay McLain, my first initial and middle name, would be a sweet older lady who sees charm and romance in everyday life. She wouldn’t have my cynicism. There would be happy endings. Kelly Hannon’s stories often end badly for everyone involved.</p>
<p>Maybe Samuel Clemens wanted to separate his writing life from his real life. Maybe his lighthearted short stories needed to be written by a version of himself. I think part of the creative process is exposing yourself to the world. Maybe developing a pseudonym can take the sting off of showing your inner soul to the judgmental masses. And if Kay McLain tanks at writing romance she can fade away, while Kelly Hannon remains, allowing me to start anew with a different name and a different story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a few book related New Year’s resolutions for 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read more.</strong> This seems like an easy catch all, but with the baby and the lure of the television I haven’t been doing a lot of reading lately. I have one book upstairs in the nursery that I read while Joe naps (for exactly 25 minutes at a time) and I have another book in the living room where I spend most of my day. I made sure that the books are drastically different (one is Tom Clancy and one is science fiction) so I don’t get the plots confused. It’s slow going though, I always seem to be in the mood to read the book that’s in a different part of the house.</li>
<li><strong>Find new authors.</strong> When I do find time to read I have the bad habit of sticking with authors I know I like. While there isn’t anything inherently wrong with this, it does keep me in a safe zone. I suppose my concern is that if I pick a book or author I don’t like then I’ve wasted my time. But is it really a waste? I want to be a novelist myself so any reading could be considered research (if only I could write off all of my book purchases on my taxes). If I don’t like a plot, or if I find characters too flat it’s just a way to improve my own writing. I rarely finish books I don’t like anyway, so I’m if I am wasting time it’s not very much.</li>
<li><strong>Read nonfiction.</strong> I have an advanced readers copy of <i>The Winter King </i>by Thomas Penn that I started before it was published. It’s probably out of hardcover by now. I have another book about Tudor England with a fabulous family tree in the front cover. And <i>Stuff of Thought </i>by Steven Pinker (can’t have all of my nonfiction be English history). I should also read <i>Wild</i> by Cheryl Strayed, another advanced reading copy that I did not take advantage of having before the general public. I always convince myself that I’ll read the nonfiction books that look so interesting, from the history of DNA research to a collection of short stories from a local author. Then they collect dust while I reread my favorite novels. Nonfiction just feels like more work. Fiction feels like a break, even a darker story pulls me in more than a collection of lighthearted essays. I would like to break that misconception. More nonfiction for me please!</li>
<li><strong>Get the book group back together.</strong> We started out reading Margaret Atwood and meeting once a month. That was back when everyone in the group worked at the bookstore. Usually the day before a meeting we would all be rushing through the final chapters, asking each other if we had finished yet, often starting the discussion early over register shifts and lunch breaks. Now one of us is in Colorado, one is in New York, and three of us don’t work at the bookstore anymore. Getting this group of ladies together seems like a daunting task. But well worth it! The different views and different authors we all brought to the table pushed me out of my comfort zone. I think with a little determination and the help of the Internet we can get together again. Maybe every other month. Maybe only posting online, but we should do it ladies!</li>
<li><strong>Get the husband to read.</strong> I want our son to read. I have read a few books to him already; the response was lackluster. I dropped one of the books on his face and even that hardly got a reaction. I think that if mom and dad both read the kiddo will be more inclined to read for fun as well. My husband is far more interested in reading online tutorials about the new coding language he is learning, seems to be a new one each week. And we both read loads of books and websites about the baby. But I would like him to read more fiction. I think stories are important. They tell us about ourselves and about the world around us. Even if the plot seems far fetched or we don’t see ourselves in any of the characters, how we react to a work of fiction tells us something about who we are.</li>
</ul>
<p>These resolutions aren’t too crazy or difficult. I think the ones involving other people will be the most challenging. I mean, getting my husband to read more is really a resolution for him. Overall I want books to be a bigger part of my life than they have been in the past six months. I want to read about authors not just what they write but who they are. I want to explore translated works and read more poetry. I’ll do my best to share my experiences with you. Any book related resolution you want to share?</p>
