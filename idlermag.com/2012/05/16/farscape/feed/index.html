					<description><![CDATA[I adore &lt;i&gt;Farscape&lt;/i&gt;, and it&#039;s sad that it makes me feel old to say that my wife and I watched almost the whole series when most of it was available through Netflix just as the discs. We&#039;d binge on three or four episodes, and then mail the disc back the next day and wait breathlessly for the following disc to arrive in the mail. It all feels so quaint now.

In contrast to the &lt;i&gt;Next Generation&lt;/i&gt;-era &lt;i&gt;Stark Trek&lt;/i&gt; franchises, which seem to only find their stride in season three -- it&#039;s amazing how consistent they are that way -- &lt;i&gt;Farscape&lt;/i&gt; in some ways was at its best right from the start. I think it was inevitable that as Crichton acclimates (sort of) to his new surroundings, that he&#039;d learn to shoot and blow things up, but I think the show lost something when Moya&#039;s crew became known as the people who pulled off incredible jobs and destroying full-on military outposts.

The first episodes do an amazing job of forcing John and the crew to find nonviolent solutions to their problems, and they do it in believable and compelling ways. It felt very Henson-inspired -- very dark and very hopeful at once, and I&#039;m not sure we&#039;ve seen anything like it since.]]></description>
