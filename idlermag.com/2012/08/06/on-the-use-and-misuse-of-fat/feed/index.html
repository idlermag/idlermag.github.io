I was wondering that too! Why bother? Does it make us feel better to acknowledge that we&#039;re eating unhealthy things? Is it some sort of self-punishment pattern to make ourselves feel worse? I don&#039;t know, but I do know that I now want Oreos. xo]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Men never feel the need apologize. Why is that? I went to your cottage prepared and happy to eat cookies and Twizzlers to my heart&#039;s content and still. Why is it a relief to say, &quot;I shouldn&#039;t have this, but I&#039;m going to&quot;? Even though I&#039;m adamantly anti-&quot;sinful&quot; and that type of language. Why is saying it out loud, that you shouldn&#039;t be having something, such a security blanket? Like if I don&#039;t project that I know that eating 15 Oreos is bad, other people will somehow care about it, when they don&#039;t. But I still want the cookies. AND STILL EAT THEM. What is happening. And then looking back, the food didn&#039;t matter at all, it was all the other stuff that mattered.]]></description>
