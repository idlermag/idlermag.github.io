					<description><![CDATA[When Formula One comes to mind I (like most) immediately think of the ongoing battle between Ferrari and McLaren. The Titans of Grand Prix racing. Another great column by the good doctor and a cliffhanger no less. I imagine finishing this article with just one more installment will be difficult.The only criticism I have is I must wait two weeks to read more!]]></description>
