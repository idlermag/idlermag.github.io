					<description><![CDATA[It actually feels a bit weird to me the way that the Stephen Moffat run of &lt;i&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/i&gt; has come to center on Amy Pond. In particular, giving Pond a bit of narration before the opening credits really gives the impression that the show is centered on her worldview, but she&#039;s often a narratively passive character -- &quot;the girl who waited.&quot; She dies and spends a thousand years locked away in a box. She&#039;s kidnapped and spends more than half of a series literally doing nothing but gestating a child. There are big exceptions -- like when she saves the Doctor from nonexistence just in time to crash her wedding -- but if Moffat is really as devoted to Amelia Pond as he seems to be, he should have tried to give her a spinoff in the vein of &lt;i&gt;Torchwood&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;The Sarah Jane Adventures&lt;/i&gt;. Part of what made the Russell T. Davies run so great was the way he created an expanded universe and kept it all connected -- and how &lt;i&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/i&gt; itself stayed focused on the Doctor.

I&#039;m excited to see Matt Smith finally get his first new companion this year (other than Craig, whom I actually wouldn&#039;t mind seeing more of), but I&#039;m nervous too. Moffat&#039;s world has a lot invested in Amy Pond, more than any companion since Rose Tyler. It&#039;s a big (and needed) change. I hope he can pull it off.]]></description>
