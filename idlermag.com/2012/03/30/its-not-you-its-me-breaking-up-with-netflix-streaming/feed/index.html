					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m totally with you on this. My husband and I take FOREVER to select a movie off of our instant cue or look for something else. We just can&#039;t handle it, and it makes us feel bad. We can watch Netflix streaming for TV without this problem, but when it comes to movies, we just don&#039;t know how to make up our minds. I feel like this is somewhat similar to buying books for pleasure reading instead of getting them from the library. If I have to return it in a specified timeframe, I will actually read/watch it. Otherwise, I&#039;ll extend the task (because it becomes a task instead of a diversion) into the future indefinitely.]]></description>

Yeah, the new releases are an issue. It essentially limits your subscriber demographic to cinephiles who&#039;ll watch any movie, new or old, at any time. Unless, of course, they&#039;re as undisciplined as myself : )  Couple that with a more limited selection and you&#039;re in trouble.

Plus, it&#039;s always fun to come home to something other than bills in your mailbox!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Netflix streaming is clearly stronger for TV than for film -- which may make sense in that it&#039;s turning itself into a (cheap) competitor to cable rather than a DVD rental service.

Although I&#039;ll admit that I&#039;ve been considering re-adding a disc. The streaming selection used to be too good to be true, and now it&#039;s just barely good enough to be worth what I&#039;m paying for. You basically don&#039;t get new releases anymore, and just give up on the back catalog. I want to see &lt;i&gt;Captain America&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tampopo&lt;/i&gt;, and good luck on either of those showing up, ever.]]></description>
