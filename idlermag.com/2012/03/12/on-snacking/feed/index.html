					<description><![CDATA[My latest snack is a section (not the whole thing) of a dark chocolate bar with whipped cream from the spray can. And true confession- I have just gone ahead and sprayed the can into my mouth repeatedly :) until it is empty. That was dinner!!  Or one spoonful of peanut butter and another and another until the jar was empty! Oops! That was dinner! 
Really Jill I don&#039;t know where you get this obsessive relationship with food! tee hee! 
Honestly be kind and gentle with yourself. :)  You are loved!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am THE WORST about this, as we&#039;ve discussed. I&#039;m weaning myself off. Slowly. VERY slowly. It will happen.
