					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2012/04/27/the-world-doesnt-end/#comment-3615&quot;&gt;encyclocrat&lt;/a&gt;.

I love how Mass Effect can&#039;t win--it&#039;s too open for the narrative to quite work, and not really open enough to provide the sort of experience that a sandbox game does. And it still works, somehow, sort of.

I&#039;m with you though, that I would have loved just one planet, one nebula, one ruin that was there just for its own sake. The wreck of the Normandy comes closest, maybe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I rather liked Mass Effect 2 in terms of its character development of Sheppard&#039;s companions; Sheppard however is barely touched in the trilogy (indeed one of the better parts of the Mass Effect 3 was existential crisis later on in the game). 

What could have connected, or rather stringed all these quests together was showcasing the grandeur of the universe. Mass Effect 1 allowed you step upon planets that had desolate for countless millenniums. This was what you were fighting to prevent. 

That is what Mass Effect 2 did not embrace fully in my opinion.]]></description>
