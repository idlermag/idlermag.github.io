					<description><![CDATA[You described my view on sports in school to a &quot;T&quot;.   

The &quot;Alone&quot; part gets me before a race when I am just standing around without knowing anyone, and after as well (unless my wife/kids have come to cheer me on.)  But during the race, I always feel like I belong - surrounded by other people that are also running their own race.  When I ran in NY, you could say something to the fellow runners nearby, and get some sort of response. IT made me feel like I was part of something.

GREAT finish!  And gaining a memory to hang on to - that shows you ARENT alone out there running!]]></description>
