					<description><![CDATA[Rock solid, and hilarious.  I dumped Ashley after getting real tired of her crap in the third one, and was pleasantly surprised when things started up with Liara (who I&#039;d really grown to love as a character starting with Shadow Broker, and who I&#039;d been lead to believe was out of play, romance wise, due to not having a previous relationship with her).  As the good Commander Bedlam stated above, Liara went a little crazy trying to bring me back to life and to keep my corpse unmolested...  Ashley was just a catty, selfish b*tch about me not calling her while I was dead.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is funny! At least, Liara did her best to do something about your death while the Virmire survivors threw bitch fits hahaha. 

As for me, my bro shep is sticking with Miranda even if mine hooked up with Liara. Sorry, it was just a fling!]]></description>
