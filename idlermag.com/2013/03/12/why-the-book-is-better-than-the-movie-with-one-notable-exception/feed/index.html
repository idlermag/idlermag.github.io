					<description><![CDATA[I just finished Silver Linings Playbook. Honestly I was hugely unimpressed. The screenwriter must have worked some magic because in text, the characters seemed not mentally ill, but mentally deficient. And the football references were tedious to read.  I haven&#039;t seen the film yet, but it was nominated for so many awards that I have high hopes despite how really boring the book on which it is based was.  I will update you.]]></description>
