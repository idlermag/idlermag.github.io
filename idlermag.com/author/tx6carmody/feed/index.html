										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the perfect time and place to discover <em>Kids in the Hall</em>. In 1990, I was ten years old, and had spent the last three of them insomniac, sneaking downstairs, only sometimes with my mom’s grudging permission, to catch bits of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and <em>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</em>.</p>
<p>It was my introduction to sketch and stand-up comedy. It was funny and sarcastic and risky, but it was also, importantly, grown-up, intelligent, polished. I watched Phil Hartman&#8217;s take on Ronald Reagan, live, peeling away the kindly old wrinkled man who’d been President almost as long as I’d been alive to reveal a diabolical mastermind. It dissolved authority. I didn’t know you were allowed to do that.</p>
<p>I wanted more. On Carson, I’d seen George Carlin do ten minutes of stand-up, and convinced Mom to rent his HBO special <em>What Am I Doing In New Jersey?</em> Carlin’s linguistic freedom and disintegrating precision just blew Dennis Miller’s sarcastic cynicism right out of the water. I also convinced her to rent Spike Lee’s <em>Do the Right Thing</em>. We then made the mistake of watching it with my dad.</p>
<p>One glimpse of Rosie Perez’s chest and Dad declared that I was no longer allowed to go to the video store. PG-13 nudity and jokes about sex or farting in <em>Revenge of the Nerds</em> or <em>Blazing Saddles</em> were one thing, but an actual erotic encounter with a foul-mouthed, dark-nippled Puerto Rican girl in a movie that seemed to advocate throwing trash cans through pizzeria windows was simply too much for his ten-year-old son to watch in the family living room with his full knowledge.</p>
<p>Not everyone in the family agreed. Along with taping bootleg cassette copies of a few Public Enemy albums, I probably learned as much listening to my dad and uncle argue about the merits of letting the kids watch <em>Do the Right Thing</em> as I did watching it.</p>
<p>Especially since I’d already had plenty of chances to see exposed nipples, and didn’t know exactly what to do with that exposure anyways. “I just want to see them! And touch them! And some other stuff! And then&#8230; well, I don’t know what happens then!” Is anything quite like that mute adolescent desire?</p>
<p>I knew that there was plenty about the world that I didn’t like &#8212; that things had simply gone very wrong and nobody was willing to say it. I knew I was different from everyone around me at school, who were all navigating ascending puberty by adopting a kind of tribalism of race and gender as certain of its right to bully anyone who seemed different as it was uncertain about everything else. Hip-hop only got me part of the way there. I needed something as smart and broken and skewed and dislocated and new as I felt. And I needed it to be on prime-time broadcast television.</p>
<p>We didn’t have cable, and my parents clamped down on my late-night TV fests, sending me upstairs to read myself to sleep instead. I plowed through paperbacks and old encyclopedias, reading Mark Twain and Dostoyevsky and <em>The Swiss Family Robinson</em> over and over again in torn-cover mass-markets donated to Detroit’s county jail, where Dad worked. In the long run, being condemned to literature was probably a lucky break, too.</p>
<p>TV wasn’t completely lost to me, though. Luckily, I lived in metro Detroit, five big blocks north of the city’s border at 8 Mile Rd, and just a few miles further, over the Ambassador Bridge, the neighboring city of Windsor, Ontario, which broadcast CBC television and radio.</p>
<p>I was at living the border of city and suburb, childhood and adolescence, America and Canada, mainstream and alternative, disaffection and affirmation. So for me in 1990, flipping the knob on my family’s 17” TV and discovering <em>Kids in the Hall</em> on CBC Windsor’s Channel 9 was like wandering into a seedy record shop in 1967 and pulling out <em>The Velvet Underground and Nico</em> from the bins. I wanted to start a band.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I’ve since binged on <em>KitH</em> in waves: first on the CBC in middle school, then in Comedy Central reruns in high school (we got cable! hey!), late-night back-to-back episodes courting a college girlfriend, and again on Netflix today. It’s impossible to list all of the <em>KitH</em> sketches and characters I love, and difficult for me to separate the ones I saw then from those I discovered later.</p>
<p>But I keenly remember Scott Thompson’s Buddy Cole. There are three things that overpower you (or at least overpowered me) about Buddy:</p>
<ol>
<li>His overt sexuality, which I’ll also break down into three parts (little nesting boxes, this): the fact of his homosexuality, his embrace of a gay/queen-ish identity, and his frank discussions of sex itself. (Would I have used those words to describe all those things at ten? No. But I remember all three pieces, because each of them were rare.)</li>
<li>His sheer delight in language, perhaps especially his own. Watch how Buddy doesn’t just craft his words, but reacts to his own jokes and phrases. Listen to Buddy tell a story &#8212; his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ4oMe5bPIw">teenage adventures in Montreal</a> are a good start &#8212; and think about how difficult it is to craft a compelling comic sketch that is all words, all third-person, and how effortless and entertaining it is when Buddy does it.</li>
<li>His intelligence, which could just disintegrate you. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s one of my favorite Buddy monologues, from season one:</p>
<blockquote><p>They say&#8230; That blacks are inferior, because they like to dance and screw around. Excuse me? I love to dance. And as far as I&#8217;m concerned, screwing is next to godliness. And I&#8217;m the smartest person I know. They say that orientals are superior, because they&#8217;re better at math and have smaller families. I guess that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s only a billion people in China. I mean I&#8217;m certainly not having any children. Yet I don&#8217;t hear a lot of people running around touting the superiority of faggots&#8230;well, just *me*.</p>
<p>They say that *whites* are *smarter* than blacks, but dumber than orientals. I guess we&#8217;re just right. Hmm? We&#8217;re the porridge that Goldilocks chose. Not too hot, like those saucy Africans, but not too cold like those chilly Chinese. They say that heterosexuals are better than homosexuals, because we&#8217;re so promiscuous. I guess that means we&#8217;re also black. It makes sense, &#8217;cause we can really dance. And boy, do we understand the blues.</p>
<p>People make fun of me because I lisp. Really. Such a lot of fuss over a few extra s&#8217;s. They say that every different group has their own language. For example, fags say things like &#8220;Girl&#8221;, and &#8220;Sister&#8221;, and &#8220;What&#8217;s her problem?&#8221;. Another example, another example, foxy black mamas. They say things like &#8220;Girl&#8221;, and &#8220;Sister&#8221;, and &#8220;What&#8217;s her problem?&#8221;&#8230;makes ya think. And straight men say things like &#8220;No&#8221;, and &#8220;Too expensive&#8221;, and &#8220;Touchdown&#8221;, and &#8220;Scoooooore!&#8221;. They&#8217;re so together.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s recap, shall we? Blacks are inferior because they supposedly commit more crime and test lower on white people&#8217;s I.Q. tests. I don&#8217;t know about you, but if I was raised in the ghetto, I&#8217;d be out there ripping off whitey and forgetting the capital of Maine. And orientals aren&#8217;t supposed to be as sexually driven as blacks or whites. Hmm, I guess all those tourists who flock to the flesh pots of Bangkok are there for the food. And blacks, because they apparently have larger than usual genitalia, are called stupider. And orientals, because they supposedly have smaller than usual genitalia, are called *smarter*, not cheated. And whites again have perfect wieners and buns. I guess we&#8217;re just smart enough. Smart enough to stay out of trouble, but too dumb to run convenience stores.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what all the fuss is all about, we&#8217;re all just here to find love. I just think the world would be a lot better place if the scientists could keep their slide rules in their pants. It reminds me of something that Yoko Ono once said to Malcolm X in a bistro in Rome. &#8220;Oh the food&#8217;s terrible. But the waiter&#8217;s hilarious.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No trash cans through the window, but he leaves you demolished all the same.</p>
<p>The literary references make no sense, which became a running gag in Buddy’s sketches. It always seems like a joke he’s making only for himself. And that was the point. Buddy is smarter than you. Buddy is always in control. As Scott Thompson says, Buddy was an “alpha queen.” When it’s time to close the bar, he’ll burn the fucking thing down.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Sound of Young America’s Jesse Thorn, Scott Thompson elaborates on <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/scott-thompson-actor-and-comedian-kids-hall-interview-sound-young-america" target="_blank">how radical and unwelcome this was, even to gay audiences</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was very aware that I was out there almost alone, and I knew that I was breaking new ground which can be very exciting, but also can be very painful. I was shocked at the negativity that I got from people, particularly gay men. I got an awful lot of grief from gay men during that time&#8230;</p>
<p>It was mostly really queenie guys that were most upset with me. They were like, I can’t believe that you’re always playing gay men like that; I think it’s very insulting and stereotypical. I would be like, why don’t you play your voice in a tape recorder and listen to it, because they’re ridiculous. People were in denial. It was such a polarized time. AIDS was ravaging the gay community, so there was no room for humor. Everything was so deadly serious and earnest and it was life and death, and I think I was seen by a large proportion of the gay community, particularly the Mandarins &#8212; and I love to use that word &#8212; who lorded over the movement as sell out, or the Uncle Tom, or the enemy.</p>
<p>To this day it’s still painful for me, because for me I’m like, wait a second, what’s wrong with being effeminate, number one, and number two, lots of gay men are effeminate! It’s crazy! No matter how many weights you lift, you still carry your books like a girl. Grow up! Get a grip! Accept it! I think people were in such a &#8212; it was such a terrible time that Buddy Cole was seen as the enemy. At least Buddy is sexual, he was not neutered, he was never a neutered gay guy. And he was smart! He’s smarter than I am. That queen up until then &#8212; they were always stupid and you laughed at them, and you never laughed at Buddy, Buddy was always in control. He was an alpha queen. I couldn’t understand it; to this day I think they were dead wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t be a queen like Buddy &#8212; I knew I was hopelessly condemned to teenage heterosexuality long before Rosie Perez publicly confirmed it &#8212; and I couldn’t be Canadian. But then, I couldn’t be as smart, as charitable, as self-controlled, or as fearless as he was either. But those virtues, at least, were something I could work on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In “What Novels Can Do That Films Can’t (And Vice Versa),” Seymour Chatman argues that in film, “the dominant mode is presentational, not assertive. A film doesn’t say, ‘This is the state of affairs,’ it merely shows you that state of affairs.” </p>
<p>Consider a key scene in Vittorio De Sica’s 1948 <em>Ladri di Bicyclette</em> (Bicycle Thieves). Antonio Ricci, the protagonist, takes his wife Maria to pawn their bedsheets, in order to reclaim his in-hock bicycle, which he needs for a new job. The sheets are part of Maria’s trousseau or dowry gift. They’re not Antonio’s to give. </p>
<p>By trading the sheets for the bicycle, the Riccis exchange one overdetermined object for another, belonging to economies separated according to exterior and interior, male and female, future and past. All they share is a common exchange-value. But more is required than just swapping them for money: the objects themselves must be transformed, made as abstract as money itself. </p>
<p>Maria removes the sheets from the bed, washes them, and bundles them up. (“Trousseau” literally means “truss” or “bundle.”) She also negotiates their exchange, and convinces the counter employee to pay 7500 rather than 7000 lire. But this is crucial: they’re not sold. Instead, they’re collateral for a loan, just as Antonio’s bicycle was. The intent is always to buy them back with his new wages.</p>
<p>Antonio has a receipt for his bicycle, and reclaims it from another clerk at another window. As he walks away from the camera to match the number on the receipt with the number on the bicycle, we nearly miss another employee crossing in front. Here the script reads (in English translation): “In the foreground, a man with a bundle of sheets, passes.” We have no way of knowing whether these are Maria’s, although we are asked to associate this scene with the rest of their story. </p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6509" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/10/a-broken-world-of-bedsheets-and-bicycles/bicycle-thief/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png" data-orig-size="419,308" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bicycle thief" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=419" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=640" alt="the wall of shelves" title="bicycle thief"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-6509" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png 419w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=150 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/bicycle-thief.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px" /> “Pan with him until he reaches a beehive of sheets filled from floor to ceiling with sheets,” the script continues. “With some skill he climbs about half-way up the wall of shelves where he deposits the newly arrived bundle.” </p>
<p>The script does not specify the height or breadth of the wall, or the number of shelves; in the film the wall is preposterously huge, probably thirty feet high. No other set on the film (with the possible exception of the market at the Plaza Vittorio) is nearly as elaborately or dramatically built. The shelves make approximately 3’ by 5’ units that sprawl around the room, extending off-camera in both directions, each crammed with dozens of bundles. </p>
<p>The economic gambit Antonio and Maria have made is simple: exchange the trousseau for the bicycle, the bicycle for the job, which will in turn allow them to reclaim the trousseau. The sheer number of trousseaus is evidence that this economy, like so many of the other economies of misery encountered in the film &#8212; the employment office, the police station, the workers’ guild, the market, the church &#8212; is broken. As Mark West writes, “the whole country seems to have hocked great masses of household goods.” What’s received never adds up to what is paid; victims must track down their own stolen goods, which in turn are brought to market, but never sold. </p>
<p>The size of the wall, especially in contrast to the small, neat row of bicycles, suggests less orderly classification than the impossibility of comprehension. Narrative film collapses into pure photography. The futility of containing the entire shot within the frame, even with a panning camera, mirrors the futility of Antonio and Maria’s situation. It does not matter at all whether the particular bundle being carefully (or not so carefully) stowed away belongs to them. </p>
<p>The personal narrative of pawning the trousseau and reclaiming the bicycle is unmasked as a potentially infinite iteration. There is nothing irreplaceable about this family: the story of <em>Bicycle Thieves</em> could belong to anyone. </p>
<p>Indeed, after the bicycle is stolen, after a fruitless search, Antonio himself is caught at the end of the film stealing a lone bicycle. This is why the film has the plural title <em>Ladri di bicyclette</em>. There isn’t only one thief in the film, but many; not one story of loss, but countless stories that go untold.</p>
<p>In many ways, though, I still prefer the mistranslation <em>Bicycle Thief</em>, which is how you will find the film listed on Netflix, to the more literal <em>Bicycle Thieves</em>. The key is to see it not as a definite reference, but an abstract position anyone might occupy given the right circumstances. </p>
<p>There are no collective nouns &#8212; just a series of isolated and interchangable parts. That’s the story Antonio’s bicycle and Maria’s bedsheets tell in their own fragmented way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>There are two snow sleds in <em>Citizen Kane</em>. The first, as everyone knows, is named Rosebud and is given to Kane by his mother; the second is a Christmas present from Kane&#8217;s guardian, Thatcher, and is seen so briefly that audiences are unaware that it, too, has a name. If you press the pause button the DVD edition of <em>Kane</em>, you will discover that for a few frames sled number two, which is called Crusader, is presented fully to the camera. Where the original has a flower, this one is embossed with the helmet of a knight. The symbolism is fairly obvious: Kane repays Thatcher&#8217;s gift by growing up to be a crusading, trust-busting newspaperman, out to slay the dragon Wall Street. Deprived of maternal care, he turns himself into a phony champion of the people, an overreacher who dies like a medieval knight amid the empty gothic splendor of Xanadu.</p>

<p>The solution to the mystery is supposed to be that we, like Kane’s friends, lovers, and confidantes, discover that “the great man” is actually hollow inside. There is nothing there &#8212; no lost love, no moral truths, no imparted wisdom. “Rosebud” is just a missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle. It has no special value other than that it is missing. Kane the man, like <em>Kane</em> the film, is what Borges called it: a labyrinth without a center. </p>
<p>William Randolph Hearst was embarrassed by Rosebud, too, but he took the word a great deal more seriously than Welles. The persistent rumor has always been that “Rosebud” was Hearst’s nickname for his mistress Marion Davies and/or her clitoris. The “flower” image on Kane’s sled looks positively like a labia and clitoris. </p>
<p>Herman Mankiewicz was a friend of Hearst’s and Davies’s, and presumably knew what “Rosebud” meant; regardless, Hearst saw both name and film as a betrayal. “The Hearst press is under strict orders to ignore Welles,” <em>The New Yorker</em> reported in 1941, “except for a series of articles pointing out that he is a menace to American motherhood, freedom of speech and assembly, and the pursuit of happiness.”</p>
<p>Mankiewicz’s brother Joseph would later tell film critic Andrew Sarris that “Rosebud” was the name of a bike that Herman lost as a child in Wilkes-Barre, PA. This position has never gained traction; that no one has much been interested in Mankiewicz as Kane’s “author” may be the only thing Sarris and his nemesis Pauline Kael ever agreed on.</p>
<p>Instead, Kane is nearly always a stand-in for Hearst or Welles. Or better still, both &#8212; especially as each, through <em>Citizen Kane</em>, has come to define the other.</p>
<p>Never mind that the two were quite different &#8212; and both believed they were quite different from Kane. In his autobiography, Welles relates how he once found himself alone in an elevator with Hearst. It was the night of <em>Citizen Kane</em>&#8216;s 1941 San Francisco premiere, and Welles invited him to the opening. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t answer. And as he was getting off at his floor, I said, &#8216;Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.'&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>If we take the Welles/Borges argument seriously, then “Rosebud” doesn’t lend the film any substance, but a structure. Its structure is one of substitution, exchange, or replacement. “Rosebud” is replaced by “Crusader;” the Inquirer’s crusading troublemakers are replaced by the Chronicle’s establishment staff; Kane’s first wife, an aristocrat, is replaced by his mistress, “a cross-section of the American public.”</p>
<p>When this wife leaves him, she’s replaced by her tchotchkes, jigsaw puzzles, and snow globes. It’s one of these, not his supposedly beloved childhood sled, that Kane clutches both times he utters “Rosebud” &#8212; first when she leaves, then again at his death. </p>
<p>Kane is an indiscriminate collector of people and things. He buys priceless ancient statues by the gross and never opens their crates. At the end of the film, a clerk reads from a catalog of everything Kane has ever owned, as Thompson’s photographers document “the junk as well as the art.” </p>
<p>Assembling so many priceless and worthless objects without a corresponding order actually flattens their value. Kane’s staff burns great piles of it, including the sled &#8212; still crated together with the contents of his mother’s auctioned-off home &#8212; just to make some sense of it.</p>
<p>Kane is always exchanging substance for structure, value for trash and back again. His inherited wealth comes from the deed to a silver mine thought worthless, given to his mother in lieu of payment. </p>
<p>“I’m not interested in gold mines, oil wells, shipping, or real estate,” a young Kane tells Thatcher. Instead of squandering his fortune on the newspaper, he transforms it into a media empire. Instead of inherited wealth issuing forth from the earth, he uses his newspapers, radio stations, grocery stores, and paper mills, to create value from nothing. (That news empire, in turn, is swept aside by magazines and film; as Kane is chased by Thompson, so Hearst was chased by Henry Luce, the gas lamp replaced by the electric light.)</p>
<p>Kane’s goal is self-invention, without obligation to anyone or anything, even reality. “If the headline is big enough, it makes the news big enough,” he tells the Inquirer’s staff. When his first wife tries to impose boundaries on his behavior, he shows his true ambitions:  </p>
<blockquote><p>EMILY: People will think&#8211;<br />
CHARLES: What I tell them to think.</p></blockquote>
<p>His gifts to others, though, are always a snare. “You’ve never given me anything I really wanted,” Susan complains. “You want to be loved &#8212; that&#8217;s all you want! I&#8217;m Charles Foster Kane. Whatever you want &#8212; just name it and it&#8217;s yours! But you&#8217;ve gotta love me!”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s why he went into politics,” Kane’s discarded friend Jed Leland tells Thompson. “It seems we weren&#8217;t enough, he wanted all the voters to love him too. Guess all he really wanted out of life was love. That&#8217;s Charlie&#8217;s story, how he lost it. You see, he just didn&#8217;t have any to give.”</p>

<p>After Kane loses the race for governor, after refusing to be blackmailed by either the political boss Geddes or his wife Emily &#8212; “Fraud At Polls!” leads the Inquirer &#8212; Leland confronts him, drunk. Kane’s progressivism is a sham front for his own narcissism. “You talk about the people as though you owned them, as though they belong to you,” Leland complains. “As long as I can remember, you&#8217;ve talked about giving the people their rights, as if you can make them a present of Liberty, as a reward for services rendered. </p>
<p>“You used to write an awful lot about the workingman,” Leland charges. “He&#8217;s turning into something called organized labor. You&#8217;re not going to like that one little bit when you find out it means that your workingman expects something is his right, not as your gift!</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you love &#8217;em so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. Something to be played your way, according to your rules.”</p>
<p>“A toast, Jedediah, to love on my terms,” Kane replies, finally taking a drink. “Those are the only terms anybody ever knows &#8212; his own.”</p>
<p>“He never gave himself away,” an older Leland remembers. “He never gave anything away, he just left you a tip, hmm?” he laughs.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When anthropologist Marcel Mauss studied the gift economies of Pacific Islanders and the potlatch culture of the American Northwest, he found that none of these peoples renowned for their generosity ever actually gave anything away. Instead, these “gifts” bound together both parties, whether individuals or nations, through mutual obligation. It does not matter whether the gifts are objectively worthless &#8212; beads, tokens, shells, paper script. What matters is the commitments they represent.</p>
<p>If I trade with you, A for B, straight up, our relationship is finished when the sale is completed. If I give you A outright, you give me, implicitly or explicitly, the right to call on you in the future. We stand in a definite and perpetual relationship to each other, even after the debt is discharged. (Besides Citizen Kane, this is also the structuring principle of The Godfather, The Odyssey, and many more besides.) </p>
<p>This implies two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The gift economy’s so-called primitive form of exchange actually enables richer and more complex social bonds than pure monetary exchange or barter, with which it uneasily co-exists, even in capitalism. This was Mauss’s conclusion, which became one of the foundational principles of modern anthropology.</li>
<li>The so-called “pure gift,” a gift without expectation of reciprocity, is impossible. The only thing that can be given is time, which is no “thing” at all. This was philosopher Jacques Derrida’s conclusion, and this “condition of impossibility” became one of the late foundational principles of deconstruction.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Citizen Kane</em> helps us see a third conclusion. I think it’s the conclusion Kane reaches after he destroys Susan’s room, pausing only when he finds the snow globe on the floor. It’s the hidden structural meaning of “Rosebud.”  Let’s call it the Ecclesiastical conclusion.</p>
<p>What Kane sees, as his mirrored reflection is doubled and redoubled across the cinema screen, is the fundamental contingency of all value: the realization that the statues as well as the souvenirs, the love of trophy wives and lost mothers, are equally worthless. That even when we reject what poses as the inherent value silver or love in favor of a fiction we orchestrate ourselves, that fiction is doomed to end in failure. The miser cannot stand apart.</p>
<p>We can shout and rage, but our cardboard lies collapse with just a tiny push. At the end, all that is left is a whispered voice and broken glass.</p>

On May 16, manager Sparky Anderson appeared on the CBS Morning News with owner Tom Monaghan. It wasn&#8217;t their first national interview: ever since Jack Morris no-noed the White Sox in Chicago live on NBC to go 4-0, everyone had wanted to talk to Sparky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again the same questions,&#8221; Sparky complained. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, though; the nation is getting to know the Detroit Tigers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sparky presciently kept a daily diary for the 1984 season, which was published as <em>Bless You Boys</em> after the Tigers won the World Series. On May 16, after the news interview, the Tigers beat the Mariners 10-1 to go 29-5 for the season. It wasn&#8217;t just the winning that made the team special, but the combination of grace and tenacity with which they played. Center fielder Chet Lemon coined a saying in April that became the team&#8217;s motto: &#8220;We mad and they don&#8217;t even know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the 16th, Sparky writes about Alan Trammell&#8217;s sore shoulder and Milt Wilcox&#8217;s pitching, how Aurelio Lopez and Willie Hernandez brought it home. But he also writes that he &#8220;couldn&#8217;t really enjoy the game&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>My daughter, Shirlee, called to tell me about Daddy. There&#8217;s a large tumor on his lung. She cried like a baby on the phone. I told Shirlee to say a prayer to herself and somehow, Grandpa will know.</p>
<p>I have to admit I felt like crying myself. I know why I love Daddy so much. He had no education and he was only a laborer, but everything he did, he did for his family.</p>
<p>Here I am on top of the baseball mountain, but without this one man who never went to school and never had any money, I would never be where I am.</p></blockquote>
<p>His father would have an operation to remove the tumor from his lung the next day: 11AM in California, 2PM in Detroit. Sparky closes the day&#8217;s diary entry with &#8220;Please, God, help the doctors work this out.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sparky Anderson was 50 years old when he wrote that. The year before, on April 6, his son Albert was in a horrible accident. Sparky writes about that, too, on its anniversary:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was on this day in 1983 when my son, Albert, drove off a cliff and fell 800 feet to the bottom of a canyon back home in California. He was unconscious for nine hours. Then, miraculously, he woke up and walked home. He had a broken sternum and cuts all over his body, but we were thankful he suffered no brain damage or internal injuries.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way he should be here now&mdash;but God saved him. I told Albert that April sixth changed his daddy&#8217;s life. I went home and looked down that canyon. I remember looking up and saying, &#8220;God, I don&#8217;t know why you spared him, but I tell You this has changed my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>I want to win as much as anyone. But nothing about this game will ever bother me after that. I get upset over a loss now, but only for the moment. I think I&#8217;m a much stronger person for that.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tigers beat the White Sox in the Sox&#8217;s home opener that day&mdash;in those first nine games, they beat everyone in their home opener&mdash;and Morris no-hit them the next day.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On May 17, the Tigers were off. Sparky waited for word from California about his father.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think about when your Daddy is dying? How do you keep your mind on anything else?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the best entry in the book.</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought about playing ball across the street when Ralph&#8217;s Market parking lot was the best stadium in the world. I remember how Daddy threw to me on the lawn and pulled so hard for us when we played American Legion ball. I even remembered when we lived in Bridgewater, South Dakota, next to the jail that was never locked.</p>
<p>The two o&#8217;clock operation never came. Instead there was a phone call from Mama. The sound of her voice told the whole story. Before the operation began, Daddy&#8217;s heart gave out. He fell back on the table. He didn&#8217;t suffer at all, and that would have made him happy. Daddy didn&#8217;t want anyone to worry about him.</p>
<p>He never hurt a soul. He always told me, &#8220;Be nice to people. It&#8217;ll never cost you a dime. Courtesy and honesty are free.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget that lesson. I&#8217;ll never be able to talk with Daddy or see his face again. But I&#8217;ll never lose him.</p>
<p>Daddy is dead. He was 74.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sparky and his wife Carol flew to California that night, leaving the team in the hands of pitching coach Roger Craig. They went 3-0 against the Oakland A&#8217;s in Detroit, with the first game cut short because of rain and the second two decided by just one run each. Sparky writes, &#8220;I checked on the Tiger score, just to see who won. We beat the A&#8217;s, and I knew Daddy would have liked that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sparky joined the team in Anaheim, where they won three straight against the Angels to go 35-5. In between, the Tigers played Sparky&#8217;s old team, the Reds, in an AL-NL exhibition game. He won two titles with the Big Red Machine, and then was fired, and he was still mad about it. Detroit played all backup players and won 3-2; instead of gloating, he quietly observes, &#8220;That sure shows our depth.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In between, too, was his father&#8217;s funeral. Sparky&#8217;s dad was buried in a Detroit shirt with a blue Tiger emblem and a championship ring he&#8217;d worn since 1949. Sparky had received it for being batboy on the Hollywood Stars&#8217; Pacific Coast League championship team.</p>
<p>In the 30s and 40s, long before the American and National Leagues came to California, the Pacific Coast League was amazing, producing stars<br />
like Joe Dimaggio, Ted Williams, and others. Without the PCL, Sparky would never have played ball in the parking lot at Ralph&#8217;s, would never have played for the Stars&#8217; archrival Los Angeles Angels, and never would have dreamed that he would eventually play a year of Major League Baseball, starting at second base for the Philadelphia Phillies, before returning to the minors and then coaching. He wouldn&#8217;t have even been Sparky&mdash;he would have only been George. The name his father gave him, by which everyone outside of baseball knew him.</p>
<p>At the funeral, Sparky&#8217;s mother (who he calls Mama) whispered to his father, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss you, Ole Pal.&#8221; Sparky reports this and writes, &#8220;I knew what friendship was all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>***<br />
Sparky Anderson died today, in California. He was 76 years old.</p>
<p>Sparky won his second back-to-back championship with the Reds in 1976. He liked finding little parallels like that. They made him feel lucky. They made him feel comforted. They made him feel sure.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to miss you, Ole Pal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<em>Chappelle's Show</em> is a strange hybrid. The cinematic clips uproot it from the live experience, but the recorded audience pulls it back down again. The big laughs are all things that a 2004 audience found funny or shocking. And some of them just aren't that funny or shocking any more.

On top of this, so many of Chappelle's sketches have become comedy classics that it's hard to genuinely find them surprising anymore. "I'm Rick James, bitch!" was hilarious. Then your mom's skeezy brother said it ten times at one holiday party a year after the show aired, and it didn't feel so funny anymore.

<em>Chappelle's Show</em> also gets bound up with what we know about Dave Chappelle's history afterward. Dave famously quit the show because he felt that he was creatively tapped and was increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that jokes he'd intended as racial satire were getting laughed at for their silly, minstrelsy qualities. He even felt that his co-creators were complicit in this—he no longer felt comfortable working with them, so after recording several sketches for a much-anticipated third season, he briefly disappeared. There were rumors about his mental health and the possibility of drug abuse. Nobody could seem to grasp that somebody so successful didn't like what he was doing anymore.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally figured out what had been bothering me about rewatching <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> on Netflix.</p>
<p>It was the laughter.</p>

Dave and his partners would write and perform prerecorded sketches, then Dave would show them to a live audience. A few shows, like <em>Saturday Night Live</em> or <em>The Daily Show</em>, do this for a handful of sketches. On <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em>, that was the entire show.</p>
<p>When it worked, it was fantastic. Sketches on <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> were downright cartoonish—Dave could get punched so hard that he&#8217;d flip end over end like Daffy Duck, or crap so hard that he would launch off the toilet bowl like a rocket ship. (An understated allusion to a legendary lost Marvin the Martian short.) They were surprising and cinematic, and the live audience would register that. And when Dave&#8217;s sense of humor was shocking or childish or startlingly truthful, the audience would register that, too.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, that recording a live audience freezes a show in time. If you&#8217;re watching a movie, let&#8217;s say an older but still-contemporary-feeling comedy, like Woody Allen&#8217;s <em>Annie Hall</em>, you can laugh at whatever you like; the clichés that might have killed in 1977 just wash over you. The same is true of animated shows like <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Futurama</em>, or <em>King of the Hill</em>.</p>
<p>The live audience is really an artifact of the live, three-camera sitcom—think <em>I Love Lucy</em>, <em>The Cosby Show</em>, or <em>Seinfeld</em>. When sitcoms went single-camera and were edited together like movies—think <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>, <em>The Bernie Mac Show</em>, <em>Arrested Development</em>, <em>The Office</em>, or <em>30 Rock</em>— they gave up on the live audience AND the laugh track.</p>
<p>So <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> is a strange hybrid. The cinematic clips uproot it from that live experience, but the recorded audience pulls it back down again. The big laughs are all things that a 2004 audience found funny or shocking. And some of them just aren&#8217;t that funny or shocking six years after the fact.</p>
<p>On top of this, so many of Chappelle&#8217;s sketches have become comedy classics that it&#8217;s hard to genuinely find them surprising. &#8220;I&#8217;m Rick James, bitch!&#8221; was hilarious. Then your mom&#8217;s skeezy brother said it ten times at one holiday party a year after the show aired, and it didn&#8217;t feel so funny.</p>
<p><em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> also gets bound up with what we know about Dave Chappelle&#8217;s history afterward. Dave famously quit the show because he felt that he was creatively tapped and was increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that jokes he&#8217;d intended as racial satire were getting laughed at for their silly, minstrelsy qualities. He even felt that his co-creators were complicit in this—he no longer felt comfortable working with them, so after recording several sketches for a much-anticipated third season, he briefly disappeared. There were rumors about his mental health and the possibility of drug abuse. Nobody could seem to grasp that somebody so successful didn&#8217;t like what he was doing anymore.</p>
<p>They should have seen the signs. An unusual number of sketches—even some whole episodes—are devoted to Dave&#8217;s fantasy of quitting his successful show. In one long riff, Dave finds out he&#8217;s impregnated Oprah Winfrey, so he spectacularly quits his show, punching out Comedy Central staffers and pulling down cubicles. Of course, it turns out Dave isn&#8217;t really the father, so he&#8217;s stuck without a job OR Oprah&#8217;s money.</p>

This episode along with the Charlie Murphy/Rick James episode were probably the most famous from the second season, so I feel pretty comfortable spoiling its conceit for you. Wayne Brady, despite his smiling, singing exterior, turns out to be a gun-toting, drug-dealing pimp and murderer.</p>
<p>I watched the episode for about twenty minutes before I remembered that it was a parody of the Denzel Washington movie <em>Training Day</em>. Do you remember Denzel in <em>Training Day</em>? I kinda do&#8230; but I know I remember Wayne Brady spoofing Denzel&#8217;s performance more. And even Wayne Brady isn&#8217;t the same guy he used to be. Between <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> and appearances on <em>30 Rock</em>, <em>Girlfriends</em>, and elsewhere, he&#8217;s more than just the singing guy from <em>Whose Line Is It Anyway?</em> But he&#8217;s also hosting <em>Let&#8217;s Make A Deal</em>. It&#8217;s weird.</p>
<p>The things I found the funniest were jokes that nobody laughed at—little inside references that you have to pick up by watching the show several episodes in a clip, or strange, timeless jokes. For instance, in the Rick James episode, Charlie Murphy relates how he and his brother beat Rick after he&#8217;d dragged mud-stained boots over Eddie&#8217;s couch. Charlie remembers Eddie saying, &#8220;Wow, Rick really needs help&#8230;&#8221; Only for Charlie to come back, &#8220;Yo, we just GAVE him some help!&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing topical about it; it&#8217;s a joke that I&#8217;m sure was funny when Charlie told it in 1984, and it&#8217;s funny today.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that Comedy Central drove Chappelle&#8217;s formula into the ground, first with blatantly offensive ethnic comedians with infinitely less talent (I&#8217;m looking at you, Carlos Mencia) and then with the sometimes-funny, frequently-embarassing &#8220;Lost Episodes&#8221; from what would have been <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> Season 3. If the live-presentation formula is cumbersome with Dave presenting sketches, it&#8217;s positively uncomfortable when Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings try to stand in Dave&#8217;s place. They make awkward jokes, usually at Dave&#8217;s expense, give an excessively literal and thoroughly clumsy summary of the sketch we&#8217;re about to see, then throw it up on the screen.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t good moments in these third-season sketches. My favorite is, in a weird way, a kind of self-commentary on the postmortem nature of the show—<a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/videos/index.jhtml?videoId=71416&amp;title=tupac-is-still-alive" target="new">an extended joke about Tupac Shakur&#8217;s posthumous records</a>.</p>
<p>Dave is in the club, dancing with a crowd, listening to one of these unreleased Tupac recordings, when Tupac starts making references to events after his death, like George W. Bush&#8217;s election, then covering it over with lines like &#8220;when I say George W, I mean a George W. Smith, for city council here in Oakland&#8230; you probably didn&#8217;t hear about it.&#8221; The chorus for the song turns out to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wrote this song a long time ago<br />
A real long time ago<br />
Feel me!<br />
I wrote this song a long time ago<br />
It was the dopest song I ever wrote<br />
In &#8217;94</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone in the club starts exchanging strange looks, until Tupac&#8217;s lyrics begin to start commenting on the appearance and behavior of everyone there. &#8220;Go home!&#8221; Tupac tells Dave. &#8220;I&#8217;m not alive!&#8221;</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="395" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2010/09/09/when-the-laughter-stopped/attachment/01/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg" data-orig-size="480,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="0[1]" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=480" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Dave Chappelle" title="0[1]" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-395" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/01.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />To me, that says so much about what&#8217;s still funny, but also a little creepy, about watching <em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em> in 2010. <em>A joke about Tupac being alive? Didn&#8217;t that get old when I was still in high school? </em></p>
<p>But Dave Chappelle is our comedy Tupac. He wasn&#8217;t shot (except by Wayne Brady in that sketch), but he vanished just as quickly. He did so much, so fast, that we forgive him for the times that he wasn&#8217;t so great, and are willing to accept the dribs and drabs, the poorly-edited outtakes, because it&#8217;s all we have left. And we&#8217;re still waiting for word that he just might still be around, under the radar, without an audience, working on something great.</p>
<p>The audience&#8217;s laughter bothers me. It was what bothered Dave, too, so much that he left it all behind when he was still on top.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The decade's five best, most influential comedies are all on Netflix's "Watch Instantly" online streaming service. What are the odds?

In this short series, I'm going to watch each of them&#8212;notice I'm using the future tense, even though I've totally gone back and watched all of these&#8212;and pick them off and break them down one by one. How have they held up? What do we learn about them (and about us) by rewatching them? I'll also pull in some additional commentary&#8212;some from earlier in the decade, some later&#8212;that helps offer some perspective on (re)watching these series. And I'll definitely be letting you know what I think, offering my take on how we got here.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Gavin and Kev asked me to write something about pop culture, I knew exactly what I wanted my column to be about: old TV. Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, BitTorrent, iTunes, Amazon, DVDs, old cassette tapes I recorded as a kid &#8212; I eat it all up.</p>
<p>The stars have aligned. The last decade&#8217;s five best, most influential comedies are all on Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Watch Instantly&#8221; online streaming service.</p>
<p>I know. You&#8217;re guessing. For the record, here are the five I&#8217;m thinking of, in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Futurama</em></li>
<li><em>The Office</em> (UK)</li>
<li><em>Chappelle&#8217;s Show</em></li>
<li><em>Arrested Development</em></li>
<li><em>30 Rock</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, yes: a complete list of the decade&#8217;s best comedies would have to include (definitely) <em>The Daily Show</em> and (probably) <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>. But <em>The Daily Show</em> is available on <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/">Comedy Central&#8217;s own competing site</a>, and HBO holds on to their original series like they&#8217;re money. Because they are.</p>
<p>This is the best Netflix could do. Once you add in <em>South Park</em>,<em> King of the Hill</em>, the US/Steve Carell version of <em>The Office</em>, and terrific runs of older classics like <em>SNL</em>, <em>Monty Python</em>, and <em>Soap</em>, plus cult hits like <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> and the <em>Kids in the Hall</em> pilot, you&#8217;re talking a serious stash of the funny.</p>
<p>Out of this shortlist, besides the just-now-airing new episodes of <em>Futurama</em>, <em>30 Rock</em> is the only show that doesn&#8217;t have the entire series available online. (Once Season 5 starts airing, I bet we&#8217;ll see Season 4 in the queue too.) And even though it&#8217;s probably the most universally well-regarded sitcom on TV now &#8212; it&#8217;s definitely my favorite &#8212; in terms of influence and originality, <em>30 Rock</em> is fifth out of five. I love the show, I could quote and rewatch it endlessly, but you could make a good case that all it&#8217;s really done is mix and match elements of the other four. Liz Lemon is equal parts Michael Bluth and Turanga Leela, with a dash of Homer Simpson. We get to watch her spin her wheels in her workplace, which is filled with dweebs, losers, cartoons, and ethnic stereotypes. Sounding familiar?</p>

<p>Odds are, if you&#8217;re a fan at all, you probably remember most of these episodes of <em>30 Rock</em> pretty well. Or you&#8217;re trying/hoping to catch up. Even if you don&#8217;t watch the show, you know a lot about it; your friends watch it, you see commercials, it&#8217;s still in the atmosphere. But with any of the other four comedies, it&#8217;s likely that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>You saw them and enjoyed them, but don&#8217;t remember any of the episodes well beyond a few big moments;</li>
<li>You heard about them and maybe wanted to watch, or watch more often, but wound up missing them altogether;</li>
<li>They&#8217;re your favorite comedy ever, you&#8217;ve memorized your favorite episodes, and you&#8217;re delighted that someone is finally asking you to talk about them rather than begging you to stop; OR</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t like any of them. In which case, I don&#8217;t like you. Get the hell out of here and go watch Season 3 of <em>Heroes</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this short series, I&#8217;m going to watch* and write about each of them, picking them off and breaking them down one by one.</p>
<p>*Notice I&#8217;m using the future tense for &#8220;watch&#8221;, even though I&#8217;ve totally gone back and watched all of these and am already on my second run through <em>Arrested Development</em>.</p>
<p>How have these shows held up? What do we learn about them (and about us) by rewatching them?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also pull in some additional commentary—some from earlier in the decade, contemporary with these show&#8217;s airdates, and some from later—that can give us some perspective while (re)watching these series.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll definitely be letting you know what I think, offering my take on how we got here.</p>
<p>But in this first post, just to set the stage, and so everyone knows the baseline we&#8217;re starting from, I&#8217;m going to turn it over to you in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;ve never seen / are a total geek for one of them, out yourselves.</li>
<li>What do you remember or not remember, like or dislike in these shows?</li>
<li>Where would <em>you</em> rank them?</li>
<li>Also—where would the 2004 version of yourself rank them?</li>
</ul>
<p>As we&#8217;ve changed, the world&#8217;s changed, and comedy&#8217;s changed, this turns out to be a more meaningful question that you might think.</p>
