										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recent video game film, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> (2012), has been called by some &#8220;the best video game movie ever made.&#8221; On the surface, that sounds like quite the endorsement, but if you dig deeper, such a title doesn&#8217;t carry much weight when you look at the rest of the sample in question.</p>
<p>In short, it is almost like calling <em>Rambo III</em> (1988) &#8220;the best Rambo-goes-to-Afghanistan movie ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s an exaggeration, but not far from the mark.</p>
<p>The original <em>Tron</em> (1982) is perhaps the only other video game film worthy of battling <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> for the title of &#8220;best video game ever,&#8221; because let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; most video game movies ain&#8217;t that good.</p>
<p>One would think, with plenty of captivating stories played out on home consoles every day, making a great video game movie would be easy. For some reason it is not.</p>
<p>Why? I don&#8217;t know, maybe, unlike <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, most video game films don&#8217;t embrace their video-gameness. <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not, which is the Achilles&#8217; heel of most video game films. <em>Resident Evil</em> (2002)? How do you screw up a special forces team fighting zombies in a spooky mansion?</p>
<p><em>Street Fighter</em> (1994)? That is worthy of its own article. Man, I waited <em>in line</em> on opening night to see that turkey.</p>
<p>And then there is the gold standard of failed video game films: <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> (1993).</p>
<p>I confess to <strong>a)</strong> seeing <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in the theater on opening weekend and <strong>b)</strong> owning the DVD.</p>
<p>Yes, years later, as an adult, I made the conscious decision to own the film.</p>
<p>Is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8220;good&#8221;? That depends on what one considers good. Story-wise, no, not really. It&#8217;s just strange. Entertainment-wise, yes, because it is so ridiculous. Get some beers, call over your friends, and put on <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> &#8212; there is no way you don&#8217;t enjoy yourselves.</p>
<p>Plus, Mojo Nixon <a title="video on youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4_nFgY7PZA">has a cameo</a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4_nFgY7PZA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>Why is <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> <b>so</b> strange? Because it didn&#8217;t embrace its video-gameness. The film tries to explain the <em>hows</em> and <em>whys</em> of the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> universe, which is its biggest mistake &#8212; but it is also the reason why it is so hilarious.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the film in a vacuum. If the screenwriters were told &#8220;try to explain how this universe with King Koopa and mushroom people could really happen,&#8221; they made quite the effort. An asteroid knocking dinosaurs into a parallel dimension, where they evolved into humanoids? OK.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great for an episode of <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Sliders</em>, but it doesn&#8217;t really belong in a movie about <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need realistic explanations for plumbers growing into giants or shooting fireballs at angry turtles as they try to save a princess. People accept <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> for what it is: <b>fantasy</b>.</p>
<p>And this is how <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> earned its many praises: it ups the fantasy and doesn&#8217;t try to be something it is not. There isn&#8217;t any screen time devoted to <i>why</i> the video game characters are &#8220;alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>They just <i>are</i>, and that is good enough for me.</p>
<p>But, on some level, I am glad <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> tried to be as serious as it is &#8212; otherwise, I may not have one of my favorite bad movies to watch with friends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It probably says a lot about me that the first show I ever recorded with a DVR was ALF. No, not some new reboot. The <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JDUBE2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001JDUBE2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank">original show from the 1980s</a>. Yes, I now have access to a state of the art TV recording device, and I use it to record sitcom reruns.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p>Like most who share my 31 years, I grew up watching ALF. I remember watching reruns after school as a kid. This might explain how I developed my own smart-mouth sarcastic humor (and perhaps, my fondness for cats). As a kid, the show&#8217;s draw was it had a puppet. But, as an adult, I get much, much more of the humor and enjoy its brilliant absurdity.</p>
<p>OK, and I still like that it has a puppet.</p>
<p>I watched a favorite episode the other day &#8212; where the Tanners throw a Halloween party, and ALF shows up with a zipper taped to his chest to pass off as a guest (<a href="http://alf.wikia.com/wiki/Some_Enchanted_Evening" target="_blank">“Some Enchanted Evening”</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still laughing about it. Yes, it was a cheesy, simple gag, but I loved it. The visual is hilarious on two levels &#8212; the zipper looks totally out of place, and ALF interacting with a room full of adults, instead of just the Tanners, really puts the focus on his shortness.</p>
<p>Ah, <em>sitcoms</em>.</p>
<p>The episode also has one of my favorite comedic reversals. I&#8217;m paraphrasing here, but it goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Willie: Where did you get that zipper?</p>
<p>ALF: You know that old jacket you&#8217;ve been meaning to throw out?</p>
<p>Willie: Yeah.</p>
<p>ALF: Well, you might wanna hang on to it. I ripped this out of your new raincoat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! Classic.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care much for sitcoms these days, but I will always watch ALF when I can. Maybe it is the connection to my youth, or maybe it is the humor.</p>
<p>Or maybe, just maybe, I like smart-mouth puppets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eddie Murphy has made plenty of odd films. But, at least his odd film of the 1980s was odd in an interesting way, not because he wore a fat suit.</p>
<p><a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305310351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=6305310351&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>The Golden Child</em></a> (1986) is odd, because it blends action, comedy, fantasy, and elements of Chinese mysticism.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Yes, <a title="on Amazon." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QUCQX8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QUCQX8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20"><em>Big Trouble in Little China</em></a> has all of those things too (and they came out the same year).</p>
<p>But, only one of these films has Eddie Murphy, and that is the big difference (even though Kurt Russel is great in <em>Big Trouble</em>). I have read <em>The Golden Child</em> was <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Child#Production_details">originally planned</a> as a very serious adventure film, but when Murphy was brought on, it switched gears.</p>
<p>So, now you have Eddie Murphy fighting demons, traveling to Tibet, and searching for magical weapons.</p>
<p>Ah, the 1980s. What an era for film.</p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s humor and comedic timing help balance the mystical elements of the film. Had this film taken itself more seriously, I doubt it would have been nearly as enjoyable. Just when the story gets really deep into the mystical side, there&#8217;s Murphy with a joke, or a goofy expression to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>When you have a story with a demon in human form trying to feed a supernatural child blood to weaken his powers, you need a few jokes here and there. It helps keep the dark, occult themes (of which there are many) from overpowering the story.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some &#8220;whatever&#8221; moments, such as when Murphy has to carry a glass of water through an obstacle course without spilling a drop. And, why is a social worker The Chosen One who can save The Child?</p>
<p>But who cares? There is also a dragon lady. And let us not forget the classic, “I want the knife” scene.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr0JXSM_0Nk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>I have probably watched this film, in part or in whole, about a hundred times. It was a fixture on TV in my youth. It was almost always on at any given point, especially the weekends. Sure, it is an odd film, but it has a bit charm, thanks to Eddie Murphy in his prime. This was just after <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>, when he could do no wrong.</p>
<p>Some might disagree, and say <em>The Golden Child</em> was Murphy&#8217;s only stumble during his string of hits in the 1980s. Compared to his other films of the eighties, <em>The Golden Child</em> sticks out like a sore thumb, but only due to its plot. In terms of box office, the film was a success (although, I have read, not in the eyes of the studio).</p>
<p>And as someone who grew up in the 1980s, <em>The Golden Child</em> was a success in keeping me entertained. Over and over again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hard Target (1993) will always go down as &#8220;John Woo&#8217;s first American film.&#8221; But, it should also go down as a hell of a crazy movie.

Crazy in an entertaining way no less (at least to me).</p>
<p>In <em>Hard Target</em> you have a movie with mid-prime Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lance Henriksen (who always excels at crazy), the guy who played the Mummy in <a title="Names escape me." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JQB5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00000JQB5&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>The Mummy</em></a>, and Wilfred Brimley as a Cajun moonshiner. Add strange guns, motorcycles, Van Damme&#8217;s martial arts, John Woo&#8217;s over-the-top style, and you have a highly entertaining 97 minutes of celluloid.</p>
<p>Did I mention at one point Van Damme fires a pistol while holding it upside down?</p>
<p>Oh man, does he ever. I don&#8217;t mean twisting his arm around either, I mean holding the gun like he doesn&#8217;t know which end is up. It is brilliant in its absurdity &#8212; and I love it.</p>
<p>In Woo&#8217;s oeuvre, <em>Hard Target</em> comes right after <a title="Watch it. WATCH IT" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N4SHNK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000N4SHNK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>Hard Boiled</em></a> (1992) &#8212; a film every action fan must watch (and subtitled, not dubbed). If you watch <em>Hard Boiled</em> and <em>Hard Target</em> back to back (and why not?) you will notice a few things: John Woo loves guys firing automatic weapons atop motorcycles, and doves. Yes, doves. One even leads Van Damme to a clue.</p>
<p>An aside: Woo&#8217;s <a title="Classic." href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036BDQBU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0036BDQBU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=clattertron-20" target="_blank"><em>The Killer</em></a> (1989) is another must watch.</p>
<p>Back to <em>Hard Target</em>: Jean-Claude Van Damme&#8217;s hair. Oh. My. Goodness. It is a sight to behold. His mullet is the stuff of legends, so much that I immediately thought of it while <a title="Comic!" href="http://clattertron.com/2012/09/10/mullets/" target="_blank">drawing a comic about mullets</a>.</p>
<p>And let us not forget Mr. Oatmeal himself, Wilfred Brimley. In his finest work since <em>Ewoks: The Battle for Endor</em>, Brimley plays Van Damme&#8217;s recluse, moonshiner uncle. With a Cajun accent no less. It is glorious.</p>
<p>The only thing more glorious is when Van Damme punches a snake and [spoiler alert] bites off its rattle. It is a jaw dropping moment, and I could watch the scene on repeat all day.</p>
<p>Has Woo made better movies? Yes, of course (again, see: <em>The Killer</em> and <em>Hard Boiled</em>). Is <em>Hard Target</em> perfect? Absolutely not. But, does that matter? No. <em>Hard Target</em> is fun &#8212; and it is a great time capsule of early 1990s action films.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The worst part of being an addict is the lack of a fix.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an NHL addict. I read NHL blogs, listen to NHL podcasts, follow NHL writers and players on Twitter, and even had a brief writing gig for a hockey blog (a weekly column about fantasy hockey). Heck, I even had a weekly talk show about the NHL during my tenure as a college radio host. Hockey has been a subject of <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/06/11/being-an-nhl-fan-in-lansing/" target="_blank">a few</a> of my comic strips on <a title="comics and such" href="http://clattertron.com" target="_blank">Clattertron</a>, and will be featured in more to come.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="10595" data-permalink="https://idlermag.com/2012/09/26/here-we-go-again-another-nhl-lockout/igeekhockey/" data-orig-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,464" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Igeekhockey" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=194" data-large-file="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=300" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10595" title="Igeekhockey" src="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=640" alt="I geek hockey" srcset="https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg 300w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=97 97w, https://craiggav.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/igeekhockey.jpeg?w=194 194w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"   /> To further beat a dead horse, when I was asked to be a part of the Capital Area District Libraries&#8217; Geek the Library campaign, my fliers and such proudly proclaimed, “I Geek Hockey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suffice to say, the current NHL Lockout, the third of Commissioner Gary Bettman&#8217;s career, is a blockade around my supply. I&#8217;m an addict without a fix.</p>
<p>And I hate every second. Hate is a strong word, and I try not to over use it, but it applies here. I hate the lockout.</p>
<p>I am still bitter about the loss of the 2004-2005 season due to the previous lockout. Several players I grew up watching missed a chance for one more season. It also meant a year without my favorite few months &#8212; The Stanley Cup Playoffs. No battles against rivals, no stories about a team chasing a cup, no chance of a team finally winning its first Cup or ending a decades long drought. For the first time since 1919, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004–05_NHL_lockout" target="_blank">no Stanley Cup was awarded</a>.</p>
<p>But, like an old girlfriend I can&#8217;t walk away from, I took the NHL back with open arms when it returned. I&#8217;m an addict after all. What was I going to do, start following football?</p>
<p>Not likely. I can&#8217;t stand football, basketball, or baseball. Anything with the &#8220;ball&#8221; suffix is right out &#8212; with the exception of Whirlyball.</p>
<p>First things first: <strong>this is not a strike</strong>. This is a <strong>lockout</strong>.</p>
<p>A strike is when the players refuse to play. That is not the case here. The players were locked out (not able to legally play) by the owners because their collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired, and a new CBA has not been agreed upon.</p>
<p>The previous CBA gave the NHL the salary cap, for better or worse (which is worthy of its own article). And with the salary cap came the insane cap circumventing contracts with a length of ten years or more (the final years of these long contracts have players earning about a million a year, with some contracts lasting until a player was 40 or older &#8212; this brings the yearly cap hit down). Most players are lucky to make it to 40, let alone 42 or 43 when a few notable contracts expire). The New Jersey Devils were penalized when the league deemed their 17-year, $102 million(!) contract with Ilya Kovalchuk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Kovalchuk#New_Jersey_Devils" target="_blank">circumvented the salary cap</a>. He was eventually signed for 15-years and $100 million.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the many, many issues behind this lockout. I recommend checking out the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/marek-vs.-wyshynski/id480511229" target="_blank">Marek versus Wyshynski podcast</a>, because they explain the issues better than I ever could. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/september-17th-edition-marek/id480511229?i=120813352" target="_blank">A recent episode</a> had an interview with NHLPA member (and retired player) Mathieu Schneider.</p>
<p>What this lockout will bring, I cannot say. When it will end is anyone&#8217;s guess. If, IF, this season is saved, I have heard the magic date of late November. This would mean the NHL&#8217;s biggest cash cow, the Winter Classic, would still happen.</p>
<p>As much as I want to see, or attend, an outdoor game featuring the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs (at the University of Michigan&#8217;s Big House no less), I am not optimistic it will happen.</p>
<p>Both sides seem far apart in this lockout, and I have read anecdotal comments from players expecting this lockout to, once again, last all season. NHL players have been heading off to play in Europe this week (most notably, Russia&#8217;s KHL), which hints this lockout could last a while.</p>
<p>I hope not.</p>
<p>Those really hurt by this lockout are the support staff &#8212; the folks who work at the arena. There have been a slew of layoffs around the NHL already, and there are likely more to come.</p>
<p>Please, don&#8217;t let there be another lost season. One game missed it too many. I need my fix. And I don&#8217;t want to resort to fantasy baseball again, like I did last time (I had no idea what I was doing, which the same scenario when I attend a baseball game in person &#8212; I&#8217;m lost, except for the drinking beer outside part. I have that covered).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The range of my taste in film covers a wide area. </p>
<p>If my tastes were represented by a country&#8217;s land area, it would be Russia. Despite my fiancée&#8217;s insistence that I don&#8217;t like any film made after 2000 &#8212; mainly because I had not watched <em>Superbad</em> until last week &#8212; I enjoy many different films. My film collection would suggest as much, which ranges from Oscar winning classics of the 1960s to b-movies of the 1980s, and many more. </p>
<p>One film that holds a place of honor on my shelf is the Bruce Willis vehicle, <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102070/" target="_blank">Hudson Hawk</a></em> (1991). It is absurd, ridiculous, and preposterous. </p>
<p>And I love every damn frame. I love the film so much, I even referenced it in <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/13/microsoft-outlook/" target="_blank">one of my comic strips</a>. </p>
<p>I have a soft-spot for absurd action-comedies, and Hudson Hawk is more or less my gold standard. It is also on the short list of films I have purchased in two or more formats: first VHS, and then DVD (<em>Ghostbusters</em>, <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, and <em>Army of Darkness</em> being the others. <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> will join that list eventually. <em>Gremlins</em>, however, is the reigning champ: VHS, DVD, and Laserdisc—in that order).</p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> is a love it or hate it film. </p>
<p>Folks I know who love the film, love it to pieces and quote it often (the film is incredibly quotable: “You took down Captain Bob&#8217;s steering wheel?!”, “Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!”, “Hey Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.”). </p>
<p>But, for those who can&#8217;t embrace the absurdity, <em>Hudson Hawk</em> is the worst thing put to celluloid this side of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero" target="_blank">Last Action Hero</a></em> (the subject of a future article). </p>
<p>Is <em>Hudson Hawk</em> a perfect film? Hardly.</p>
<p>But, it is entertaining and hilarious (keep in mind this comes from a guy who draws comics rife with <a href="http://clattertron.com/2012/08/06/schmoopy/" target="_blank">absurd humor</a>). It is full of gags I love to death. The scene where the Pope is watching Mr. Ed dubbed into Italian gets me every time. Another favorite (and speaking as someone who is half-Italian) is when an Italian guard pours spaghetti, with sauce, out of a Thermos.</p>
<p>Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello, to me, form an impressive comedic duo. I love their snappy dialogue and banter. They have chemistry, and they come across as real pals. If you go into <em>Hudson Hawk</em> expecting a <em>Die Hard</em>, you will be incredibly disappointed (although the same could probably be said of <em>Die Hard 2</em>). Yet, if you approach <em>Hudson Hawk</em> as a poor man&#8217;s <em>Ghostbusters</em> or <em>Big Trouble in Little China</em>, it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>Maybe. I don&#8217;t make any promises.</p>
<p>If you can find the DVD, give the director commentary by Michael Lehmann a listen. It is as entertaining as it is informative, and I love Lehmann&#8217;s refrain of “Did I mention this film did well in Europe?” after some of the gags. He also explains several scenes which were cut from the film, including a sub-plot about Willis getting revenge for the death of his monkey sidekick, Little Eddie (YES). </p>
<p><em>Hudson Hawk</em> isn&#8217;t perfect, and it isn&#8217;t for everyone, but for those, like myself, who enjoy absurdity, it is 100 minutes well spent. </p>
<p>And it is way funnier than <em>Die Hard 2</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m about to get into <strong>spoiler</strong> territory here, so You Have Been Warned. Ready? I mean it. I want to focus on one of <em>Cave Story</em>’s charms: the characters.</p>
<p><em>Cave Story</em> is rife with quirky, odd-ball characters. Some are talking rabbits. Others are crazy robots. And still others are people in <a href="http://cavestory.wikia.com/wiki/Cthulu" target="_blank">Cthulu</a> costumes. Each one is quirky and interesting. In this way, <em>Cave Story</em> really reminds me of the Nintendo games of my youth. I think the video game medium makes it easier to accept strange characters. I don’t really know why. Maybe it is the cartoonish nature, or that as a player, you are forced to interact with the cast. In <em>Cave Story</em>’s case, you best get accustomed to chatting with robots and rabbits ASAP.</p>
<p>But then, maybe it is just me. Being one who enjoys quirky humor, oddball characters, and writes fantasy stories, talking animals don’t bother me. Nor do floating islands or disgruntled robots. I still think &#8220;being in&#8221; the game makes one more accepting of the strangeness, be it <em>Cave Story</em> or <a href="http://gingerandthegeek.com/category/blog/geek-speak/games/final-fantasy-vii-revisited/"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>. A casual observer might be more likely to question the world of the game.</p>
<p>Case in point, my girlfriend. Now, she is no stranger to fantasy or science fiction, and I don’t bring this up as a sexist, archaic &#8220;Girls Don’t Understand Video Games&#8221; argument (I know plenty of ladies who are hardcore gamers). No, I bring it up, because her casual observations helped me appreciate the strangeness of the game even more.</p>
<p>“Who’s that?” she asked when Curly Brace joined me. “Is she your girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“Uh, I don’t know,” I said between mashing buttons. “She’s just some robot.”</p>
<p>“A robot?”</p>
<p>“I’m a robot too.” A jump. A shot. “I think.”</p>
<p>I bested a boss, and the cave flooded with water. The screen went dark, and when my character came to, Curly was immobile next to me. Steph said as I walked away, “You’re leaving your girlfriend!”</p>
<p>“She’s not my girlfriend! And besides, I can’t take her with me. There isn’t a Drag the Dead Robot command.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised there <em>isn’t</em>.”</p>
<p>I found out later, there is a way to rescue Curly &#8212; using the Tow Rope. So, I suppose there <em>is</em> a Drag the Dead Robot command. Oops.</p>
<p>I bet the strangeness of <em>Cave Story</em> will turn some folks off, but it kept me interested. I wanted to see <em>how</em> strange it would get in the end, and it did not disappoint. Like any good platformer, <em>Cave Story</em> ups the ante for the final boss battles.</p>
<p>I am curious to see what Gavin and Kevin’s final thoughts are of the game. I loved it, and I think the odd-ball characters and story kept me interested. If the game was void of any kind of quirky story, or characters, I may not have enjoyed it as much.</p>
<p>And further research shows there are additional endings. Back to the cave!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I would say the key to any decent platformer is a variety of fun power ups. Be it turtle shells, rocket launchers, or <a href="http://megaman.wikia.com/wiki/Leaf_Shield" target="_blank">leaf shields</a> &#8212; power ups can make or break a game. And <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wJ">being 100 years old</a>, I have seen quite a few in my time. Much to my delight, the weapon power-ups in <em>Cave Story</em> are half the fun of playing the game. Maybe more.</p>
<p>But first, a quick aside. Gavin pointed out <a href="http://wp.me/pZ58k-2wX">you do not have to fight Balrog</a>, the “Oh Yeah!” shouting baddie, in your first meeting. He asks if you want to fight, and well, I selected &#8220;No,&#8221; just to see what would happen. Balrog said, more or less, “OK, see you later,” and left. Interesting.</p>
<p>Back to the power-ups &#8212; <em>Cave Story</em> has you collect items which increase the power, or Level, of your weapons. With each Level, the weapon takes on new abilities. It is a double-edged sword, however. Each time you take damage, so does your weapon, and after several hits, your weapon Level drops, making you weaker. This was an unique mechanic, which added a bit of extra drama to boss battles.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun powering up the weapons to their maximum Levels, just to see the difference it made. Missiles became larger, rates of fire were increased, and so forth. My favorite discovery of the game was when I realized I could propel myself skyward using the powered-up Machine Gun. Just press Down and Fire &#8212; no more pit deaths or trying to make difficult jumps. Granted, one must exercise caution &#8212; the Machine Gun’s ammo needs to recharge after a lengthy burst.</p>
<p>The variety of weapons keeps the game fresh too, as each weapon has its own advantage or disadvantage. For example, the Fireball just bounces along the ground (not unlike in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, just larger). This makes the weapon pretty much useless for ground-to-air attacks, but the Fireball can plow through herds of enemies on hills or slopes. The Bubble weapon was also fascinating, as it doubled as a shield (handy for running through a cloud of baddies).</p>
<p>It seems I get a new weapon every few levels or so, and I look forward to seeing what the rest of the game offers. I just hope I don’t end up having to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boy_and_His_Blob:_Trouble_on_Blobolonia" target="_blank">use jelly beans</a> against baddies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do not even want to know how many hours of my life I have spent playing platformer/side-scrolling video games. Heck, months would be a better unit of measurement. I grew up in the Golden Age of side-scrolling games and built up my thumb muscles thanks to the likes of the Mario Brothers, Mega Man, Master Higgins, and Simon Belmont, to name only a few. I am also well acquainted with Kirby, Samus Aran, Sonic the Hedgehog, Earthworm Jim, and the guy from Shatterhand.</p>
<p>So, when Andrew suggested the throwback title <em>Cave Story</em> for our next Gamers’ Club adventure, I was eager to give the ol’ thumbs a much-needed workout. I downloaded the WiiWare version for 1200 points (roughly $12), and I was hooked the moment I saw the title screen, in all of its pseudo 8-bit glory. </p>
<p>In an era of overly complex and &#8220;realistic&#8221; games, it is nice to go back to something simple: Run. Jump. Shoot. Repeat. No lengthy tutorial stages, no overlong exposition-filled cut scenes, and no listening to characters tell you how to play the game. The gameplay reminds me of <em>Metal Slug</em>, and in two very important aspects: you can shoot up, and you can shoot down. </p>
<p>Not being able to shoot up (or down) was always a criticism of most side-scrollers of my youth, mainly the original <em>Mega Man</em> games. I was also happy to see <em>Cave Story</em> didn’t feature one of the most annoying platform devices ever (at least so far): death or injury by falling from great heights. </p>
<p>Don’t even get me started. Yes, I realize injury or death by dropping from several levels up adds a bit of realism, but it is super annoying, and a cheap kill. I was disappointed to see this device was still in use for modern games when I played <em>Epic Mickey</em>. Pit deaths, and the like, sure. I accept those. If I timed a jump wrong, and fell into a hole, I deserve to be punished. But loss of health, or life, just for dropping a few screens (or less)? C’mon. </p>
<p>I am only about a couple hours into the game (far less if you factor in all my pit deaths), but I love the world and the characters. The Kool-Aid Man referencing Balrog gets me every time he shows up with a jovial, “Oh yeah!” I really enjoy the cartoonish and quirky WTF factor of the game. I don’t see enough of that these days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Volumes have been written about Jean Dujardin and his performance in <em>The Artist</em> (2011), and for good reason &#8212; the guy is hilarious. <em>The Artist</em> was not Dujardin’s first comedy, nor was it his first film with director Michel Hazanavicius or co-star Bérénice Bejo.</p>
<p>The three worked together on the spy-film satire, <a href="http://instantwatcher.com/titles/176926" target="_blank">OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies</a> (2006). It is a hilarious romp, and worth checking out. Do not let the French subtitles scare you away either. I wish more folks would get over their dislike of subtitles, as they are missing out on many great films. </p>
<p>A quick subtitle-related anecdote: I used to work for a big video store, and when <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> came out, all of the store’s VHS copies were subtitled. The store was flooded with people wanting to exchange the tapes, because they &#8220;didn’t want to read.&#8221; It got to the point where I had to preface each transaction with &#8220;This film is subtitled.&#8221; More often than not, folks would change their mind and get a different film (as a result, copies of <em>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</em> were in high demand). </p>
<p>Back to <em>Cairo, Nest of Spies</em> &#8212; like <em>The Artist</em>, it is a period piece. The film takes place in 1950s Cairo, and it is, in a word, gorgeous. The sets, the costumes, the locations, and the cinematography are top notch. The film not only echoes the costumes and locations of 1960s spy films, but also the cinematography and production. Film buffs take note.</p>

Coty? No?</p></div> If you loved Dujardin’s suave, mugging-for-the-camera charm in <em>The Artist</em>, there is plenty more here. Dujardin plays the French version of James Bond, or perhaps more accurately, Maxwell Smart. The humor comes from Dujardin’s character (Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, aka OSS 117) being clueless about everything around him. Most of the humor relies on &#8220;did he just say that?&#8221; gags, as Dujardin makes brash observations about the culture in Cairo. </p>
<p>The humor differs from the over-the-top style of <em>Naked Gun</em> or <em>Austin Powers</em>, but there are thematic similarities. OSS 117 is a fool, but he loves his country (he tries to tip people with photos of President René Coty), and he is the definition of confidence. Dujardin also tries to &#8220;out-Connery&#8221; Sean Connery when it comes to charming the ladies as a spy, which generates plenty of hilarity. The film also features many running jokes (like the Coty photos) and sight gags.</p>
<p>Sure, Dujardin’s OSS 117 is a brash, arrogant fool, but you cannot help but be charmed and amused. Dujardin oozes charm and confidence, and makes OSS 117 quite the lovable character (and there aren’t any jokes about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Powers:_Goldmember" target="_blank">farting submarines</a>). </p>
