										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Farscape</em> was why my spouse and I bought a TiVo. It was a show we discovered not long after we got married and that we were soon watching faithfully. But we discovered after our babe was born in 2001 that live television watching wasn&#8217;t compatible with baby minding, and we rediscovered the unreliabilty of taping shows on a VCR. We couldn&#8217;t do without Moya and her crew, and so we bought a first-generation TiVo, along with a lifetime subscription to its services. We&#8217;ve been proselytizing the joys of TiVo ever since (we&#8217;ve upgraded to a recent model and have hacked that to increase its memory). But <em>Farscape</em> had disappeared from our lives for a while. It went off the air, and although I&#8217;m pretty sure we own it on DVD, I don&#8217;t tend to remember to watch my DVDs. But with its appearance on Netflix Instant, nothing can come between me and Ka D&#8217;Argo again.</p>
<p>What blew me away when we first started watching the series was how far removed it was from the imaginative and visual universe of <em>Star Trek</em>. There&#8217;s no crew of brethren searching for scientific knowledge, no utterly foreign aliens, no discrete episodes with uplifting morals. It&#8217;s a sprawling soap opera in which the crew of the living spaceship constantly argue and jostle for dominance and reveal secrets and longings and shifting alliances. The villains &#8212; and, oh the evil chasing Creighton and Aeryn and the others is evil indeed &#8212; are also complex and sometimes allies in the moment, even while never to be trusted.</p>
<p>The best way in, if you haven&#8217;t seen the show before, is to start at the beginning. But be forewarned: the series was cancelled abruptly, so what should have been a cliffhanger was, for many years, the ending. You&#8217;ll be able to watch beyond the fourth series to the 2004 <em>The Peacekeeper Wars</em> mini-series that tried to wrap things up more equitably. But that sudden ending was the biggest betrayal I&#8217;ve come across in television. I&#8217;m still bitter about it. I&#8217;m actually a bit reluctant to return to the show with the full force of love I felt for it before. I&#8217;ll dip my toes in once and a while, but I can&#8217;t immerse myself anymore. You should, though. Your heart won&#8217;t get broken, I promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a confession.</p>
<p>Sometimes I don’t know what to watch on Netflix. Sometimes I’ve just had enough of watching <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a></em> and <em><a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/02/23/downstairs-at-downton-abbey/">Upstairs, Downstairs</a></em> and even <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/">Paul Newman</a>. Sometimes I just want to see something I haven’t seen before.</p>
<p>So what do I do? I turn to Netflix to see what it can suggest for me. It magically delivers movies right to my television. Surely it can peer into my brain and have its algorithms magically intuit what I want to discover.</p>
<p>Here’s what Netflix is telling me:</p>
<p>Since I recently watched <em>Doctor Who</em>, I will want to watch <em>My Little Pony</em>. No, no I won’t. But when I tweeted my surprise at that recommendation (which then got retweeted a few times) I learned that maybe yes, yes I do. According to one tweeter, <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/">there’s a high correlation between <em>Who</em> fans and bronies</a>. In fact, that tweeter hunted down a number of other folks tweeting about My Little Pony to explain to them that <em>Doctor Who</em> fans and <em>Star Trek</em> fans and <em>My Little Pony</em> fans are all one and the same. I’m not sure any of us were convinced.</p>
<p>Because I’ve watched Buster Keaton’s <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> (a compilation of Keaton shorts, all of which are thoroughly enjoyable, especially if you’re watching them with a 7-year-old and a 10-year-old) and <em>Gosford Park</em> (which is way way way better than <em>Downton Abbey</em> in that it is smarter, funnier, subtler, and heartbreakinger), Netflix has paired them to create a category called “Crime Movies.” So based on my interest in <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> and <em>Gosford Park</em>, I will be interested in the top-rated <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> (too too true, though it’s a crime movie only in the way that the other two are also not crime movies), the most popular <em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em> (definitely a crime movie, but while I do love Harry Bosch, I’m not a big Mickey Haller fan), as well as the <em>Dragon Tattoo</em> trilogy (yes! horrible violence and is-it-or-isn’t-it misogyny!), <em>Chinatown</em> (fill in your own joke here), <em>Kick-Ass</em> (I actually don’t know this one, and the description of it is not convincing me I want to), and <em>Return of the Pink Panther</em> (because that’s a crime movie, yessirreebob). Okay then, maybe not.</p>
<p>Further down the screen, Netflix recognizes that I have an interest in “witty crime movies” (true enough) based on the fact that I’ve watched &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; <em>Sherlock Jr.</em> and <em>Gosford Park</em>. This time, it suggests <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em>, <em>The Way of the Gun</em>, <em>How to Steal a Million</em>, <em>Witness for the Prosecution</em>, <em>Evil under the Sun</em>, and <em>A Night in Casablanca</em>. Apparently witty crime movies are things made long ago, unless they involve Ryan Phillippe and Benicio del Toro, because sexy modern movie stars definitely equally witty intellect.</p>
<p>But if you combine <em>Sherlock Jr</em> with <em>Office Space</em>, Netflix will generate “comedies.” Some of these suggestions are spot-on. I’ve seen them and I’ve loved them. <em>Dr Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog </em>will never get stale, never ever ever. Of course, I own the DVD, with all the extras, but it’s nice to know that I can watch it at work and on my phone and, well, ahem. Back to the subject at hand. <em>The Big Lebowski</em> was plenty enjoyable when I saw it (though, unlike many of the movie’s fans, I only saw it the once). <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>? Is that really a comedy? I do enjoy it, though, as long as I skip over the offensive racist parts. <em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> is, naturally, sheer genius (even if I can’t figure out how to get an umlaut over my n). Based on that track record, I think Netflix is right that I might enjoy <em>The Trip</em>, a mockumentary from Michael Winterbottom with Steve Coogan and Rob Bryden as a couple of actors on a foodie road trip across England. That’s right up my alley. And I have friends who love Louis C.K., so I’m willing to say that his <em>Hilarious</em> probably isn’t a far-fetched recommendation either, even though my gut tells me I won’t like it. But <em>TEDTalks: Smart Laughs</em>? Are you fucking kidding me? And <em>Daniel Tosh: Completely Serious</em>? You’d have to kill me to get me to watch those.</p>
<p>At least I’ll get to watch <em>The Trip</em> first.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I finally decided to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em>. I’m not sure why I hadn’t before. I think it always seemed too hardcore. Everyone I knew who watched the show was constantly making in-jokes with other Who fans. (One indication of how out of it I am: are fans of the show Who fans or Doctor fans?) This is in part because when I was growing up, and indeed up though most of my college years, the show was still on the air. And the folks I knew who watched it? They didn’t just watch the current seasons. No, they went back and watched all the seasons from its start in 1963. (Come to think of it, what did they do before VCRs became readily available? That scarcity might go a long way in explaining the fanaticism of my friends. You have to be hardcore to watch a show in its infancy when it’s not available on streaming, or DVD, or video. You’d have to bond with other people searching out the series instead of sticking with the more readily available <em>Dallas</em> or <em>M*A*S*H*</em>.) (It’s not that I wasn’t a science fiction fan—I have treasured memories of watching <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Star_Trek/70136140" target="_blank">Star Trek</a></em> with my mom, even though that series had stopped, so clearly syndication was available, even back in the dark days of my childhood. But somehow <em>Doctor Who</em> wasn’t part of our picture.)</p>
<p>If I can’t quite explain why I hadn’t watched it before, neither can I explain why I decided to start watching it last year. I suspect that somehow I stumbled across it streaming on Netflix, had nothing else to do, and thought, why not? It might have been after <em>Sherlock</em> was over and I was desperate for something British to watch. I’m not sure. But in any case, the show was baffling and inexplicable and I couldn’t stop watching.</p>

Yes, I laugh knowingly at Dalek jokes, but those are just funny. But a conversation on twitter recently made me realize that I might have my own obsessive corner after all. A tweep announced that he was going to start watching <em>Doctor Who</em> and asked for advice on where to begin—the most recent season? Or back to David Tennant? The consensus, much to my horror, was to begin with David Tennant, aka the Tenth Doctor, who took over the role in the final episode of the return of the series in 2005. I certainly don’t want to cast aspersions on Tennant’s Doctor &#8212; he seems a lovely fellow and all. But the right answer to this question is to start at the beginning of the revived series in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, aka the Best Doctor.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to start the series with the Best Doctor. And I’ll confess that I’m only halfway through the 3<sup>rd</sup> new series (aka the 2007 season), so perhaps Tennant will grow on me, or I’ll discover that Matt Smith, the Eleventh Doctor, is the best of them all. But I doubt it. I think Eccleston has imprinted on me and he’ll be what I always want the Doctor to be. Here’s what I love about him: he’s dangerous, he’s sardonic even when he’s sincere, he’s manic, you don’t quite trust him even when you do, and he needs his companion to keep him from going over to the dark side (whoops, a bit of childhood <em>Star Wars</em> in there) and becoming too destructive. I suppose that seems like it might reveal more about me than about the show, but I’m not really that much into dangerous men. (Ok, given <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/" target="_blank">my previous attestations of love for Paul Newman</a>, that might not be entirely true, though I will stand by my position that his dangerous persona goes hand-in-hand with his real-life loving-husband, do-gooder one.)</p>
<p>What makes Eccleston work in ways that Tennant doesn’t is that he gives the Doctor an edge. Without that edge, it’s too easily just a series of romps through time with someone who is all-powerful and yet has a tragic history. With Eccleston’s manic danger (a trait that he brings to many of his roles, but that here is balanced with some joy and goodness), you get a sense that there’s something at stake in the Doctor’s adventures. Is he going to destroy the world or save it? There’s no fun in the hero always being the hero. It’s the tension between saving and failing that makes a story compelling. Maybe Tennant comes to that later on, but in his first seasons, he doesn’t hold a candle to Eccleston.</p>
<p><em>Doctor Who</em>, currently streaming seasons 1 through 6 of the new series: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441" target="_blank">http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441</a></p>
<p>Some earlier episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> seem to be streaming on Netflix, too, but honestly, the search interface is such a nightmare that I can’t figure out what order the shows go in, so you’re on your own for finding those. Sorry. I recommend you search on <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/" target="_blank">the Instant Watch Database</a> to see what’s what. If <a href="http://www.instantwatchdb.com/search/main?search=1&amp;searchPage=1&amp;previousTextSearch=&amp;previousSubGenre=0&amp;textSearch=Doctor%20Who&amp;textSearchType=all&amp;genre=0&amp;availability=&amp;rating=&amp;quality=&amp;startYear=1914&amp;endYear=2012&amp;Submit=Instant%20Watch%20Search!" target="_blank">this link</a> hasn’t degraded, it will take you to a nice page with the available episodes listed in order. Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, that’s it for <em>Downton Abbey</em>. I’m not exactly sorry to see it go; this second season was so much soapier and sillier than the first season. A badly burned veteran shows up on their doorstep, claiming to be the long-assumed-dead former heir to the estate? Everyone gets in tizzy &#8212; will Matthew be disinherited? Will Edith finally get reward for her long-suffering love for him? Is he who he says he is? And then, well, he leaves at the end of the episode, and that’s that. It’s ridiculous. If you’re going to do the soap opera thing of people returning from the dead, then do it properly, dragging out the storyline, leaving just enough holes open but just enough convincing details to make you not sure what you think. Or at least let him be clearly an imposter but to seduce the audience anyway, since Matthew is such a drag. But to introduce him only to dismiss him immediately? Idiotic.</p>
<p>But what I really hated <em>Downton Abbey</em> for was its condescending dismissal of class politics. Branson, the Irish chauffeur who drove Sybil to her suffrage rallies in the first season and who endlessly spouts class revolution, goes through one belittlement after another. Despite the fact that he hates the English &#8212; with good cause, given his brother’s death in the Easter Rising, an innocent bystander killed by an English solider &#8212; Branson’s big hope to shame the English is to proclaim himself a conscientious objector in front of the entire community when he’s called up to war. Alas, poor Branson has a heart murmur, and so can’t enlist. Instead he has to settle for a back-up plan, one that presents itself when a general comes to dine at Downton Abbey. Short of staff, the head butler accepts Branson’s offer to help serve dinner. Through dastardly music and ominous cutting, we know that Branson is up to something and we, like the always-decent lady’s maid Anna, imagine that it’s assassination. But, no, it’s nothing so actionable. Branson’s plan is to pour a pot of slime on the general because, you know, that will show him not to mistreat the Irish. Nothing like a heap of shit to change the course of history.</p>

<p>As it turns out, of course, Branson isn’t really a revolutionary. He’s just love-sick for Sybil. There are no class differences, only passions of the heart. I suppose it’s something that he does get to marry Sybil and move back to Ireland. The other class transgressors get punished fiercely &#8212; Ethel sleeps with one of the wounded soldiers, gets pregnant, is cast out, and is finally humiliated by the soldier’s horribly snobby parents. And Thomas, poor Thomas wants nothing but to make something of himself, and by the end of the second season, he&#8217;s reduced to begging for his place back as a footman in the house. We aren’t really meant to feel sorry for Ethel, I don’t think. She’s so whiny, she offers nothing of interest to the audience, and we can see her fate a mile off. I do feel sorry for Thomas, but I have to work pretty hard at it. The one gay character, he starts off the first season as someone whose unhappiness in his lot in life is clearly tied to the repressive regime of heterosexuality to which he must conform. But that character arc gets dropped pretty quickly and he becomes more homogeneously petty and rotten. When he’s brought low in the second season, having been out-conned by another con artist on the black market, he sobs and you again get a glimpse of his desperation. But then he has an idiotic scheme to steal and return Lord Grantham’s dog, so as to earn his trust to become his valet, and we’re back in soap opera land.</p>

But I did, near the end of the second season, find myself so put out that I tried finding a cure for my blues in that classic of the servants/masters series, <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em>. I have, at the moment, only seen the first five episodes of the first season (broadcast originally in 1971 in the UK and in 1974 in the US), so all my observations might turn out to be totally wrong. But from the get-go, it seems much less invested in the lives of the upstairs family, and so much more open to the possibility of treating the class dynamics in a much more interesting fashion. The first few episodes focus nearly exclusively on two maids, Rose and the young woman we know as Sarah. We don’t actually know what her name is, though the credits always refer to her as Sarah and it’s what everyone calls her. When she first shows up, she insists that she’s French and has some French name that Lady Marjorie decides is ridiculous for a maid, and so she’s renamed Sarah. The most astounding episode I’ve seen is the third one, “Board Wages,” set in August 1904. The upstairs family and the upper servants are all off on holiday, and the junior servants &#8212; including Sarah and Rose &#8212; have a party at home, dressing up in Lady Marjorie’s gowns and drinking gin in the parlor. But then the son of the family comes home unexpectedly, and hearing them pretending to be ringing for a servant to bring them more drinks, he takes on the role of their servant. It’s dreadfully clear, however, who holds the power in the relationship, and as James brings them champagne and insists that they address him as they would a servant, he also keeps them locked into the parlor and forces them to drink even when they are asking to stop. It only gets worse from there &#8212; the servants escape when he forgets to lock the door, but then he stalks Sarah in her underclothes as she’s trying to return Lady Marjorie’s dress to her closet. The constant threat of violence isn’t casual and even at moments when he and Sarah seem to be approaching a conversation between equals, it’s still there. Sarah ends up leaving the house at the end of that episode, and Rose’s heartbreak at losing her friend is more moving than any of the soap opera tears I saw on <em>Downton Abbey</em>.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen <em>Downton Abbey</em>, <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Masterpiece_Classic_Downton_Abbey/70213223" target="_blank">the first season</a> is on Netflix Instant, and you can just save yourself the heartbreak and stop when that’s over. If you’ve already seen all of the show and need to get your skepticism on, read Gavin’s piece on <a href="http://gavinjcraig.com/2012/01/29/dear-downton-abbey/" target="_blank">breaking up with <em>Downton Abbey</em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Masterpiece_Classic_Upstairs_Downstairs/70175657" target="_blank">The first season of the original <em>Upstairs, Downstairs</em></a> is also on Netflix Instant, and I absolutely recommend watching that &#8212; especially while I wait for <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/upstairsdownstairs/index.html" target="_blank">the 2010 remake/sequel</a> to hit Netflix streaming. I’m sure it will be gorgeous and glittery, but I’m less sure about the rest of its value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love newspapers. When I was a kid we got two on weekdays &#8212; the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> and the <em>Lansing State Journal</em> &#8212; and every morning I started off with the comics (the <em>Free Press</em> was way better in this regard, and many others, than the <em>Journal</em>). On Sundays, once they finally began delivering to poor, benighted East Lansing, we got the <em>New York Times</em>. It was such a big, glorious paper! And, especially because my parents were displaced New Yorkers, it was a tantalizing glimpse of New York culture they’d left behind. It’s no surprise, then, that when I moved to Philadelphia for college, I nearly immediately subscribed to the <em>New York Times</em>. There was a college discount that made it affordable, and I was living the sort of student life where I could devour the whole lot of it every day. And it wasn’t that weird, skimpy national edition. We got the full glories of the New York edition. I’m still the sort of person who gets two newspapers &#8212; two print newspapers, that is. The <em>Washington Post</em> is my local weekday paper, the <em>Times</em> is still my Sunday joy. I probably encounter the papers equally online as opposed to in print, but I love the experience of reading the print paper. I love getting it online, too; it’s two different ways of reading that answer different needs.</p>
<p>Having said all that, <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Page_One_Inside_the_New_York_Times/70169900" target="_blank">Page One: Inside the New York Times</a></em> (2011) should be the movie for me. It’s a documentary about the <em>Times</em>, filmed in 2009 and 2010, when the paper and the news industry as a whole was in the midst of struggling with economic upheavals of the growth of the internet both as a competing source of news and as an advertising engine that was taking away revenue. Director Andrew Rossi focuses on the Media Desk, following editor Bruce Headlam into meetings where he pitches stories for Page One and reporters as they track down stories about WikiLeaks and the demise of the <em>Tribune</em>. But I didn’t love the movie. It took too long to find its focus, and the initial conversations about the relationships between print news and new media felt under thought and too lopsided. But the movie picks up steam when it starts spending more time with reporter David Carr, who is fascinating both for the glimpses we get of his life story (former crack addict, single dad on welfare) and for his irascible love for the <em>Times</em> and righteous indignation about the value of newspapers. Brian Stelter is the counterweight to Carr: new media transfer to legacy news, Stelter was still an undergrad at Towson University when he caught the eyes of the industry with his blog TVNewser and he’s now still a young ’un, albeit one who works for the biggest newspaper in town. The intellectual arguments about the future of the newspaper industry are fascinating, but this is a movie best approached as about how these individual reporters are navigating it.</p>
<p>If you can’t get enough of the <em>New York Times</em>, you might also want to watch <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bill_Cunningham_New_York/70141814" target="_blank">Bill Cunningham New York</a></em> (2010), a documentary about the 80-year-old bike-riding fashion photographer who loves street fashion as much as (or even more than) high fashion. Cunningham is just wonderful, and while the film is primarily about him, you get glimpses inside the <em>Times</em> newsroom as he and his editor work through the layout of his pieces. If you’re not interested in clothes, you’ll still like the movie: it’s full of information about publishing and life at Carnegie Hall and keeping the world at arm’s length.</p>
<p>And if you need some fictional newspaper stories to get your proper fix, <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Absence_of_Malice/214064" target="_blank">Absence of Malice</a></em> (1981)  is finally back on Netflix Instant. You all already know <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/17/paul-newman-is-hot/">how I feel about Paul Newman</a> and he’s in fine form here. But you also get a searching look at the ethics of reporting as well as lots of newspaper technology porn, with lots of shots of presses in action and typing on computers and hidden microphones. If you want to get a feel for the changing technologies of reporting, this is the perfect companion to <em>Page One</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am one of the many who, when Netflix split the fees for streaming from those for DVD rentals, decided to go streaming-only. When I’d had both, the sixth disk for the first season of <em>Glee</em> languished by my tv set for months. It would probably still be there if they hadn’t threatened to make me buy it. So it was pretty clear to me that I wasn’t watching enough DVDs to make paying even a minimal amount worth my while. I said farewell to the couple of items in my queue &#8212; <em>Gandhi</em>, I think, and <em>Neptune’s Daughter</em> &#8212; and haven’t looked back.</p>
<p>Ok, I look back sometimes. Mostly I like the challenge of streaming only. Sure there are things I’d like to watch that aren’t available streaming, but that just gives me the chance to stretch my taste. Can’t stream <em>Young Frankenstein</em>? Maybe <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Producers/60011311?trkid=2361638" target="_blank">The Producers</a></em> (1968) will do &#8212; and it will! It’s a great movie! (The original, natch, not that new-fangled one with Ferris Bueller. And by the way, Netflix’s replacement suggestion for <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> is <em>Weird Science</em>, not the same thing at all, so don’t be fooled by that.) Did you want to watch <em>Sammy and Rosie Get Laid</em>? Stream <em><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/My_Beautiful_Laundrette/60010689?trkid=4785815" target="_blank">My Beautiful Laundrette</a></em> (1985) instead, both great Hanif Kureishi/Stephen Frears films.</p>
<p>But sometimes substitutes won’t do. Here are a few reasons why you might want to splurge on a month or two of DVD rentals for the one you love:</p>
<p><em><strong>M*A*S*H</strong></em> &#8212; It’s <em>M*A*S*H</em>. All 11 seasons. That’s got to be a ton of DVDs, all worth it. Okay, maybe not all. The early seasons are vastly different than the late seasons. Hawkeye and Houlihan are totally different people &#8212; and thank goodness for that. They would have been unbearable if they’d been the same all those years. Hearing about Harry Morgan’s recent death brought back how much I loved this show growing up. We didn’t really watch television in my house, with <em>Sesame Street</em> and <em>M*A*S*H</em> being the notable exceptions. (Also, weirdly, anything that was on Friday nights, which accounts for my familiarity with the <em>Dukes of Hazzard</em>.) My sister and I watched the show so faithfully we could identify which episode it was within seconds of it starting. And then we’d watch it all the way through anyway. I still have a huge crush on Alan Alda.</p>
<p><em><strong>Revengers Tragedy</strong></em> (2002) &#8212; An adaptation of the wonderfully bloody and obscene Jacobean revenge play directed by Alex Cox and starring Christopher Eccles and Derek Jacobi, this is one of the best film adaptations of Renaissance drama out there, and I’m including Shakespeare’s films in the mix. It’s not easy to watch, but it shouldn’t be easy to watch. There’s murder and rape and grostesqueries and entirely too much glee and sadism for it to be enjoyable. Cox makes it into an indictment of our own times, with a decaying capitalism and apocalyptic landscape and everyone so numbed to life that sports and drugs and sex are all that are left. It feels like the end of the world and you should watch it. There’s no equivalent to it streaming, and there’s little equivalent to it on DVD.</p>
<p><em><strong>Top Hat</strong></em> (1935) &#8212; There are other Fred Astaire movies streaming on Netflix, but there are none of his best ones: no Ginger Rogers, no Rita Hayworth, no Cyd Charisse. Most importantly, there’s no <em>Top Hat</em> and I’ve been dying to show this one to my kids, in part because “Cheek to Cheek” is one of the bedtime songs I sing and in part because it’s just wonderful. It’s got glamour, wonderful music, a dress with ostrich feathers, the hilarious Edward Everett Horton, and the most amazing dancing this side of heaven.</p>
<p><em><strong>Charlotte’s Web</strong></em> (2006) and <em><strong>Babe</strong></em> (1995) &#8212; If you want to watch a great movie with your children about an adorable pig, there are, amazingly, two to choose from, and neither of them are streaming on Netflix! How can that be? We are big fans of the live-action <em>Charlotte’s Web</em> and so actually own the DVD (and incredibly have not destroyed it through endless rewatching) but my kids have yet to experience <em>Babe</em> and I’m beginning to feel like they must. Why watch one adorable pig when you could watch two?</p>
<p>Finally, I was going to end with something highbrow: <em><strong>Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt</strong></em> (1927). I saw this film in college as part of my brief fascination with early German cinema. I haven’t seen it since, but it made a huge impression on me. It’s a montage chronicling a day in late-1920s Berlin and it’s a masterpiece. It’s not going to be in everyone’s taste. But if you fancy yourself a cinephile, or you want to impress someone who is, rent this. At the very least, it’s gorgeous. And as it turns out, you can <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/BerlinSymphonyofaGreatCity" target="_blank">watch it streaming</a>! Not on Netflix, but on the Internet Archive, where the Silent Film collection is full of goodies, including this one. Watch and enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So as I pointed out <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/10/12/shakespeare/">last month</a>, there are some great (and some not-so-great) films of Shakespeare’s plays. But sometimes you don’t feel like watching Shakespeare. Sometimes, you want to watch something a bit different. So, for those nights, here are some adaptations that offer Shakespeare with a twist, with a little bit of something for everyone.</p>
<p>Do you want your Shakespeare adaptation &#8212;</p>
<ul>
<li>to be high-brow? Try <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_King_is_Alive/60020495" target="_blank">The King Is Alive</a>, a 2001 film from the Dogme 95 group in which a group of tourists stranded in the Namibian desert decide to stage <em>King Lear</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be low-brow? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Strange_Brew/60024403" target="_blank">Strange Brew</a> is for you. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas as the cult Canadian duo Bob and Doug McKenzie star in this bizarre and fabulous 1983 adaptation that marries a love of beer and all things Canadian with <em>Hamlet</em> and results in a whole lot of deadpan hilarity.</li>
<p></p>
<li>full of snark? Then you need to join the <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> crew to watch Maximilian Schell’s 1961 performance as <em>Hamlet</em> in <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000_Hamlet/60032692" target="_blank">MST3K: Hamlet</a>. As a bonus, this can double as high-brow if you mute it and substitute your own dialogue in suitably Germanic-accented English.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to babysit your children? Two different <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> adaptations are for you: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Romeo_Juliet_Sealed_with_a_Kiss/70057577" target="_blank">Romeo and Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss</a> (2006) and <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Gnomeo_and_Juliet/70140917" target="_blank">Gnomeo and Juliet</a> (2011). Why a play about teenage suicide is suitable for the under-8 crowd is beyond me, but apparently it is.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be about existential angst? You can’t beat <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead/60034967" target="_blank">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</a>, Tom Stoppard’s 1990 adaptation of his stage adaptation of <em>Hamlet</em>. On the other hand, if you think the undead are angsty enough, then perhaps <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Undead/70115436" target="_blank">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead</a> (2009) is more your cup of tea.</li>
<p></p>
<li>in the form of a western? Then mosey over to <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Broken_Lance/60010181" target="_blank">Broken Lance</a>, a 1954 adaptation of <em>King Lear</em> starring Spencer Tracy. Or maybe film noir is more your thing? Then try <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Machete/70147212" target="_blank">Machete</a>, a 1959 <em>Othello</em> set in Puerto Rico.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to include Charles Mingus and Dave Brubek? You can have that! <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/All_Night_Long/70142068" target="_blank">All Night Long</a> (1962) sets <em>Othello</em> in the jazz world. Not enough music? Try Placido Domingo in Verdi’s <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Otello/60026938" target="_blank">Otello</a>, directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1986.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to feature prisoners? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Shakespeare_Behind_Bars/70043431" target="_blank">Shakespeare behind Bars</a> is a 2005 documentary about prisoners in Kentucky’s Luther Luckett Correctional Complex putting on a performance of <em>Tempest</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to focus on mid- to late-1990s adaptations of <em>Hamlet</em>? You’ve got two to choose from! <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Royal_Deceit/60028447" target="_blank">Royal Deceit</a> (1994) and <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Let_the_Devil_Wear_Black/60031768" target="_blank">Let the Devil Wear Black</a> (1999).</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be violent and bloody? <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> is your friend. Try <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Tromeo_Juliet/1066571" target="_blank">Tromeo and Juliet</a> (1995), <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Romeo_Must_Die/60000396" target="_blank">Romeo Must Die</a> (2000), or <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Rome_Jewel/70129151" target="_blank">Rome &amp; Jewel</a> (2008). The first one is from Troma, so mixes some camp in with the gore; the second is Jet Li, so brings home the martial arts; the last is a hip-hop musical that I haven’t seen and am not hugely inclined to.</li>
<p></p>
<li>to be violent and bloody and without all the speechy bits but with the master of horror? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Theater_of_Blood/70147559" target="_blank">Theatre of Blood</a> (1973) stars Vincent Price as an actor who revenges himself on unappreciative critics by murdering them Shakespeare-style. And what could be better Shakespeare than that?!</li>
<p>
</ul>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Werner</strong> has two sons, at least one job, and too many books to<br />
read. As a result, Netflix Instant is her constant companion. She <a href="http://sarahwerner.net">blogs about books and reading</a> and is<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A confession up front: this post comes close to violating <em>The Idler</em>’s mandate to focus on things we enjoy. In another part of my life, I am a Shakespeare scholar. I write about his plays in performance, I edit volumes about the topic, I used to teach the subject regularly. In other words, Shakespeare is part of my working life, not part of my idle pleasure. Not only that, there’s a lot of Shakespeare that I find tedious. Given my research, I ought to find Shakespeare on film and video interesting, perhaps even enjoyable. But you know what? A lot of it is no fun at all. It’s just boring. It plods along, probably prettily, and much too respectfully.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I gather that there are people who like to watch Shakespeare films, who might even make a point of seeking them out. I’m not sure why they do that. Is it a love of the plays? A sense of highbrow improvement? General curiosity about how a 400-year-old play turns into a movie? Back when Kenneth Branagh was successful, that must have been at the root of it. But I’m here to introduce those people into a different world of Shakespeare. Yes, there’s a bunch of the standard stuff on Netflix. But there’s some great stuff there too, stuff that isn’t boring, isn’t what you expect, that uses Shakespeare to make a movie instead of using a movie to make Shakespeare.</p>

<p>I like Branagh’s <em>Henry V</em> okay; I like it better when I think about it in terms of the genre of Vietnam movies and what it might tell us about late 1980s attitudes towards leadership and war. That nice meta-moment when the film switches from the sound stage opening to the film itself? That’s nice. And it’s lifted straight from Laurence Olivier’s opening to his <em>Henry V</em>, with its shift from horribly inadequate Renaissance stage to open fields and movie technology. Both, of course, get this from the opening Chorus in Shakespeare’s play, who doubts the ability of the stage to represent the history at hand and so asks the audience to “Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.” In any case, both movies will give you a good sense of the traditional history of Shakespeare on film. And watching them together, if you haven’t done it before, will do much to dispel the myth that filmed Shakespeare needs to somehow be “faithful” to the play. These two versions play off of each other in their differences and you can’t ask for a better demonstration of how every performance of Shakespeare is shaped by the cultural moment that creates it.</p>

(Never assume that a Shakespeare professor will be more rigid in her adherence to the play than the general public; we are much less bardolatrous than you think.) Try Derek Jarman’s 1979 <em>Tempest</em> for a taste of this. The film isn’t unexpected for what it does to the plot, but how it goes about moving through it. With the punk singer Toyah Willcox as Miranda, radical playwright and poet Heathcote Williams as Prospero, blind dancer Jack Birkett as Caliban, and the island setting replaced with a decaying mansion, Jarman’s movie embodies a disjointed aesthetic that makes the play into something that explores power and the dispossessed in terms both of bondage and creation. I’d never had a chance to see it before I found it on Netflix, and though I meant just to watch the opening scenes to get a taste of it, I watched the whole thing through, never quite sure what was going to happen next. (If you’re still doing the DVD thing, consider watching Jarman’s film of Marlowe’s <em>Edward II</em>. It’s amazing, both for how it uses the play as a jumping off point for an argument for queer politics and for its bare yet glamorous aesthetic.)</p>
<p>Peter Brook’s 1971 <em>King Lear</em> is a different sort of film. It’s professional in a way that Jarman was not interested in, with some truly great actors in the lead roles: primarily Paul Scofield as Lear, but also Irene Worth as Goneril and Cyril Cusack as Albany. Brook himself is one of the most important theatre directors of our age, and an even more outsize influence in Shakespeare productions. So its pedigree puts it in company of all those other pretty and respectful films I find dull. But this is separated from others in its genre by its relentless cruelty. <em>King Lear</em> is a hard play, so much so that it can be difficult to stomach. Everyone’s treatment of everyone else is painful to watch, and their deaths are worse and worse. It’s tempting for productions to play on our sympathy—poor old Lear, such cruel thankless children. And poor pitiful Cordelia, so innocent and poorly used. But this film doesn’t wallow in that sadness, nor shy away from the cruelty of the story. It is as brutal as anything I’ve seen. Right before Lear storms with his 100 men out of Goneril’s home, he turns back to stare at her and she blanches in fear. She’s right to do so: he leads his men in a riot destroying her hall and spits a deeply cruel insult into her face. He doesn’t sustain his range. He knows he will be mad, and the madness comes. There’s no histrionics, no music to compound or assuage our pain. It’s just relentlessly pitiless. The movie is worth watching for Scofield’s performance alone; in combination with Brook’s power, you won’t know what hit you. Alas, it’s only on Netfilx streaming until October 15th, so catch it quick.</p>
<p>There are other notable Shakespeare films streaming right now, but I won’t discuss them in depth. I’m assuming most of you have already seen the Luhrmann <em>Romeo + Juliet</em> (the one with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes), but it holds up well and is worth seeing again; play it against the Zeffirelli version to see how times have changed. If you haven’t seen Olivier’s <em>Hamlet</em>, treat yourself to it; there’s a reason it was so influential and why we think of Olivier as such as great actor. Some of my favorites aren’t streaming (Orson Welles’s <em>Othello</em> is astonishing, and Alex Cox’s film of Middleton’s <em>Revengers Tragedy</em> is anarchic and wrenching) but the ones that are available will go a long way to washing that <em>Anonymous</em> drek out of your mouth. Maybe next time I’ll share some of my favorite adaptations, but if you can’t wait that long, I’ll leave you with this: <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Strange_Brew/60024403" target="_blank">Strange Brew</a> is back!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The leading man of my featured items today has it all: he’s lithe, funny, soldiers on through existential crises, doesn’t overstay his welcome, and, above all, comes with a fabulous soundtrack. That’s right, the Pink Panther is on Netflix Instant and he will win you over in a heartbeat. More importantly, your kids will love him too.</p>

I mean the Pink Panther who loped across screen accompanied by Henry Mancini’s wonderful theme music, the long-legged, silent star. I absolutely do not mean, under any circumstances, any of the 1980s, 1990s, or 2000s remakes of Pink Panther. I don’t know what those things are, but they are not lithe, nor funny, nor fabulous.</p>
<p>The other thing you need to know when I’m recommending the Pink Panther is that I did not grow up watching him on Saturday morning cartoons. I was a Bugs Bunny gal, through and through, and I have no memory of the Pink Panther or the Inspector, other than seeing him in commercials for Owens Corning fiberglass insulation. But, as a harried mom does when home with a sick child and in need of getting some work done, I trolled through Netflix and stumbled across <em>The Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection</em>. Little did I know: my sick one loved it and his laughter was so contagious that I had to watch too, and very little work got done that day. </p>
<p>I’m not sure I find him as hilarious as my kids do. I’m continually baffled by the ways in which the Pink Panther is not Bugs Bunny.  Bugs Bunny never loses, for instance; no matter how crazy the situation, he always comes out on top, and the few times that he doesn’t, you get the impression that he’s fine with that, so it’s like he’s really winning after all. The Pink Panther, unlike Bugs, sometimes outwits his opponent (usually The Man, but not always), but sometimes he’s the doofy outwitted one. Many times the plots are only tangentially adversarial, existing only to serve up the real joy of the short, which is the existential flexibility of the cartoon medium. I’m not talking about the ways in which cartoon characters get anvils dropped on their heads and run over by trucks and the feathers pulled right off them but then go on to reappear seconds later back to their normal healthy selves. I’m talking about the ways in which what seems like a bear skin rug turns into a real bear, and you can walk through walls and climb into holes that appear in the background and reappear in other locations and you can split yourself into pieces. The Pink Panther excels at these feats, and all the hints of metaconscious you’ve seen in earlier Freleng cartoons come full force here.</p>
<p>That’s the beauty of cartoons: anything is possible. I don’t know why our culture moved away from thinking about cartoons as theatrical releases for adults and towards developing them as Saturday morning pablum for kids. Yes, I know that there are adult-oriented cartoons out there (thank you, Matt Groening) but overwhelmingly cartoons have become bland, hyperactive, poorly drawn drek for children. This could lead me down a path ranting about why do we give our most impressionable minds ugly stupid things, but I’ll stop myself. Instead, sit down and watch some Pink Panther with them. They might not watch it in the way that you do, but you will all love it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This will come as no surprise, but I’ll say it anyway: Paul Newman is hot. That description really doesn’t do him justice, though. He was so beautiful when he was young that it’s nearly painful. It’s not just his famously blue eyes &#8212; though, oh my, they make my heart skip a beat &#8212; or the swagger in his walk. It’s those full lips and the hint of disgust with himself in his eyes. </p>

In <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> (1958), he settles into his marriage again after an emotional scene coming to terms with Big Daddy’s mortality. There are a lot of similarities between the two movies: crazy southern families led by despotic fathers, sons vying for his affection, antagonistic wooing between Newman and the female lead. <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> is the better movie, what with Liz Taylor’s amazing Maggie the Cat and her overripe desperate sexuality and lovely violet eyes, and Burl Ives’s powerful performance adds heft to the drama; Tennessee Williams’s play is, of course, genius even without their performances (it’s actually better than the film, which tones down Brick’s queerness and makes nonsense of why he’s so conflicted). <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> is iconic. <em>The Long, Hot Summer</em> is not, but it’s also got a fabulous pedigree (it’s based on William Faulkner’s stories) and the bonus of Joanne Woodward, whose cool strength is a better match for Newman, and the sheer joy of watching them together in their first movie. Orson Welles is hammy, but great; a young Lee Remick does a lot with her small part and Angela Lansberry was always worth watching before she dumbed down her talent for <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>. <em>The Long, Hot Summer</em> also features a shirtless Paul Newman, which is no small joy, and the bubbly chemistry between Newman and Woodward when they kiss at the end makes up for the otherwise almost senseless shift toward melodrama in the last portion of the movie.</p>
<p>Newman is sexy and charming in both of those films. In <em>Hud</em> (1963), he’s sexy but cold and angry. He’s a bastard, through and through, and it breaks your heart. There’s no happiness in the movie except for Patricia Neel’s sassy and strong Alma, but that disappears in the end, too. If you want some despair and to see an incredibly strong performance to convince you that Newman isn’t just a pretty face, watch the movie. Let yourself dislike him, even if you dislike disliking him, and you’ll see the power of his performance. His beauty is part of why he is the way he is, but it doesn’t excuse his cruelty. If in the other movies he’s the sexy outsider redeemed through the love of a father and the right woman, in <em>Hud</em> his father’s death never moves him and even though Neel’s Alma is as right as they come, Newman’s Hud brings her down instead of rising to her level. I watched the movie for the first time last week, and I don’t think I can watch it again. But you should watch it, just once, to understand why Newman is so great and to respect how he turns the very seductive qualities of his earlier films against us in this one.</p>

That’s partly thanks to roles that let him relax a bit, to show some humor and not awe us into submission and desire. <em>Cool Hand Luke</em> (1967), alas, is not on Netflix Instant, though maybe it will be &#8212; the Newman movies seem to come and go, so fingers crossed. To get a sense of how funny and relaxed Newman can be, and to be grateful that he didn’t always get stuck being the pretty face, watch his buddy flicks with Robert Redford: <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> (1969) (for those of you who like your 1960s-inflected Westerns) or <em>The Sting</em> (1973) (for fans of 1970s-inflected Depression-era mob flicks). I’m not normally partial to Redford, but they have a wonderful chemistry together and Newman as the elder statesman is hugely desirable &#8212; who wouldn’t want to be under his wing? Perhaps the most amazing thing about Newman in this middle years is how comfortable he seems. He’s still as desirable as anything, but his good looks aren’t a pressure anymore. Remember how gorgeous Marlon Brando was as a young man? He too had that mix of vulnerability and masculinity &#8212; the butch but feminine face. But as Brando aged, he lost that beauty and it’s hard not to miss how stunning he was when you watch the later movies, as powerful of an actor though he was. Newman does the opposite &#8212; he continues to grow as an actor, but he doesn’t fight against his looks. His beauty catches up to him in his middle age, and as he looks a little bit creased and worn, he seems that much more possible and desirable. </p>
