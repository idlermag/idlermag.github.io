										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt this game is strange and, by all rights, I should love it for its quirkiness alone. I mean, I can’t tell you how many ostensibly terrible anime series I found myself plowing through in order to simple find the goodness. Sadly, I think <em>Earthbound</em> was doomed from the start. The graphics alone betray a cookie cutter element. Mind you, there were limitations to the medium during the time of Super Nintendo, but <em>Earthbound</em> doesn’t seem to play with them. Compare to three screenshots from my favorite SNES games.</p>
<p><em>Chrono Trigger</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Earthbound gives me this for random encounters.</p>

<p>The games menu system is already clunky, I need to press three buttons minimum to even interact with the world and then the combat itself boils down to a series of menus. It might be forgivable if SNES wasn’t the golden age of RPGs or if it was developed for the previous system (remember how horrible <em>Final Fantasy</em> was in retrospect?), but the days of text adventures and progressive MUDs had long past.</p>
<p>Simply put, I expected more.</p>

I just got through the Saturn Valley area Daniel mentioned last week, but in order to do that I had to get through <a href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Belch">Master Blech</a>&#8216;s Factory which required a password for entry, namely not touching the controller for three minutes. It was a short map, like every area map, extended simply by mobs like these little devils.</p>

<p>They are hardy little bastards that call more of themselves and cast a debuff that seems to decrease your offensive power making them harder to hit. So you can either attempt to power through them by spamming the physical attacks or choose to cast a powerful spell, like fire beta, for an large amount of what the game calls PP (power points?).</p>
<p>Your entire success in the game hinges on choosing between these physical attacks and powerful area effective spells, unwise decisions essentially mean you don&#8217;t have heals when you need them. And, sadly, the game isn&#8217;t balanced and with certain randomized groups of mobs, your decisions may be wise in the immediate context, only to hurt you irrevocably in the future. There is just no telling, however, until thirty minutes of unsaved progress.</p>
<p>I can happily put up with a grind like this if it gives me something interesting to feed on, but (to harp on what is certainly an old tune) the quirkiness of the world and generic &#8220;if you believe, you WILL succeed&#8221; plot just isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am two hours into a six hour evening train ride from Saint Louis to Kansas City. The long weekend has consisted largely of couch sleeping and liver-angering evenings. The sun has set, discouraging me to mindlessly gawp at small Midwestern towns, some dude, last stop, picked me to accidentally bump legs with for the next four hours and, just as I was typing this very sentence, somebody a few rows ahead of me farted. I am exhausted, aggravated, but I have an almost feverish desire to write something not shitty because every single keystroke, lately, feels like the singularly greatest illustration of a mediocre mind.</p>
<p>That last paragraph, farting included, is almost a perfect metaphor for the early game feel for Earthbound. I get carried along from town to town with hardly any sense of town’s history or people but a series of obstacles, a cave or a forest AND  monsters, almost scaled <em>too well</em> for my level.</p>
<p>Every fight, boss or otherwise, feels identical, every town has only one distinguishing quirk.</p>
<p>But isn’t this true of nearly every other SNES RPG, is it? <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Final Fantasy II</em> both had repetitive and/or random encounters and town-dungeon-town-dungeon plot spacing. What is it that made them feel different and unrepetitive? Why did the world feel open and connected, not narrow and disjointed?</p>
<p>My intial response was that they show, not tell, but I am not sure that would pass serious scrutiny. JRPGs, almost by nature, are textual games with the trappings of sprites. Even <em>FFVII</em>, with its bells, whistles, and cut-scenes fundamentally drove plot, giving it context and meaning (remember the Inn plot discussion at the first town out of Midgar? The plot explination was so long, it gave you a save point in the middle of it). Then again, all the greatest moments of these games are <em>not</em> the cutscenes and conversations, but the little moments of in-game spirit expression: a frog knight lies wounded on the ground, the excitement of an old man wizard who suddenly remembers the epic spell &#8220;Meteo,&#8221; the confused shrug of a spikey haired hero over a girl&#8217;s reaction.</p>
<p><em>Earthbound</em> seems to have nearly none of this, with the exception of peace sign from the main character when a strange photographer shows up out of the blue. But, whether this will finally connect to the plot remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Speaking of plot, I still don’t understand anything substantial connections about the characters or towns. It all seems to center around one heavy-handed, quirky <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina" target="_blank">deus ex machina</a> after another.</p>

<p>Take Threed, the zombie town Daniel talked about last week. You are simply presented with the solution by sending a new character through a forest and a chinsey dungeon (the developer makes you aware that he is aware of its lameness). How are you rewarded exactly? By having the Orange Kid, an inventor character from the last town, gives you a phone call and conveniently has “Zombie Paper” (you know, fly paper but for zombies) delivered to the town by a pizza delivery guy. There was almost no indication that I was even moving toward a solution, it just happened.</p>
<p>This not only seems to disjoin and obsucure the plot, but also makes obstacles feel like obstacles for the sake of obstacles which makes the proverbial train feel like it moves slower than it should. Still I already paid for the ticket, so I’ll finish the ride.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a deep suspicion that upon completing this game, I will have declared it almost good. The menus are clunky, the level grinding would be tiresome if there wasn’t a auto-fight feature (and, even then, it’s annoying) and whenever I kill a boss I feel relief not satisfaction. I will, however, hold off on serious analysis until I get a full party and, presumably, some plot.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s session was a bit long for how little progress I made. I zipped through Restful Peaceful Valley, avoiding as many mobs as I could, to find myself in Happy Happy Village where I could level and money grind with ease.</p>
<p>The level grind is pretty straightforward. There is a mob called the Insane Cultist which grants you 353 experience points a pop AND calls for reinforcements. So, on a good pull, you can walk away with over 1,000 exp. Rinse, repeat for a an hour or so and you’ll faceroll the town’s leader, Carpainter, so you can free Paula and get your first party member (and more inventory space!).</p>
<p>The money grinding takes a little more time. You see, Fresh Eggs, which sell for $12, after about three minutes, will hatch into chickens which sell for $110. But in Happy Happy Village, before you save Paula, there is a pay what you want vendor which get get take eggs for free. So, the majority of my gaming session ran like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get Eggs</li>
<li>Go make myself a hotpocket</li>
<li>Check my twitter feed</li>
<li>Go get ice for bourbon and come back to check on eggs</li>
<li>Realize the bourbon bottle was still in the kitchen</li>
<li>Return to kitchen to fill glass, grab hotpocket, and sell chickens in game</li>
</ul>
<p>Rinse, repeat, and you effectively have infinite money and a real good buzz.</p>
<p>So, with a new party member and flush with cash, I returned to Twosome to restock on one of the more essential items in the game, <a href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Teddy_Bear" target="_blank">the Teddy Bear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In battle, Teddy Bears will occasionally (75% of the time for normal attacks) take hits from oncoming enemies for Ness and his friends. Some attacks like PSI Magnet will always target them and are ineffective. The Teddy Bear has approximately 100 HP, and after taking enough damage, will be reduced to a mere pile of fluff and removed from the inventory of whichever character was wielding it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, during my internet travels, I found a trick to heal your bear: simply give it to Escargo Express, the item storage delivery/pick-up service, and, the next time you retrieve it, the health is restored.</p>
<p>That’s really all I got this week, I am looking forward to barreling through more of the story so I can begin to understand what makes Daniel love this game so much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the screenshot, I am not entirely sure about this game.</p>
<p>The game mechanics themselves are uninspired. Kill stuff and gain experience to get new abilities and increase incomprehensible stats at a mathematically consistent rate. And, as I mentioned last time, the enemies are brutal, a misplaced heal and you&#8217;re done, which means a lot of reloading and lost progress (early game, anyway, we’ll see how it pans out in the future).</p>
<p>I am not also not sure whether I love or hate the auto-fight option. There is something weird about letting a game play itself and if it’s actually required to make a game playable you can replace the word “weird” with “terrible.”</p>
<p>Here are thoughts that actually ran through my mind during my last session:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Let me check my email real quick”</li>
<li>“I better check twitter while I am at it and find out what this Qwickster nonsense is all about.”</li>
<li>“I wonder if I will miss anything if I mute the sound and watch some bad anime at the same time”</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, these are not good signs. I can only hope the quirkiness starts to really grab me.</p>

<p>I was pretty stoked about this time traveling bee dude that appeared to tell me how I was going to save the world, then helps me beat down a terrifying alien only to get squashed later by a friend’s mom. This made me sad.</p>
<p>I just don’t know folks, I’m willing to keep plugging away, but quirkiness alone might not be able to carry this game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I taken more stabs at this <a href="http://starmen.net/mother2/" target="_blank">Earthbound/Mother 2</a> than I care to admit and each time I ended up the one murdered. Heaven knows it isn’t the weirdness. I&#8217;ve spent the better part of my life in weirdness, much of which happens to be Japanese. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL" target="_blank">FLCL</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tatami_Galaxy" target="_blank">The Tatami Galaxy</a>, both coming-of-age, fourth-wall breaking, culturally referential, magically real anime. These series are best watched rather than explained since they are arguably highest form of the modern Japanese narrative aesthetic and <em>EarthBound</em>, though made earlier, certainly plays in the same sandbox.</p>
<p>Example: In the first hour I encounter a dog who becomes possessed by a game designer in order to give me a mini-tutorial on the game&#8217;s item menu system and, upon completion, the dog returns to its normal barking.</p>

<p>{instert Simone squee here}</p>
<p>So, if the game world is delightful that really only leaves the design. Early game is brutal. You can only save at telephones, black phones are free, green are pay. In the first the area is a black telephone at your parents which is very far from all the action in town or you can pay in town. Now, that’s not so bad, but healing items, like burgers and fries, are expensive and most of the enemies whollop you hard, so money is horded simply to afford better armor and items. This makes using pay phones ineffient unless you are VERY far away. Enemies, however, also respawn every time you leave an area, so you often also need to fight your way back to phone, pay or not.</p>
<p>And THAT, my friends, is a recipe for lost progress.</p>
<p>Now, don’t hear what I am not saying. I am a fellow who loves a challenge, but I play games to enjoy myself not experience nerd rage.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, emulator save states for the win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong> Remember <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2010/12/16/a-day-in-the-life/">my <em>Octodad</em> review</a>? Well, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1432651738/octodad-2?at=1f33aab22cb79d0b&amp;response_id=450058" target="_blank">they are making a sequel</a> thanks to Kickstarter.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1432651738/octodad-2/posts" target="_blank">they’ve re-released <em>Octodad</em> in celebration</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to properly celebrate this occasion we’ve decided to release an updated version of Octodad 1 with <strong>TWO NEW LEVELS!</strong> Right now only the <strong>Windows v1.5</strong> is available due to some issues with Mac’s Lion OS, but Mac owners can expect their own v1.5 in <strong>September</strong>. Now these levels aren’t for the feint of heart and are a bit of a challenge, but they do bring a bit of closure to the first game’s story.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Gavin’s reflections about <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/08/06/let-me-tell-you-a-story/">narratives in video games</a> plays nicely with a Rock, Paper, Shotgun piece about why <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/08/01/look-single-player-people-are-just-better/" target="_blank">single player gamers are a better ilk</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I stress again, I would hate it if I appeared pompous at all when I suggest that single-player gaming, ever-more the forgotten gem of our hobby, is for the more sophisticated, intellectual individual. It takes something more, a different kind of mind, a more educated, refined view, to understand and value the art of the single-player. Let me tell you why.</p>
<p>The worth of single-player comes in the form of narrative. As with any good novel, or a finely crafted film. It is the equivalent to literature. While multiplayer is an ill-informed argument. It has no direction, no beginning nor end, no meaning.</p>
<p>Games are made with intent. Like books, films and television, the finest examples among them are those that both exist to say something, but allow the player to create his own interpretation. And while of course there are any number of poor or stupid single-player games, there is no multiplayer that evenly closely matches the finest RPG or adventure.</p>
<p>Like I say, I would be just mortified if anyone interpreted these words to be snooty or condescending. I’m just saying people who prefer single player games are a better class than people who mostly opt for multiplayer.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.roflgames.com/DPadWebsite/www/index.htm" target="_blank"><em>Owlboy</em> will be released this year.</a> It’s one of the few platformers I’ve actually gotten excited about since <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/" target="_blank"><em>Doukustu Monogatari</em></a>.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkwgJK88Ajs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p>The demo should be released on August 20th.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The Independent Games Festival’s chairman, Brandon Boyer, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36571/GDC_Europe_We_Have_A_Responsibility_To_Support_Indies_Says_IGF_Chairman_Boyer.php#comment115948" target="_blank">calls for independent developers to push the limits of the game experience and for consumers to pay a fair wage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For too long we’ve been relying on this model that says that games are more or less interchangeable products, marketed and sold as products, and if they’re all just slight variations on the same theme, or if they do little more than give our thumbs something to do in idle time, of course we’re going to be wise shoppers and choose the cheapest among them.</p>
<p>An album purchased on iTunes can cost nearly ten times as much as most people are willing to spend on a game — even when that album itself is actually embedded in the game — [the slide here is of the $1.99 NOBY NOBY BOY app sitting right on top of the $11.99 NOBY NOBY BOY soundtrack] but by and large people don’t buy an album to listen to it once and complain it only took 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>People value music more because it adds an emotional pitch and rhythm and color to life, it speaks to something more essential, it reminds them of a place and time, it reminds them of where they were when they first experienced it and who they experienced it with.</p>
<p>And there’s no reason that we shouldn’t also be aspiring to that same exact sort of resonance in whatever small ways, crafting experiences that invite people to return to them, not because it extends a dollar value, but because it feels like a place they actually want to re-visit, or adds that same color and rhythm.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Lastly, here is a cinematic trailer for the <em>Guns of Icarus</em> MMO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are anything like me, you got sick of steampunk around the same time you stopped reading Boing Boing. My initial delight with steampunk is almost certainly connected to my love of good sci-fi and fantasy. The connection between magic and technology is nearly essential for the genre, if only for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>My techno-scientific geek brain knows that the devices like airships couldn’t work without some sort of alchemy.</li>
<li>The technology often is so advanced, despite its analog bent, that Clarke’s third law applies.*</li>
</ol>
<p>But after hundreds of cosplay pictures and derivative movies, comics, and video games, the novelty began to wear. Yet one day, about a year ago during a quiet afternoon of unemployment, I found myself playing a game described thusly, “In an apocalyptic steampunk future, you are a privateer ferrying goods across treacherous airspace. Protect your airship and yourself from an onslaught of pirates, and safely reach your destination to reap the rewards.”</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/6967593" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Admittedly, by the description, I was expecting something RPG-ish, a simple, stripped down <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skies_of_Arcadia" target="_blank">Skies of Arcadia</a> (an exceedingly wonderful Dreamcast game), but <a href="http://musegames.com/games/guns-of-icarus" target="_blank">Guns of Icarus</a> was decidedly not that and my expectation certainly explains some of the other reviews you can find online:</p>
<blockquote><p>You’ve already imagined something more spectacular than Guns of Icarus can offer. This third-person action game’s midbattle story panels may hint at such a time and place, but the game itself is a one-note diversion that tips its full hand within minutes of starting your first play-through. As it stands, there is a bare-bones version of the game you can already play for free within your Web browser. – Kevin VanOrd, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/gunsoficarus/review.html" target="_blank">Gamespot</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There is really no story here at all. Each level has a little postcard before it with some trite description of the hardships of that region, but there is no explanation whatsoever of the main character’s (note that I don’t use the word protagonist) motivations. Why is he delivering cargo? Why does it have to be in a Zeppelin? Who is he delivering to? Why does he commit suicide-by-pirate at the end? Why did he bring cargo with him when he went off to die? No explanation is given for anything, and the entire campaign is over in about 20 minutes. &#8211; CB Droege, <a href="http://gaming.icrontic.com/reviews/guns-of-icarus-review/" target="_blank">Icrontic</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These descriptions are as accurate as they are misguided. The game was originally developed for a <em>web browser</em>. I have never found a robust story in a browser based game (please prove me wrong), let alone one that lasts more than twenty minutes. Their beauty tends to be in simple, repetitive game machines, something fun to pick up now and again, play a quick round, and then get back to work. If that’s the standard, then this game shines brilliantly.</p>

<p>There are only really two game mechanics, shoot the attacking pirates and repair your ship. Each mission is measured by distance between the two locations you are carrying undescribed cargo to and from. En route you are assaulted, depending on difficulty, by three different sorts of aircraft who damage your will damage your engines (which will eventually halt your progress forward), cargo hold (you get ship upgrades, if you have enough cargo left over), rigging, and the zeppelin (which will make you explode). The longer the route you take in the campaign, the more upgrades you get, and the more prepared you are to go <strong>Into The Breach</strong>.</p>

<p>You can’t not die in The Breach, the entire point is to survive as long as possible by killing by managing your time killing air pirates and repairing your ship. Your distance meter ticks up, rather than down, and the further the distance, the further the bragging rights. The best part? Multiplayer co-op (up to four) with url-based invites which, combined with Twitter, would make it incredibly easy to have a mid-afternoon pick-up game.</p>
<p>Totally worth it for <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/49800" target="_blank">five bucks</a> (originally, ten for the full version), especially if you can sucker a few friends to buy it on a quiet Saturday afternoon.  And, if this game does tickle your steampunk funny bone, you should be aware <a href="http://gunsoficarus.com/community/blog/mechanical-renaissance/" target="_blank">an MMO is in development</a>.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>*For <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws" target="_blank">the non-geek</a>: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”</p>

<p>But some time, after <del datetime="2011-06-10T00:14:48+00:00">hundreds</del> (who am I kidding?) thousands of hours of gaming, if you are like me, you probably have become jaded. Like TV, film, and art, most games just suck and the more you play, the more you cultivate your taste, the more the sucktitude stands out.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easy to craft a narrative where the old games are always the best games: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango" target="_blank">The Grim Fandago</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_Mana" target="_blank">The Secret of Mana</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_II:_Battle_at_Antares" target="_blank">Masters of Orion 2</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_(series)" target="_blank">Baldur’s Gate</a> series, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Quake" target="_blank">Action Quake 2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Force_II" target="_blank">Shining Force II</a>, the list could go on. But we all know for every great game then, there were five games like <a href="http://www.seanbaby.com/nes/egm01.htm" target="_blank">Atari&#8217;s E.T.</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Atari manufactured five million E.T. cartridges, and according to Atari’s CEO, “nearly all of them came back.” It got to a point where the world’s children refused to take them for free. To put that into perspective, I’ve seen kids buy dead spiders from each other for a nickle. Calling this game a piece of trash is actually scientifically accurate because Atari eventually took their massive collection of useless E.T. cartridges and buried it in a New Mexico landfill. So if you ever lose your mind and want a copy of E.T., or maybe five million, grab a shovel and drive out to the desert. They’re free.</p></blockquote>
<p>The games industry, of course, is no worse or better off now than it was. The money grubbing media machines is still shoving crap games in our faces and the larger developers <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/05/19/rps-asks-do-you-care-about-early-reviews/" target="_blank">aren’t allowing early reviews</a> since it might hurt sales. The indie game scene is also a bit bloated, much of it derivative and boring, and the noise of the internet  is making it difficult to find real gems (don’t get me started on the SEO, snake-oil salesmanship) to squeeze into what little time we now have in our adult lives.</p>
<p>I want my games to feel magical. I want to feel like I did the first time I finished Salinger’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franny_and_Zooey" target="_blank">Franny and Zooey</a> in my early twenties: delighted, dismayed, confused, and given pause.</p>
<p>That is to say:</p>
<p>“Games aren’t giving me what I feel like I need.”</p>

<p>Done? Good (watching the above video is a moral imperative).</p>
<p>Now do me a favor and send me recommendations of those great games you’ve been playing, while I go  out and scour the internet. Let’s not waste our time anymore, let’s fill our days, games or otherwise, with greatness.</p>

<p>Well, sort of. Real men, as a friend quipped, kill Emerald Weapon, not Sephiroth, for old time’s sake. And, I suppose, he’s right, considering how easy it is to bear Sephiroth, but it doesn’t make me any less happy to be done with the game. Don’t here what I am not saying, I love <em>FFVII</em> but years later the flaws it has (and there are many) are more glaring at the age of thirty-one. I’ve complained a bit about <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/17/cid/">the puerility of some of the characters</a>, so I’ll spare you this time around (and it was written for teenagers, to be fair). There are a few of us, understandably who find <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/01/27/ffvii-swap-meet/">the materia and character management cumbersome</a>, but that is sort of a JRPG thing to do. Also, the last cutscenes don’t have any voice acting which, considering the grandness of them (for the time), seems off-putting. It’s almost as if they ran out of budget or were just in a rush. Then again, maybe modern games just have me spoiled.</p>
<p>Lastly, and I don’t think anybody has mentioned this, it doesn’t pass the beer and pizza test. Simply put, YOU HAVE TO PRESS A BUTTON TO RUN.  The moment I take one hand off the controller progress is slowed. That quick bite to eat or pull from a beer bottle interrupts the flow of the game. This, honestly, was the single most frustrating aspect of the RPG. Obviously, there are game genres, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idZ9C0Qtj2A">the classic platformer</a> is certainly one of them, where your only recourse is to pause to nibble and quaff, but any game that requires extensive walking, to help suggest the largeness of world, shouldn’t make use more than the controller&#8217;s left keypad to move. That’s just simply bad user experience. Period.</p>
<p>All that said, they didn’t cheat us by putting hours of required grinding like so many games do to extend the time of gameplay*. I blazed through the game in about nineteen hours with Cloud at level 68 (and I could have done it faster), using <a href="http://idler-mag.com/2011/02/10/ffvii-character-and-materia-management/">a pretty standard materia layout</a>. With such an easy last boss, the only real cookie they give you is the cut scene and glorious beatdown of Sephiroth at the end.</p>

<p>All the good stuff is really after you’ve completed the game, another whole twenty hours of content (level grinding, chocobo breeding and racing, Weapon killing, Knights-of-the-Round-getting) that was optional. And all of it takes time, effort, and skill which, I suppose, means I may never be a real man.</p>
