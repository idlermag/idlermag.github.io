										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“If you like <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> then you’ll love <em>Outcasts</em>!” At least that’s what the producers of <em>Outcasts</em> are probably hoping you’ll say. Unfortunately at only 8 episodes long, <em>Outcasts</em> is a mere shadow of the show it aspires to be.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Plot</strong><br />
Plots are hard! I know, it’s okay. The home planet of humans has been destroyed but a few scattered ships make it out alive and try to settle on a world they don’t know much about all the while a nefarious force is tracking them down. So, is this the plot of seasons 2/3 of <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> or the plot of <em>Outcasts</em>. It’s both, silly!</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Character</strong><br />
<em>BSG</em>’s Gaius Baltar is the unique combination of scientist, traitorous political officer, and religious leader. <em>Outcasts</em>’ Julius Berger is the unique combination of scientist, traitorous political officer, and religious leader.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Actor</strong><br />
Star power! <em>BSG</em> fan favorite Jamie Bamber appears briefly in <em>Outcasts</em>. He’s on the show long enough to get people who like <em>BSG</em> to start watching <em>Outcasts</em>, but not so long that casual viewers would start to pick up on how similar <em>Outcasts</em> is to <em>BSG</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Plot Element</strong><br />
Cylons: We created them and they turned on us so we tried to kill them and now they’re pseudo-humans who would like to see us destroyed, but we may have to try to live together. Advanced Cultivars: We created these pseudo-humans who turned on us after we tried to kill them and who would like to see us destroyed, but we may have to try to live together.</p>
<p><strong>Steal The Best Twists</strong><br />
One of the pseudo humans is amongst us unbeknownst to even her! Gaius/Julius is a traitor! There may be something more mystical going on that we can or want to understand!</p>
<p><em>Outcasts</em> is a decent show especially if you’re jonesing for something more with <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> off the air. Just set your expectations appropriately.</p>

Fezzes are cool.</p></div> My esteemed college and, more importantly, fellow Sarah, has asserted <a href="https://idlermag.com/2012/03/21/a-noob-watches-doctor-who/">Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor is the best Doctor</a>. While in every subjective way her opinion is well reasoned and valid, in every objective way her opinion is obviously ill-informed and invalid. Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor is the best of the modern Doctors. </p>
<p>My personal <em>Doctor Who</em> trajectory had me starting, like Sarah, with Nine and I&#8217;d also consider it blasphemy to skip him and go to Ten. But while I watched the modern series as it premiered, I also simultaneously watched some of the classic series thanks to the magic of Netflix. I&#8217;d jump from the grumpy First Doctor to the <em>joie de vivre</em> of the Ninth Doctor, then back to the flamboyant Fourth Doctor, then to the manic Tenth Doctor. The result being I never really imprinted on one particular Doctor or developed a certain expectation for the show. </p>
<p>For me, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether Eleven is the truest incarnation of earlier versions of The Doctor (he is) or whether he&#8217;s the most interesting portrayal of The Doctor (he is) or whether Matt Smith is just the most handsome of the three modern Doctors (oh, yes, he is). What matters is that Eleven is the most believable character. </p>
<p>All my problems with the Tenth Doctor and Russell T. Davies crystallized in the character&#8217;s finale where Ten has to decide whether to give his life for a human, an elderly man he had no particular connection to or affection for. Not the love of his life, not the president, not a child destined for greatness. Just a run-of-the-mill old guy who by his own admission will probably die in a couple years anyhow. </p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHMBxYXmrTw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>Look at you, not remotely important. But me, I could do so much more!</p></blockquote>
<p>I hate most vampires because they&#8217;re unrealistic, and I don&#8217;t mean the blood sucking part. If you are a thousand-year-old nearly invincible creature, why are you spending your time and energy becoming super BFFs with humans? </p>
<p>I mean, I have a cat. I love my cat. I&#8217;m going to outlive it and be sad when it dies. I&#8217;ll probably get a new cat after that. But no matter how much I love my cat, I&#8217;m not going to give my life for it or pretend my cat or cats in general have any sort of meaningful impact on my life or the world. In what functional way are humans different than cats when it comes to other worldly immortal beings? </p>
<p>Now in the Doctor&#8217;s case, sure, he&#8217;s the last of his kind so he&#8217;s going to get bored and lonely and want to befriend other creatures. I get why Ten finds humanity interesting and wants to hang out with humans. What I don&#8217;t understand is why Ten gets all weepy and martyrs himself for one lousy human. You&#8217;d never see Eleven (or any other Doctor (or any other ancient, nearly invincible being)) giving his life in such a meaningless bargain. He cares more about puzzles than people. </p>
<p>Eleven doesn&#8217;t give a shit. He&#8217;ll promise a kid he&#8217;ll be right back then take another ten or fifteen years to get around to it. Does he care about what he put that kid through? Eh, not really. He has no compunction about manipulating people or dropping them entirely. Hanging out with humans is a means to an end: fun. </p>
<p>Taken in isolation as a character, Eleven is unequivocally my favorite but when you start looking at plot, companions, and how it&#8217;s written generally then things get murkier. </p>

Davies tugs at your heart with dramatic emotional plots, Stephen Moffat tugs at your brain with complex intellectual plots. Eleven’s aloofness pairs well with Moffat’s cerebral writing. </p>
<p>When it comes to companions, I don&#8217;t love any of them, and Amy least of all. Her lack of agency in the show is disturbing. (I was really pregnant and in a vat the whole time!) Unfortunately what I love about the character of Eleven, I hate about the writer: Stephen Moffat is extremely misogynistic. From <em>Coupling</em> to <em>Sherlock</em> to <em>Doctor Who</em>, all his leads are characterized by a borderline pathological disregard for women. I still enjoy his shows but it&#8217;s not always easy. </p>
<p>As a show with decades of history and hundreds of people working on it, the quality of the episodes vary wildly. It&#8217;s almost impossible to be a fan of the show and love all of it. Of my DWho friends, I&#8217;m probably the most critical of the show. From the cheesy to the nonsensical to the overblown, for every one episode I love there&#8217;s probably two I hate. But the highs are high and they keep me coming back for more. </p>
<p>Because when you start in on <em>Doctor Who</em> you have to watch it for better or worse, in cheesiness and in earnestness, as long as you both shall endure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi, my name is Sarah and I&#8217;m an addict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I watched the entire series of <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/United_States_of_Tara/70142349?trkid=2361637">The United States of Tara</a> in 5 days. That&#8217;s 37 half hour episodes. I watched 13 episodes in one day. A Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently two days sober from Netflix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t understand. They think TV is just fun. A frivolous thing you can turn off whenever you like. And what do I know? Maybe that&#8217;s true for some people. Maybe most people have a point where they say &#8220;that&#8217;s enough&#8221; and they can just switch off the remote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your TV make noise? I still have one of those big boxy CRT televisions that makes this hum. It&#8217;s not something I hear so much as I feel. And it&#8217;s not even something I feel so much as I miss. When I turn off the TV there&#8217;s this crackling, like someone just opened a pressure valve and I can breathe again. I know I&#8217;m making it sound unhealthy, like the TV is suffocating me but just think of it like I do, as electronic swaddling. That hum is a seductive sotto voce murmur.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Press play. One more episode. Just one. Just one more. You want to know what comes next. While everything&#8217;s fresh, so fresh in your mind. Can&#8217;t you feel it crackling? That energy between us? It&#8217;s only twenty minutes. It&#8217;s only the rest of the night. It&#8217;s only the rest of the week.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>And then it&#8217;s over. Tara drives off into the sunset, head sticking out of her car window, leaving me back on Netflix&#8217;s menu screen, head sticking out of my duvet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&gt; Play episode one</em></p>
<p>Did I blackout? Where&#8217;d the last 5 days of my life go? Lost into the ether. And for what? <em>The United States of Tara</em> isn&#8217;t a bad show. Arguably it&#8217;s perfect for me. To deal with the stresses of life, Tara loses herself in herself. The rest of us lose ourselves in TV. In her. In her selves. Being just one person is too much for most people but look at all the people she can be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch any show in a marathon binge and you inevitably hate it. Like eating too much ice cream, after a while you stop tasting it because your mouth is too cold. You&#8217;re numb and nauseous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quirks become crutches. Characters become ciphers. Relateability becomes rote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the show&#8217;s fault. TV was designed to be shown one episode per week with commercials in-between. But, while I may be an extreme, who honestly watches TV like that anymore?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not doing a marathon streaming session, you watching episodes back to back on DVD. And if you&#8217;re not watching TV on DVD, then you&#8217;re watching it on Hulu or the show&#8217;s website where there few to no commercial breaks. And if you&#8217;re not watching online, you&#8217;re watching it on a DVR that allows you to fast forward through commercials. Even with live TV I often jump back to hear things I&#8217;ve missed then fast forward through a few commercials. We want more show. More show, less of everything else.</p>
<p>I quit cold turkey from Netflix streaming two days ago. Of course, I&#8217;ll be back. You shouldn&#8217;t plan on relapsing but I know it&#8217;ll happen soon enough. After all, I have to do another column next month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if there&#8217;ll be a software update while I&#8217;m gone. Maybe Netflix will get a play-all button.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/08/24/tonight-on-netflix/">last</a> <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/09/21/parallel-universes-in-which-netflix-becoming-qwikster-makes-sense/">few</a> <a href="https://idlermag.com/2011/11/16/from-cringe-to-cheer-the-evolution-of-foible-in-parks-recreation/">posts</a> for <em>The Idler</em>’s &#8220;In The Queue&#8221; column were enjoyable to write but a bit heady. I don’t really want to carve out the brainspace for a post that requires thinking. So instead of packing or cleaning or any of the other things I should do before I fly for the holidays I’m going to sit and watch the most enjoyably mediocre movie I can find and liveblog my watching of it. </p>
<p>I know as much about <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Limitless/70142827?trkid=3990682">Limitless</a> (2011) as <a href="http://splitsider.com/2011/11/the-office-recap-gettysburg">Phyllis from <em>The Office</em></a> does. “Isn&#8217;t that the one where the guy becomes limitless?” Sounds about right. Netflix predicts I’ll like it exactly 3 out of 5 stars which sounds perfectly mediocre to me. </p>
<p>From the description it seems sorta sci-fi. I always think that’ll be good but Hollywood usually has a way of mutilating anything remotely good into a pile of unwatchable mush (see: I dunno, I don’t really feel like thinking of examples right now). </p>
<p>Even seeing that Bradley Cooper stars doesn’t do much for me. I mean he’s like Double Stuff Oreos, I like them but I don’t want to marry them. Ewan McGregor would be coffee ice cream in this metaphor. I don’t feel like doing a deep think on what this metaphor actually means but you can probably draw some conclusions. Or not. </p>
<p>So we have a sorta sci-fi movie and a sorta attractive actor. Let’s start. Well. Let’s start after I eat some pizza.</p>
<p>Okay, now let’s start. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>These title cards are the definition of mediocre. This bodes well. White text in an ever-so-slightly grungy font on a black background. Thud, name, increase in size. Rinse and repeat. </p>
<p>Movie opens on Bradley Cooper character’s voice-over with some empty rooms and some dead guys. Supposedly sexy music, supposedly sexy outside shot of a building. Supposedly sexy Bradley Cooper teetering on the edge of said building. </p>
<p><em>“I’d come close to having an impact on the world now the only thing I’d have an impact on was the sidewalk.”</em> Life! It’s so hard for you, Bradley Cooper character! I hope we can flash back to find out how you metaphorically and literally rose to such heights only now to be on the precipice of destruction. I did say literally, right? Since for this whole scene he’s been standing on the wall of his penthouse patio contemplating jumping. </p>
<p>My sarcastic wish came true! We’re flashing back. </p>
<p><em>“You see that guy? That was me not so long ago. What kind of guy without a drug or alcohol problem looks this way? Only a writer.”</em> Or a hobo. or a college professor. Or anyone who’s afraid of barbers. </p>
<p>Ooh, writers writing about writers. Yay. But I guess I’m a writer writing about a writer writing about a writer writing. Who’s doing the shitty voiceover now, Sarah? </p>
<p>Okay, no wait, I should try not to hate this. This is supposed to be the mediocre movie I turn my brain off for. Because a movie explicitly about turning your brain on is the perfect time for that. Oops, I just feel asleep. Wish this were hilarious internet sarcasm, instead it’s just hilarious Sarah narcolepsy. Pushing ahead. </p>
<p><em>“Home. But it couldn’t be my home could it? Who would live like this?”</em> Okay I like that line, emphasizes the before/after personality this movie is pushing. </p>
<p><em>“That doesn’t sounds very FDA approved.”</em> Really, this unlabelled drug that you never seriously questioned and just popped without knowing what it is: Did you think this was something on the shelf you just didn’t know about? </p>
<p>&#8220;I’m gonna stuff these drugs down my pants then open the door for the cops. I am Bradley Cooper. This is my excellent plan.&#8221; I’m trying my hand at voiceover for this movie. What do you think? Yeah it’s not very good. Maybe I should pop some of that limitless drug and try agian. </p>
<p>Ah ha, he finally popped a pill. Oh thank god, he immediately went to get a haircut. Bradley Cooper is already not my cup of tea but he’s particularly unattractive in hobo chic. But really, he’s like that teen movie girl who took off her glasses and was suddenly pretty. You learned how to use a comb. You’re so irresistible now, Bradley Cooper! </p>
<p><em>“I suddenly knew everything about everything.”</em> I want to know everything about everything! This movie speaks so directly to people like me (everybody) and the stuff I like (everything). </p>
<p>&#8220;I’m Bradley Cooper driving a car really fast. Now I’m Bradley Cooper jumping off a cliff. I’m so limitless!&#8221; I think my voiceover attempts are getting better, you guys. </p>
<p><em>“Next day, $7500. Too slow.”</em> Bradley Cooper’s money is not limitless! </p>
<p><em>“Time somebody shook up the free world and got things done.”</em> What a grandiose voiceover statement. I see why they pay screenwriter-whose-name-I’m-not-going-to-bother-looking-up the big bucks. This is such an innocuous statement. In no way could this be setting things up for a downfall.  </p>
<p><em>“Suddenly there was another skip. How had I gone the last 20 blocks?”</em> Oh no, it’s a downfall! </p>
<p><em>“A fight? I don’t know how to fight. Or do I?”</em>  Wow, first legit good scene of the movie. Bradley Cooper character has flashbacks to half-remembered fight moves he saw on TV while he’s fighting this gang of randoms on a subway platform. Can the whole movie be this, please? Make it all <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/"><em>Memento</em></a> meets <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479884/"><em>Crank</em></a>. I would watch the shit out of that movie. </p>
<p>So now he’s not taking NZT because he ran out or because he’s scared he lost the last 18 hours of his life? I might be more easily drawn into these scenes if I knew his motivation. Maybe. </p>
<p><em>“Was it possible? Could I have killed someone? Was it even me?”</em> Good questions, ham-fisted voiceover! Will you answer these with ham-fisted answers later on? (Spoiler: Not really. Like everything in this movie it’s a plot device.) </p>
<p>Why does everyone call Bradley Cooper’s character on his landline? When was this script written? Am I really supposed to believe his landline is bugged but his cell is not?  </p>
<p><strong>INTERLUDE:</strong> How did Bradley Cooper win sexiest man alive? He’s so boring looking. This movie hasn’t cut away from a close shot of his face for more than 4 seconds at a time. I’m so tired of your face Bradley Cooper. At least do some sort of <em>Fear Factor</em>, <em>Blair Witch</em> sort of perspective cop out if I’m going to have to keep looking at this same shot of your face for 2 hours. </p>
<p>Oh no, ex-wife took some limitless and now she’s all fucked up. What a downer Bradley Cooper character had to visit her the one day he was off the drugs. What a grey pair they make. This is that point in the movie when I’m supposed to feel sad right? I hope they hand out autistic emotion cards at screenings so us plebeians not on NZT limitless drug can express exactly how we feel about this movie. </p>
<p>Oh good, mafia guy is back. Why the hell did Bradley Cooper not pay him back when he was all high on limitless and shit?  That seems like a serious oversight for a guy who’s taking drugs that allow him to use 100% of his brain. I can be hungover, busy, sleepy, whatever and I still remember to pay my rent. Why can’t Bradley Cooper character have remembered to take out some of his $22 million to pay off the guy who threatened to cut him through at the waist. Oh now the mafia guy shook him down and found the NZT pill and popped it. That pill doesn’t even look like drugs. It’s clear. It looks like one of those sticky rubber stoppers you’d put on a kitchen drawer to keep it from slamming when you closed it. I wonder how many rubber stoppers this mafia guy has swallowed in his life hoping they were drugs. </p>
<p><em>“It was supposed to be legal.”</em> What? No it wasn’t. It never was. Why do you keep saying that, Bradley Cooper character? You never had any illusions that it was. </p>
<p>And now the guy that was chasing Bradley Cooper character is now chasing Bradley Cooper character’s girlfriend. Run BCCG, run! Wow, gilfriend’s got legs. But, no, she’s trapped. Trapped behind a rock with only 8 or 9 different places to escape to. Or not move. That’s an option that seems to be working for you. If the killer hasn’t found you yet running shouldn’t be your priority. <em>“You’ll think your way out.”</em> That’s not a particularly convincing argument to start taking drugs. Especially drugs that Bradley Cooper character’s girlfriend just saw are killing Bradley Cooper’s character.  No girl, don’t listen to him. Oh, but you do. Wait, that’s the spectacular plan that you thought of with your big limitless brain? Hit this guy in the face with some ice skating kid? Totally logical. </p>
<p>Now it’s the next morning and she regrets what she did. Women, amiright? One minute they’re all “yes I’ll begrudgingly take these drugs that’ll save my life” and the next minute they’re all “I totally begrudge these drugs that saved my life.” </p>
<p>Merger montage. Boring. Time to pause and read some Twitter. Also boring. Back to boring part of movie. </p>
<p><em>“You’re careless with those powers.”</em> So insightful, Robert De Niro character. I’m sure Bradley Cooper character is totally going to take that advice to heart. </p>
<p>20 minutes from the end of the movie and we’ve wrapped back around to the opening. Gonna slap a button on this and let him kill himself maybe? </p>
<p><em>“The last of it was in this mug’s bloodstream.”</em> We’ve all been there. Rock bottom. Drinking a guy’s blood off the floor. This movie is finally starting to get real. </p>
<p><em>“And it was all still possible.”</em> What? Bradley Cooper character is the front runner for Senate? Ugh, does this movie have a happy ending? </p>
<p>So Robert De Niro has bought the company that makes NZT. Why did Bradley Cooper character all hopped up on the drug not think to do that first? But if he can&#8217;t even remember to pay off the mafia guy, what can you expect. </p>
<p><em>“That van is gonna rear end that taxi.”</em> Fuck you. Fuck you movie. You just turned the anti-hero into a Matrix-like demigod? I figured a Hollywood happy ending would be unavoidable but this pisses me off. Also: why was Bradley Cooper character the first one to think to do this? Because he had such a huge supply? </p>
<p>Moral of the story: have an unlimited supply of drugs and everything will turn out awesome. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Final thoughts? This was exactly as mediocre as I expected/hoped it’d be. If I were rewriting it, for starters, it’d star Ewan McGregor. Though that’s sort of a non-thinking cop out since I mentioned him at the start. But hey. He’s DREAMY and he could play ANYTHING and also SHUT UP. Also I’d take out anything where people use landlines. This is 2011, that 2002 shit don’t fly. Then I’d go full <em>Memento</em>/<em>Crank</em> and make him a hopped up memory-fragmented junkie who has to keep moving or he’ll die. Or make it a story that has consequences: he dies strung out on the drug but maybe has a last moment of redemption. Something that isn’t this please-everybody Hollywood schlock. But that’s probably too much to ask.  </p>
<p>Conclusion? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Limitless/70142827?trkid=3990682">Limitless</a> would be a worthwhile way to kill two hours of your brain-dead, non-limitless life if I didn’t just shit all over it and ruin the ending. Happy Netflixing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to recommend a TV show to people and, in the same breath, say “skip the first season.”* “The whole season?” they’ll ask suspiciously, “why?” “Well it’s only six episodes,” you’ll sheepishly reply, “and the show is completely different from that now.”</p>
<p>That’s not hyperbole. <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Parks_and_Recreation/70143842?trkid=2361637">Parks &amp; Recreation</a> originally started as a spinoff of <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Office_U.S./70136120?trkid=2361637">The Office</a> which was also a spinoff of <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/The_Office_U.K./70136112?trkid=2361637">the UK show by the same name</a>. The original UK show, along with other shows like <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Curb_Your_Enthusiasm/70143814?trkid=2361637">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, are considered <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy">cringe comedy</a>.</p>
<p><em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> isn’t alone in it’s subject matter or style. <em>The Office</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> actually have even more in common: NBC’s current Thursday block are all shows about friends of circumstance. <em>30 Rock</em>, <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>, <em>Community</em>, and <em>The Office</em> all deal with groups of people who probably wouldn’t have been friends outside of the work/school circumstance that threw them together. For me, the strength of the show is proportional to the amount of time we see these people outside of the structures that brought them together and, in this regard, <em>Community</em> and <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> excel.</p>
<p>Last year I tried to devise a Grand Unified Theory of Comedy. Cringe comedy is a tough thing to nail down. Why is it when a character does something dumb that some people will laugh out loud while others wince and turn away? I think it comes down to the empathy line. Each person has their own internal tipping point where, beyond it, they relate with a character to an extent that they empathize with what’s happening and can’t find it funny. But empathy being both personal and a spectrum means some people laugh out loud at <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> and others can’t even bear to watch it.</p>
<p>I explain all this by way of saying that <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> started out as cringe comedy but over the last two seasons it’s moved the empathy line and is now one of the most inclusive, feel good, <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/05/the-weird-frictionless-politics-of-parks-and-recreation">twee</a> shows ever. This, even more than being one of the funniest shows on TV right now, is its most massive accomplishment.</p>
<p>Still not sure what I mean? The easiest way to show the difference in tone between the start of the show and where it is today is the credits. In <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWOZVz9OVnk">the first season credits</a> everyone is grimacing: local government, so irritating! But they revamped the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXNDJnwpvig">credits for the third season</a>: look at how happy everyone is! Don’t you want to watch a show with all these happy people?</p>
<p>How did all these characters become so happy? In season one it was Leslie Knope against the world. Her boss Ron was indifferent, her subordinate Tom was incompetent, and everyone in the government and the town was brutish. But by season three her boss Ron is hands-off, her subordinate Tom is misguided, and everyone in the town is eccentric. It’s a subtle but important shift not just in the way the story and characters are structured but in the way we appreciate the show.</p>
<p>Mark was a central part of the small season one cast but his role of the everyman/love interest was replaced by Ben, an objectively superior character, at the end of season two.  Mark was the stock foil, <em>a la</em> Jim from <em>The Office</em>: generically nice, no strong perspective, an easy cipher for the audience. He’s a mile-wide, inch-deep character that’s great for turning to the camera and shrugging but not much else.</p>
<p>In the last episode of the first season Mark and Leslie kiss and when Leslie stops him Marks says “don’t worry, it’s not a big deal.” It’s this low-stakes, lack of investment that is a hallmark of cringe comedy and which really hurts the character of Mark, any relationships he has, and the show generally. Conversely when Ben expresses his feelings for Leslie it’s done in a high-stakes, grounded relationship which becomes a central focus for the show.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Pawnee is a really special town. I love living there. And I look forward to the moments in my day where I get to hang out with the town. And talk to the town about stuff. And the town has really nice blond hair too, and has read a shocking number of political biographies for a town, which I like.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s affection communicated not just from Ben to Leslie but also from the audience to the characters. When Mark told Leslie “Don’t worry, it’s not a big deal,” that was the same as the audience dismissing Leslie, our protagonist, which is why we cringe. But Ben is embracing Leslie and embracing the increasingly wacky world of <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> and is saying, as the audience cipher, “you’re weird and that’s great.” They’ve moved the empathy line so instead of marginalizing out main character in a smaller realistic world, they’ve created a bigger fictional world in which our protagonist is idolized.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://splitsider.com/2011/08/the-story-of-this-story-is-that-it-wont-stop-developing-the-media-in-parks-and-recreation">town-as-character</a> aspect of <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> is one of the show’s greatest strengths in its evolution from cringe to cheer. In cringe comedy we rely not on invention but convention; the banality is what allows us to cross that empathy line and easily project ourselves onto the characters. For example, in the eight years that <em>The Office</em> has been on the air I’ve learned nothing interesting about the town of Scranton other than it has two <a href="http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/Scranton#Alfredo.27s_Pizza_Cafe">similarly named pizza places</a>. By creating a fictional town full of rich characters, <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> is creating a microcosm of a world with its own unique perspective. This, again, moves the empathy line letting us relate to the characters on their own terms as opposed to viewing them through the prism of how they relate to us. The adorably inept local media are sharks, the internet is stuck in the AltaVista days, the neighboring town is full of preposterously pompous snobs. This richly layered backdrop allows even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_of_Parks_and_Recreation#Orin">a character who’s never said anything</a> to be memorable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the transition from cringe to cheer hasn’t worked well for every character.  The short first season had only one plot, the pit, which revolved around Ann. There was a lot of conflict for her to wrestle with and we got to see her relationships grow, particularly her friendship with Leslie. But once the focus broadened beyond the pit Ann got lost in the shuffle. She’s still stuck in the cringe comedy mindframe: alternately dating, breaking up with, and trying to get back together with boyfriends of all kinds, with no discernible personality. Even when the writers finally realized the had to involve her more centrally in the plot that just amounted to a part time job at City Hall. But it’s not enough; she still drifts through each episode unmoored. In the most recent episode she follows Ron around for no real reason helping to fix things in Andy and April’s house. Every character has a strength, and I hope the writers find Ann’s. They need to either <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlP_3e9RDxE">double down with her</a> like they did with Tom and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX0ZF8f8G0A">Entertainment 720</a> or put her out to pasture like they did Mark.</p>
<p>Forged in the <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152007&amp;trkid=3327070&amp;t=Parks+and+Recreation%3A+Ssn+1%3A+The+Reporter">season one</a> fires of cringe comedy, <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em> has earned <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmhohRXn_LY">its adorableness</a>.</p>
<p><i>*So, where should you start? <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152011&amp;trkid=3327070&amp;t=Parks+and+Recreation%3A+Ssn+2%3A+Pawnee+Zoo">Season 2 episode 1</a> if you want a fuller arc, or <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=70152033&amp;trkid=3327070&amp;t=Parks+and+Recreation%3A+Ssn+2%3A+Master+Plan">season 2 episode 23</a> if you want to jump to the introduction of Ben.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Doing Two Things Is Confusing</strong><br />
The year is 2000, Amazon, the burgoning internet book seller, splits off their new music department into a website called Nile.com. By 2011 every river has a .com address and is a commerce portal operated by Amazon.com. Over the next 10 years the internet is entirely dominated by single-serving sites. Subdomains don’t exist and more than 8 characters after the .com is considered obscene. As Netflix’s streaming catalog threatens to overshadow its classic DVD by mail program a bewildered public and confused stock market force Netflix to spin off its flagship productline into a new company for clarity’s sake. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Sadists</strong><br />
Fuck you for using our service. No seriously, fuck you. Oh you were just about to finish that streaming movie? <a href="http://www.hackingnetflix.com/2010/08/does-netflix-give-enough-warning-when-streaming-titles-expire.html" target="_blank">NOPE.</a> Expired. Fuck off.  Oh, you want another DVD? <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11262292/ns/business-us_business/t/frequent-netflix-renters-sent-back-line/" target="_blank">NOPE.</a> Slow your roll, asshole. Oh hey, do you want to connect with friends and privately share ratings and recommendations? <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/friends-update.html" target="_blank">NOPE</a>. Maybe try Facebook instead? <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/01/connecting-with-your-friends-on-netflix.html" target="_blank">OH NO WAIT FUCK THAT SHIT.</a> And hey, our way of saying thanks for those years of thoughtful reviews you wrote: <a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2011/06/minor-update-to-member-reviews.html" target="_blank">STRIPPING ATTRIBUTION.</a> No one wants to know your name, bitch. Hey at least our website is easy to use. Do a search and if it’s streaming watch it now, if it’s on DVD add it to your queue. <a href="http://twitpic.com/6n72lq" target="_blank">HAHA FUCK YOU SEARCH TWICE.</a> </p>
<p><strong>Netflix is Run By Masochists</strong><br />
What do you mean you like my variety? I hate that about myself. The future isn’t in discs and my present streaming selection sucks. My core business model is a joke. Spank me on the stock market, abuse me in my comment threads. I deserve it. I don’t know why you keep giving me money anyways. I know everyone is mocking me when they call things “the Netflix of whatever”.  I know they just mean the new failure. I’m going to go cut myself. </p>
<p><strong>Netflix Is Having An Identity Crisis</strong><br />
I’m chopping off my hair, kicking out my core business, and uprooting myself to a different domain. You can call me Starchild Qwikster.  Netflix is my slave name. </p>
<p><strong>All of These Domains Were Already Taken</strong><br />
Flix.com<br />
Redenvelope.com<br />
Netdiscs.com<br />
Netdisx.com<br />
Maildiscs.com<br />

<p><strong>Netflix: White Collar Squatter</strong><br />
Unhappy with their business model, Netflix decided to follow Google’s. They choose an impossible to remember company name then buy every spelling permutation to show ads against. </p>
<p><strong>Qwikster: Pawn in Corporate Chess</strong><br />
Netflix puts Qwikster up for sale. Amazon buys Qwikster. Netflix buys Hulu. Apple files anti-duopoly lawsuit.  Amazon merges with Netflix, hostilely takes over Apple. Government breaks up iFlixzon. Qwikster only viable model after internet razing war. </p>
<p><strong>An Offer Netflix Can&#8217;t Refuse</strong><br />
In exchange for rights to stream high quality movies, the studios extracted extraordinary measures from Netflix. </p>
<ol>
<li>Reed Hastings&#8217;s must visit each of the studio heads personally and sing &#8220;I am a little teapot.&#8221;</li>
<li>The studios kidnapped Reed Hastings&#8217;s daughter and if he didn&#8217;t comply they&#8217;d sign her to a three picture deal with Eddie Murphy. </li>
<li>In a fit of Scrabble-induced pique, the studios demanded that Netflix must spin off its DVD by mail service into a new website that uses a Q, W, and K, but only two vowels. </li>
<li>The new site cannot use any of Netflix&#8217;s APIs and must be coded by out-of-work humanities PhDs given an <em>HTML For Dummies</em> book. </li>
<li>Netflix is not allowed to blame or even mention the studios as its rationale for these changes. </li>
</ol>
