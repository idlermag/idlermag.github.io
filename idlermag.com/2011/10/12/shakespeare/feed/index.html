					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/10/12/shakespeare/#comment-2149&quot;&gt;amandafrench&lt;/a&gt;.

We did talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Shakespeare_Retold/70070427&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Shakespeare Retold&lt;/a&gt; but I missed it before it got taken off streaming! I&#039;m hoping it will come back soon, because I, like legions of others, did not choose to pay extra to get the occasional DVD in the mail in addition to streaming. If you&#039;re a Shakespeare fan, think about Christine Edzard&#039;s AYLI. I&#039;m not quite sure what I think of it--it&#039;s set in London&#039;s Docklands, so it&#039;s vision of the pastoral is quite different from what we&#039;d usually get, and I like it for that. And if you like sex/violence, you MUST watch the Cox &lt;em&gt;Revengers Tragedy&lt;/em&gt;. It&#039;d actually be worth switching over to DVD to see it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Like! Wow, there&#039;s lots here I hadn&#039;t heard of. I&#039;m one of those odd people who likes to watch Shakespeare movies. My reason, I think, is that I can watch some damn good lowbrow sex and violence tales while pretending to be highbrow. 

I remember seeing Marlowe&#039;s Edward II in the theater when it came out -- had no idea he&#039;d done The Tempest, too. Might do that this very evening: I&#039;m intrigued. Ditto Brook&#039;s Lear.

I think I&#039;ve recommended this to you before, Sarah, but I must also recommend the Shakespeare Retold series (annoyingly spelled as ShakespeaRetold or some damn thing, though I think the Netflix search will find either). Used to be on Instant Streaming, but now it&#039;s not. There are four modernized versions of Shakespeare&#039;s plays in the series -- basically they keep the plot but translate it for modern times and throw out (most of) the language. The Midsummer Night&#039;s Dream is terrible, the Much Ado is cute and worth watching, the Macbeth is flawed but is a great adaptation, and the Taming of the Shrew is downright addictively hilarious.]]></description>
