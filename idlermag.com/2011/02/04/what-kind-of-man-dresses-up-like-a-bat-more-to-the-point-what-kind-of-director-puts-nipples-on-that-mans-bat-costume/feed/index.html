					<description><![CDATA[1 - Thank and thank you.

2 - Batman and Robin is a headache, yes. 

3 - I will not stop knocking Batman Returns! It&#039;s ok. It&#039;s certainly NOWHERE near the attriocity that is Batman and Robin (Or even Batman Forever, for that matter), but it&#039;s definitely a step down for me from Batman (89). I especially stand by the fact that the Penguin sucks (in all incarnations thus far) and Catwoman (tends) to be lame as well. Pfeiffer is playing an S &#038; M version of the Julie Newmar interpretation.

4 - Sharks rarely hang onto their victims as they&#039;re dragged from the water without pulling off whole chunks. Does that repellent work underwater as well? You bet your sweet bippy it does.

5 - That&#039;s phenomenal.

					<description><![CDATA[Hi!  A few things:

1-  I loved this article. :)  Kerfluffle!  I love that word.

2- I completely agree with you about Batman and Robin.  Ick.

3- Stop knocking Batman Returns.  I don&#039;t care what you say.  I love Catwoman!  I can ignore everything else.

4-  I love that you mentioned the Shark Repellent.  That is my favorite part. 

5- In honor of Batman week I made the 1960&#039;s TV theme my ringtone.]]></description>
