					<description><![CDATA[Before our FFVII project, I began playing FFIV for the first time ever (the DS remake). Being used to, and a fan of, the FFVII Cid, the FFIV incarnaton took some getting used to--but, I grew to like the character. 

But, I agree that a counter-point to the rest of the emo cast would have been nice--like if the FFVII Cid had been more of a charming swashbuckler, pulp/serial hero type, but one who was past his glory years and refusing to own up to it. &quot;Chin up, Cloud! It&#039;s time for adventure!  ...To the Airship!&quot;]]></description>
