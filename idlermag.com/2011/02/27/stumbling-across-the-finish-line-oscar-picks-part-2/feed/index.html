For the record I have no problem with Natalie Portman winning. She&#039;s very good in a very demanding role. It&#039;s just that Jennifer Lawrence&#039;s performance had me more emotionally involved.

The King&#039;s Speech is very good and it&#039;s exactly the kind of movie the Academy tends to dig. Overall I think that The Social Network is just a far more impressive movie to have pulled off so well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I noticed, now that the oscars are over and the winners have all won, that you were right on a good portion of who was going to win. I agree that The Social Network should have won best picture. I did not think that The Kings Speech was nearly as good of a movie, neither in acting or how it was made. I disagree that Natalie Portman should not have won Best Actress in a Leading Role though. C&#039;mon Kev! She was brilliant! Otherwise I agree with you on most of these....we will have a discussion later....promise.]]></description>
