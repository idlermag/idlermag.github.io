Yeah, I don&#039;t know that Vincent is right, but I was reading his comments the same way. There&#039;s a lot of doubt at this point in the game, and that&#039;s kind of a cool thing--and something that you&#039;d miss a part of if you don&#039;t pick up Vincent.]]></description>

Yeah, I&#039;m kind of counting on it. After all, it&#039;s hard to be a Final Fantasy fan and not know what happens at the end of disc 1, even if you&#039;ve never actually played the game. :-)]]></description>

Gavin, when the holes in Cloud&#039;s memory are pieced back together, IMHO, it beats the insanity of seeing the end of disk one for the first time. Just you wait.]]></description>

If you can boost a player&#039;s Luck and Dexterity stats, I think that helps your stealing success rate. 

I could be wrong about Sephiroth&#039;s age, but that&#039;s how I took Vincent&#039;s cryptic information--it certainly would not be out of the question (look at Attack of the Clones or even Bladerunner for &quot;young&quot; adult characters).

I&#039;m hoping to get more story soon too--I just got to the Temple of the Ancients. I&#039;m closing in on the end of Disc 1.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had the worst luck with stealing. No Atomic Scissors. Not a single gold armlet. I&#039;ve basically given up on it.

And I&#039;m dying for more story! Sephiroth only five years old? Holy crap. Also, I know enough about pieces of Cloud&#039;s background that I&#039;m willing to go with the holes in his memory, but I&#039;m hoping that there&#039;s some more explanation of Tifa coming. If she knows that Cloud&#039;s memories don&#039;t add up, why is she being quiet about it?]]></description>
