					<description><![CDATA[While I haven&#039;t played the Lego games, I just recently came to a similar conclusion concerning inFAMOUS. It is a great game, both sides of the story are compelling and fun, but I don&#039;t understand the need for 350 blast shards.

I am content with 346, i believe.]]></description>
