					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s pretty much exactly how i felt! The movie was nostalgic and fun, but a tiny bit too saccharine for my taste. I remember the Muppets as being a bit more gritty, with Miss Piggy switching from gooey to karate in a split second. More explosions and adult humor hidden in there with the squishy puppets. I also wish the classic characters would&#039;ve had more screen time over the newby Walter and his human pals. It made we want to go out and buy all the old ones and watch them, which is definitely not a bad thing!]]></description>
