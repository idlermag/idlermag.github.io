					<description><![CDATA[Tip from Rick -- before cooking any meat, always add salt and pepper. For some reason that man can make anything have flavor. Look forward to seeing you in a few days darling!]]></description>

I actually live in fear of doing that, so I always end up just cooking it on high for a shorter period of time and having a really late dinner, rather than leaving the crock pot on low all day. The likelihood of burning my house down just seems way too high :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I made a white bean chicken chili the other week, but got stuck at work/class while the meat cooked...for 11 hours.  The recipe called for 3-5.  So I know exactly what you mean about adding broth until it looks edible.  Adventures in cooking!!]]></description>

I&#039;m both terrified of undercooking and paranoid about burning things. It&#039;s a problem. Thanks for reading, miss Amy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on the overcooking turkey. I love cooking complicated things, but give me a simple piece of chicken (or ground turkey) and all of a sudden I&#039;m a kid without training wheels for the first time. Am I overcooking it? It can&#039;t be done yet, right? Probably I&#039;m going to give everyone food poisoning, right?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you messed up cooking it--ground turkey on its own is pretty tasteless. I only use it when I know I&#039;m going to be adding a lot of flavor. Still, sounds delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it soup yet? I could almost smell it from Michigan. Looking forward to trying this recipe because we had a dozen pumpkins to get rid of and I am looking for ways to cook with it.  I think I might try this recipe with leftover thanksgiving turkey. ( if there is any!)

 I saw a recipe for pumpkin pancakes!  We are having fresh pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving!  Maybe that is why your nickname is &quot;punkun&quot; !]]></description>
