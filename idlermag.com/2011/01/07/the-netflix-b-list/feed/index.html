					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/01/07/the-netflix-b-list/#comment-759&quot;&gt;Kevin Mattison&lt;/a&gt;.

I can agree with you on everyone looking alike in &quot;Centurion&quot;. It&#039;s funny, Michael Fassbender is an actor who keeps getting tons of buzz (he was in Inglourious Basterds and will be Magneto in X-Men: First Class) and I find him to be totally anonymous. 10 mins. after watching &quot;Centurion&quot;, I couldn&#039;t have picked him out of a line up if my life depended on it. That being said, I dig survival movies like that (The Warriors, Deliverance, Southern Comfort) and I&#039;m a sucker for Roman history.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Sometimes, I’ll lose a whole hour of my life to aimlessly scanning the catalogue finding myself attracted to so many movies of so many genres, that I don’t know what to pick.&quot;

I can totally relate.  I&#039;ve run out of the free time I actually had to watch a movie by searching for said movie.  Finally I&#039;ll make a decision and then throw it in the instant queue to be watched later.  When I come back later I am incapable of resisting the urge to search through the whole catalogue over again.

Zardoz is totally getting played next time we have people over drinking.  Thanks for the recommendation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I dug Centurion too, although it was a bit monotonous and it probably would&#039;ve been smart for Marshall to have come up with some visual distinctions for everyone.  All those dudes looked exactly the same to me, particularly during battle sequences.

And Tom Hardy is definitely an actor to keep an eye on, especially with his role in Inception and the upcoming Dark Knight Rises.

Side note: That Sean Connery photo haunts me.]]></description>
