That&#039;s a great point. The further we get from any given time period, the more caricaturized it becomes. Looking to other period films instead of the period itself will eventually leave us with Halloween-costume like representations. I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s some unwritten rule that too much time-period recreation will frighten contemporary audiences, or if the industry is just apathetic about the whole thing ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;(“A film in the 20s? Okay, we need. . . red lipstick, and. . . a bob haircut. And one of those huge radios that looks like a sideboard. Voila! We’re done!”)&quot;

I feel like often times filmmakers are making period films based on OTHER period films, and not the period itself. More specifically, they are making homage films, like the Coen brothers great homage to the gangster film, &quot;Miller&#039;s Crossing&quot;, but less intentional.

Biopics are tricky because they need to both inform and entertain. There are many amazing people in this world who have done amazing things. Not ALL of them would make for a great film subject. Let&#039;s face it, sometimes the trip there just isn&#039;t that dramatically interesting! 

I&#039;m looking forward to checking out &quot;Howl&quot;, and I am a big fan of &quot;Milk&quot; as well.]]></description>
