					<description><![CDATA[I have that same guide! Mine is vintage, baby. Bought it back in 1997 when I originally got the game. I have been using it a bit, mainly to keep track of where I am, so I know what to write about.

I stole the Atomic Scissors too--but it did not take me too long (just lucky, I guess). But, there are plenty of typos and bad advice here and there--not to mention, the spoilers galore. 

I still have my guide for Earthbound somewhere too (it even came with the game).]]></description>
