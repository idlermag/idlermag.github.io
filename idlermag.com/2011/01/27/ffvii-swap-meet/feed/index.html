Blue mages are just useless unless you keep them in the party all the time and you let them take hits and wait and hope that someone uses a special attack on them. And that they survive it. And why would I keep someone useless in the party? It&#039;s a vicious cycle.]]></description>

The nearest thing I got to liking a blue mage is the Enemy Skill materia in FFVII. At least you could equip that to different players. 

Man, I miss the switching on the fly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you 100%. It&#039;s a great deal of effort to de-equip a character&#039;s materia before taking them out of the combat party, and far, far worse when you forget to do so and then spend a great deal of time in an area that doesn&#039;t let you make changes to the main group.

And I loved switching on-the-fly in FFX. It was a bit inconvenient to try and get everyone into every battle so that they&#039;d level up, but I could switch Kimahri in, let him take a hit, and then send him back to the bench. (I didn&#039;t love Kimahri. I don&#039;t love blue mages.) Compared to FFVII, it&#039;s a breeze.]]></description>
