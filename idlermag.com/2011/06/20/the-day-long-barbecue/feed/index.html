					<description><![CDATA[One time, before my grandmother bought me a food processor, I &quot;mashed&quot; chili with a potato masher instead of blending half of it as I was instructed to. It didn&#039;t turn out great. But, I also wanted to say that your popsicles from last week reminded me that you can make banana ice cream with just bananas!

You&#039;re not five.&quot;... but that makes me even sadder and I resolve to buy them the next time I see them... and then it&#039;s the same thing.
