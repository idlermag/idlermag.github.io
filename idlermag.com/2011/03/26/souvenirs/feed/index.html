					<description><![CDATA[So this is where you&#039;ve gone instead of your other blog. I might have known.

I heard once that men don&#039;t tend to collect photographs of their friends and former lovers the way women do. Instead, men tend to collect things for their memories. T-shirts, gifts, and other ephemeral are what men hang on to instead of photos. From where I&#039;m sitting in my living room I can see the tumbler that came with the first bottle of Scotch I ever bought on my 21st birthday, the vertebrae I found in the prairie around Laramie, WY when I was there for a debate camp with my friend Josh, and the sleeping domo kun toy my friend Pam gave me. If you are of a similar turn of mind, does this habit add more fuel the already well stoked fire that you are &quot;mannish&quot; in your outlook?

I also recently read that people with more bumper stickers on their cars experience more road rage. The suggestion was that the more bumper stickers you have, the more you&#039;re &quot;marking your territory&quot; and thus the angrier you get when it is threatened or violated. I see it as a sign of progress for humanity because bumper stickers smell a lot better than piss.]]></description>
