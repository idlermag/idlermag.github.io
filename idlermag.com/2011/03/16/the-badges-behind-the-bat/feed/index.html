					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2011/03/16/the-badges-behind-the-bat/#comment-1195&quot;&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt;.

There&#039;s a nice bit by Rucka at the beginning of the &quot;Half a Life&quot; trade volume of Gotham Central where he responds to people who complain that he &quot;made&quot; Montoya gay--which in an authorial sense, is literally true--by saying that he always saw the character as gay. Considering that Rucka is also beind the similarly wonderful &lt;i&gt;Batwoman: Elegy&lt;/i&gt;, I&#039;d love to see him speak more on the topic, but he seems to be fairly and usefully reticent on the topic in a way that reflects well on his writing. Renee Montoya and Kate Kane being gay is simply part of who they are--it&#039;s a defining trait for both of them, but it&#039;s not &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; defining trait for both of them.

Seriously, if you haven&#039;t read &lt;i&gt;Elegy&lt;/i&gt; it&#039;s worth it just for the scene where Kate is outed at West Point, discharged under DADT, and comes out to her father at home. There&#039;s an incredible dignity between Kate and her father. So good.

Is there a history of gay characters in mainstream comics? The first I&#039;m aware of was Northstar, who came out in 1992. (Although John Byrne claims to have intended the chracter as gay as far back as 1983. Then again, he also intended Wolverine to be an actual mutated wolverine rather than a human mutant, so take that as you will.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post. I lurk here often.

No, really. Also, I&#039;m interested in Montoya. I wonder if I could get a PhD for studying the treatment of gay characters in mainstream comics and thus secure my title as coolest academic ever. I would call it MSG: A study of Mainstream Gay.]]></description>
