If you weren&#039;t blazing through the game at record speed, I&#039;d wonder if a minimal playthrough wouldn&#039;t be an interesting experiment--no Vincent, no Yuffie, no side-quests, as little grinding as possible. But even with that I don&#039;t know that I could get to disc 3 in less than 20 hours.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[[...] Posted by Gavin Craig on March 10, 2011 &#183; Leave a Comment&#160;   I think it&#8217;s been apparent to anyone reading my posts over the past few weeks that I felt like I&#8217;d hit a wall in Final Fantasy VII.

I should probably clarify that I wasn&#039;t criticizing you for spoiling Aeris&#039; death. As the sentences after my link state, I&#039;m not really sure it&#039;s something that can be spoiled anymore, and even if it can, we&#039;re way past the reasonable period of time where anyone should feel bad about spoiling it.]]></description>
