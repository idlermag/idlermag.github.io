Thanks, friend! I completely agree with you--sometimes, going out to eat is the only way I can think of to hang out with people. Or even going for coffee or drinks. It&#039;s always something that&#039;s used as a crutch (and sometimes overused when one drink becomes four plus fries and dessert). 

That being said, I&#039;ve really been craving Olive Garden. Let&#039;s go for a run together and then get Olive Garden next time I&#039;m home. Deal? &#060;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That photo brought tears to my eyes. It is one of my favorite memories. If only we could eat and sleep at the same time, that would save time and combine my most nourishing habits.  However, what would be the point! Just kidding!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post! I think the work/office culture that encourages eating alone at your desk as much as it encourages social drinking causes a lot of my food stress. I buy food based on how quickly it can be packed for work and how easily I can eat it at my desk. Bananas and other &quot;hand fruit&quot; are thus the ultimate food followed closely by chips of any kind. Just kidding, I hate chips.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I totes agree. Sometimes I think the stress deciding about food can become too overwhelming, and it&#039;s even worse when you discover that you have some weird emotional attachment to it. I hate macaroni and cheese almost daily for an entire summer because I thought it was making me feel less homesick, but the real result was that I gained 20 pounds and felt fat and unhealthy instead. 

One of the hardest things for me is finding a good balance for times to eat during the day. I know that when Jack spends an hour and a half making a really awesome dinner that I&#039;ll enjoy it even more than usual, but half the time I&#039;m so hungry that the wait just makes me sullen. 

I do think, though...that sometimes using food as a means to conversation/relationship can also backfire. I agree that people should eat without TV and other distraction less (I am SO GUILTY OF THIS) but I also think that it would be easy for me to start eating just because that&#039;s what I would do to have a conversation. This is why one of my fave convo methods is to go running or walking with another person (as you know). 

PS I love your column.]]></description>
