					<description><![CDATA[As a victim of bullying myself, I feel bad for both these boys.  One thing that I regret about being a teenager is the fact that I saw other kids getting bullied and did nothing.  Not physically, I&#039;ve always been a wimp and if anything ever came to blows I would lose, then and now.  But I saw tons of kids getting teased, or just as bad, ignored.  But since I had my own set of bullies and taunters, I kept my head down.  I now wish I had reached out, had lunch with that kid sitting by themselves in the cafeteria, or told the bullies to bug off.]]></description>

Agreed.  Much as I want to just go ahead and write off the girls who harassed me in 7th grade as absolute pure evil, I&#039;m sure there was a lot more to their antagonism.  Two of them claimed to already have had/been having sex at that age.  If an 8th grader revealing (and being a little too proud of) their sexual activity at that age doesn&#039;t scream &quot;self esteem issues&quot; I don&#039;t know what does.  Exact quote from one of them: &quot;I got him, I did him, I&#039;m done with him.&quot;  It seems really sad looking back on it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bullying is often so much more complicated than one-way, as you point out. Every bully is someone else&#039;s victim first, and that thought just breaks my heart.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t seen this video, but it sounds upsetting. In high school I read a book about bullying called Please Stop Laughing At Me by Jodee Blanco. That book broke my heart and, I think, made me a much better person. As someone who loves to make jokes I try to be conscious never to make them at the expense of others. If you haven&#039;t read this book, I highly recommend it. It might make you prouder of 7th grade you. 

Great post!]]></description>
