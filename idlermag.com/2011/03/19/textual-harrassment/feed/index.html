					<description><![CDATA[I really wish I would have saved these awesomely horrible texts I got from a wrong number last year.  
I would get these messages late at night from some guy with a really lame sign-off name, something like, &quot;Party Boy&quot; or &quot;Da Man&quot; or something stupid like that.  
The messages asked where I was, why don&#039;t I come over for a party, he&#039;s having so much fun and thinking of me, etc.  I ignored them all because they were clearly not meant for me and I didn&#039;t care.  
Then I got the &quot;Why R U ignoring me?&quot; text and when I replied with, &quot;Because this is the wrong number&quot; he debated with me! &quot;You know who I am, girl!&quot;  
I had to break it to him that maybe, just maybe, someone gave him a fake number because they didn&#039;t want to hear from him.  It was hilarious because not only was he texting the wrong person, but his stellar human being&#039;s texts clearly revealed he was cheating on his girlfriend, or trying to, with a person who gave him a fake number.  
Just amazing.

Love the piece, Teal!]]></description>
