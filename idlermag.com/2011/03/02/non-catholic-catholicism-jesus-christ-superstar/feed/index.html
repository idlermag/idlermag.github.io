					<description><![CDATA[Sometime in the mid to late 70&#039;s the tour version came to Birmingham, Alabama which is where I lived. The night I took my younger sister and brother to see the play we had to walk through protesters that felt the musical was a slap in the face to Jesus. It is interesting how something that people protest later becomes something they swear they embraced,just to mention another President John Kennedy. People in the south seemed to love or hate him no middle of the road. I am sure in another thirty years people will wonder why they ever disliked President OBama.

I always look forward to reading your articles, I get to actually think for a little bit]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Rosemary,
I grew up in the south and saw the traveling show sometime in the seventies. We had protesters in front of the auditorum saying we would all burn in hell for seeing such a hateful view of Jesus. The south hasn&#039;t changed much but neither have I. I enjoyed reading your article]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have a similar secular love for JCS.  I just saw the theatrical production a year or two ago starring who?  You guessed it, Ted Neeley.  I have to admit that while it was cool seeing the original Jesus, it was a little weird having a dude who is pushing 70 playing a man who didn&#039;t live that far into his 30s.  Also, it made me wonder what a conversation with Ted Neeley would be like.  Playing Jesus and being known as &quot;that Jesus guy&quot; for more than half of one&#039;s life has to do something weird to one&#039;s psyche, right?]]></description>
