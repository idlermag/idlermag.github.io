					<description><![CDATA[Ana, you seem to be protesting, but the article doesn&#039;t really posit any specific enemy of what your defending.  You didn&#039;t use a  single example to substantiate your gripe.  Yet, you claim that sexism is alive and well.  Without clear cut evidence, I feel like you are merely playing the sexism card. Do you suggest your audience should just take your word for it?  I feel like SOME women have this as their default response.  Do your think that there might be any truth to that? 

I personally do not think Wanda Sykes is &quot;bitchy.&quot;  If I had said that, that would mark me as  a sexist.  She is ornery, to be sure, but it&#039;s usually with justification within the scene.  Shes tough, she&#039;s nobody&#039;s fool and she doesn&#039;t take crap from anyone.  Rosanne is of a similar vein, but just to a much stronger degree.  But she has undoubtedly been a bitch many times before.

The male comedians you mentioned, Matt Damon, George C., Seth Rogen, etc., are not really comedians.  The first two are not comedians by choice, but by some odd quirk (Or genius money making scheme) they are compelled to take the &#039;goofy&#039; role - and fail.  Seth Rogen, however, is insufferable.  Hes like the 17th funniest person at a frat party.  If it wasn&#039;t for his heinous, unpalatable speaking voice, he would be utterly non-descript.   

While there isn&#039;t many female comedians on t.v., there is an enormous list of unfunny men on television.  The list starting with said, Seth Rogen, George Lopez, Drew Carey, Jay Leno, Craig Ferguson, Tyler Perry, so on and so on.

Kudo&#039;s to Tina Fey for making it in the industry.  However, she is severely limited comedically, and is routinely shown up by the other main female star, Jane Krakowski. I rarely here women talk about Jane&#039;s role, so are they too guilty of not recognizing true female talent?  My feminist, doctoral candidate girlfriend agrees.  I mention her leaning&#039;s and education to give her opinion a little more credence since it works in these academic circles.  We both love 30 Rock.  However, over watching the first three season, we both giggled at something Tina said maybe a total of 6 times.  The person caught laughing WITH Tina, is immediately called out and ridiculed, mocked - it&#039;s a game.  We have both been guilty, and clearly mocked by the other but again, this guilt is minimal, as is the surprise of Tina saying something genuinely funny.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[thanks, i hadn&#039;t read this one yet.  i&#039;ve gotta say that with all the female comedian bios that i&#039;ve read, i&#039;d be terrified to apply, let alone get a job, with an all male writing team.  it sounds very alienating and sometimes awful.  however, i&#039;ve also seen more positive experiences on the radar lately too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a great post! There have been a lot of articles about funny women lately, which is really nice to see. These are both pretty interesting: 
http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/2011/05/12/funniest_women_writers_internet
http://splitsider.com/2011/01/why-more-women-should-write-comedy-a-mathematical-but-not-boring-study

Also, in the Barr piece, I pretty much died when she described Clooney beating the chocolate number 1 the network sent her with a bat. I found a whole new level of respect for her when I read that.]]></description>
