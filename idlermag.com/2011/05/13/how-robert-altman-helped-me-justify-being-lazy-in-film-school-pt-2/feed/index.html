					<description><![CDATA[I agree, nobody makes films like him. I have always been so drawn into the interweaving of characters still. My first &quot;ah-ha&quot; moment with Altman was when I went to the &quot;artsy&#039; movie theater in my neighborhood and saw &quot;Short Cuts.&quot; Mind you, nothing particularly mind blowing about the film per say, but each story was very interesting and the way they were weaved together was something I had never seen up to that point. I remember seeing that 3 hour marathon and it changed the way I look at film making.]]></description>
