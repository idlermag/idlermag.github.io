					<description><![CDATA[I have to admit, I&#039;m coming at the vegetable thing from a slightly different angle.  My kids, while veggie lovers, are not interested in any forms other than raw or steamed.  As a grown up, I&#039;m longing for some variety in preparation. 
But to that end, you should totally embrace olive oil and garlic as great additions to veggies!  Olive oil is very high in good cholesterol and eating it also helps lower bad cholesterol levels.  It&#039;s a win-win for veggie consumption and good for your arteries-ness.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you&#039;re trying out vegetables. One of my fave things is carrots cooked in brown sugar somehow. It&#039;s really good. 

But, whatever you do, don&#039;t ever try to have corned beef and cabbage. If it turns out you like this food I&#039;ll be really shocked. The worst part about corned beef and cabbage is that it has to cook for like seventeen hours and while it is cooking it emits the most vile smell known to man. After having smelled this awful stench for hours, people then expect you to eat it. 

I just wanted to warn you since I guess cabbage is a vegetable.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know you would probably hate to sully the glory that is mashed potatoes, but it&#039;s an incredible cloaking device for bad tasting vegetables.

My mother knew which vegetables my sister and I loathed as children and planned the meal accordingly:  If she wanted some peas with dinner there would always be mashed potatoes we could mix the peas into to disguise the horrible taste (because we weren&#039;t leaving the table without eating those peas.  My mother WOULD. NOT. HAVE. IT).  
Broccoli was usually steamed and served with a cheese sauce over it, or, if there was no cheese sauce she would allow us to play dinosaurs at the table where we pretended to be brontosauruses eating tiny trees because who was she to stop us from willingly eating broccoli one way or the other?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some good ways to make kale more palatable are to blanch it in really hot water for a minute or two, then shock it in an ice bath.  Dry it off then saute with olive oil, garlic and onions.  You can take it a step further and make it creamed kale by adding heavy cream and butter add the end and let it reduce a little.

Also must recommended sauted broccolini or baby broccoli.

Best of luck.]]></description>
