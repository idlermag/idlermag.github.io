					<description><![CDATA[Great, great piece on one of the most personable broadcasters in baseball! This post brought back a lot of memories for me, as I loved listening to Mario &#038; Rod over the last several years. One of the things I miss most  since I moved away from Michigan is having access to Fox Sports Detroit and being able to listen to these guys. Thanks for including the YouTube links -- I will never forget that Jackson call.

There is a pretty funny Rod Allen drinking game floating around the internet as well. Here&#039;s the latest version I could find: http://detroit4lyfe.com/articles/detroit-tigers/rod-allen-drinking-game-2010.html

I think it would be pretty difficult to make it past the first inning, haha.]]></description>
