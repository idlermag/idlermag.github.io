					<description><![CDATA[Hello and thanks for the write up. Your referring &quot;flaw that you are loved for&quot; is an especially appreciated nod to the film.

Missed in this write-up, however, that this really isn&#039;t about the MPAA, it&#039;s about the Terms of Service and Community Guidelines that govern what content  is and is not allowed on the various corporate platforms we use; what dissenting voices are heard at places like YouTube and FaceBook, what voices are silences, and how transparent that process is.

For instance, in addition to our Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the Brett and Melanie Meets the MPAA we also started a Kickstarter project for the Comstock Foundation Subgenius Grant and Residency Fellowship. But just three days after we launched it, Kickstarter TOS&#039;d the project with nothing more than a form e-mail. We had spent most of the previous two days writing person e-mails to our best contact, including managing editors of magazine and diplomats, only to have those efforts rendered useless by Kickstarter&#039;s unexplained action (not to mention the professional embarrassment.

Very few people will ever put a film before the MPAA, but most of us will use commercial platforms for personal, political, and/or artistic expression. To my mind testing the relatively transparent MPAA content ratings process against these more opaque content ratings systems is a much more important aspect of the project and I wish there had been more focus on that.

As far as Kirby Dick and &quot;This Film Not Yet Rated&quot;, there&#039;s more to that story than most people know:
