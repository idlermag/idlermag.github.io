					<description><![CDATA[Looking back now, with the vantage point of a few months, I don&#039;t think I was being a phony. I was trying to be honest and conflicted about how I was feeling at the time. Do I still feel that way? Not really. Honestly I didn&#039;t care about this event until I discovered that there was a store where I live who celebrated it. 

Oh I know it is an addiction. I remember those feelings vividly.

I don&#039;t hate my life, quite the contrary. I think, again with the benefit of reflection, that I got caught in the grips of nostalgia. And then I got sentimental, which is the un-earned emotion. 

Every second of my life has led up to now, and it led up to when I wrote and posted this story. I wouldn&#039;t change anything. 

Thanks for reading!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. You call the sponsors crooks but you readily admit that you would celebrate the event if you could.  Who&#039;s the phony?

2. Sure it&#039;s just one day, but it still creates more revenue for the store.  Store owners wouldn&#039;t take part if there were no incentive.

3. As a former geek yourself, you should know that it&#039;s an addiction.  They are spotty and unwashed because they spend all their money and time on music.  Yes, they&#039;re trying to improve their own little worlds but who in this world isn&#039;t?  You having a family doesn&#039;t make you any better.

4. You clearly don&#039;t hate the event at all.  You just hate your life.  People who are truly happy don&#039;t &quot;suppose&quot; they are happy; they know it and feel it every waking moment.  Just like you did when you were listening to music 16 hours a day.]]></description>
