					<description><![CDATA[Heh. I just finished Mass Effect 2 earlier this week, and am now looking to get my hands on all the downloadable content. Great assessment of the game. Lots of games claim to have the whole &quot;YOUR MORAL CHOICES HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES&quot; angle going on... *ahemFableahem*... but I feel like BioWare has really upped the ante with the ME games. On top of that, it&#039;s the only game where I really feel like engaging NPCs in conversation... the dialogue system was smooth enough that I would lose hours trying to chat up people and unlock new story. 

Anyway. Solid review. Cheers.]]></description>
