					<description><![CDATA[I need to watch more of Paul Newman from the 1980s on, but there&#039;s so little of that on Netflix Instant. Neither Absence of Malice nor Nobody&#039;s Fool are on there now, but never fear, I&#039;ll be keeping my eye out for them, so thanks for the recs!

Leslie: Yes, Paul Newman is much more than just hot, I agree. Painfully beautiful is how I describe him in that opening paragraph, and I completely agree that he gets even sexier as he gets older. And I know exactly what you mean about wishing you knew him--especially after those earlier films, when he walks on screen, you think, oh yes, there he is. He&#039;s both familiar and wonderful. Maybe I&#039;ll have to do a follow-up post on his later years!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[He wasn&#039;t hot, he was sexy: verrry different (and yes, I am that old). Sexy is when the power of the personality shows in the physical presence. Hot seems to be often very calculated to present a physical package that is irresistible. No hint of what&#039;s underneath. Newman got sexier as he got older. Every single movie I saw ended with me wishing I knew him. The first time I saw The Long Hot Summer I was afraid my TV would melt. Almost did. You gotta watch Nobody&#039;s Fool someday--old as he was, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the young Melanie Griffith was ready to chuck it all for him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Highly recommend adding 1981&#039;s Absence of Malice with Sally Field.  Middle-aged heat - effortless - plus Miami, a then-surprising turn from the former Flying Nun, and a good story that&#039;s as relevant today as ever..]]></description>
