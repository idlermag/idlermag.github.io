My goal is simply to make people who think video games suck to think that only &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; video games suck. Same goes for art, books, film (did you know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hulu.com/the-tatami-galaxy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;absolutely fantastic anime&lt;/a&gt; really exists?). Unfortunately, the journalist and marketing machines often obscure them. But we knew this, didn&#039;t we?]]></description>
