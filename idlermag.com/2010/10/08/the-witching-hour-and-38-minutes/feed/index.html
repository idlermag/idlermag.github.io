I definitely don&#039;t think the franchise would&#039;ve become what it is today. In-name-only sequels are perplexing to people and a bit of a cheat so I don&#039;t think &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; would&#039;ve done any better. Especially in the era of Jason, Freddy, and Pinhead, having Michael Myers to compete was a given. Another cool Halloween-themed movie is &quot;Trick R Treat&quot; which came out in 2006. I should&#039;ve mentioned that one too.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve only seen the first two Halloween movies (I&#039;m sure some part of me is ashamed) and I&#039;m wondering, Adam: Do you think if they hadn&#039;t put Michael Myers in the second movie and gone in a different direction with it that the idea of &quot;sequel in name only&quot; would have made for a franchise just as successful as what currently exists?  Or would the exact same thing have happened and The Return of Michael Myers would have been a movie earlier?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I worked at Blockbuster when I was 17.  I took full advantage of the free rent policy that October and had an audience of one Halloween marathon viewing in my bedroom.  I had no idea what I was in for when I got to Halloween III.  Now, for the last 13 years I have vehemently stated that it was the worst of the Halloween franchise.  But your article and the link to the silver shamrock commercial reminds me that I didn&#039;t hate it as I was watching it--I just had a really hard time getting over my confusion after the screening was over.  I&#039;ll give it another shot.]]></description>
