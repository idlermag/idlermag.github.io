					<description><![CDATA[&quot;...because I don’t have a roommate anymore. Now I have to run from Pyramid Head myself.&quot;

I finished SH2 a few times, but that just makes it worse.  I know what&#039;s creeping up on me, I know what&#039;s going to be there and where I&#039;m going to have to go.

Almost 10 years on and I still won&#039;t play it in an empty house...

It&#039;s the presentation as well with Silent Hill.  The crooked camera angles that hide so much and reveal what you don&#039;t want to see.  The noise filter over the graphics, the noise on the sound track.  The colour palatte.  The motion of the creatures.  The way the background is revealed piecemeal.

Silent Hill 2 is a work of genius.  Evil, evil genius.]]></description>
