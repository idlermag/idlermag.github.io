					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://idlermag.com/2010/10/19/the-hot-corner/#comment-386&quot;&gt;johnshinnick&lt;/a&gt;.

John, I too have spent the last two years with injuries -- after skating thru my entire &quot;real&quot; playing career completely unscathed. Granted, two of my most severe recent injuries were a result of indoor soccer (one inside/outside severe ankle sprain; one severe bone bruise) but, more and more, I seem to be grinding more and gliding less. That&#039;s part of my attraction to recapturing (or even learning for the first time, with some skills) the fundamentals and tricks of the infield. I&#039;ve had two lessons so far, and I cannot tell you what a difference it&#039;s made just learning to get low as I approach a grounder on my backhand or forehand (while running), etc. Amazing.

All that said, when I am ready to hang it up, or when my body makes that decision for me, 100 games a year on the radio and on television seem like an ok consolation prize.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I used to play in a city league made up of magazine professionals. I hated the day when I realized I had to get out of the game entirely. Each season, it was taking me longer and longer to limber up or warm up, and each season I was getting more injuries. The worst part, I could see my aging and my decline in my batting average and in my throwing. Couldn&#039;t hit as far, couldn&#039;t throw as far from one season to the next. Baseball was the only part of my life where my decline was measurable.  Now I  watch or listen to about 100 games a year on television or radio, and follow every playoff game to the world series. No injuries to report in the last ten seasons....]]></description>
