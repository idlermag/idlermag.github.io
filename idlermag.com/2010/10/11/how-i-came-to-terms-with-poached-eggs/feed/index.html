Thanks, Lindsey! I always add a splash of vinegar, thanks to the recipe I got from &quot;Not Eating Out in New York&quot;--I never would have known otherwise!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like a good poached egg.  Over toast = amazing,  Benedict = unbelievable, but over a bean puree soup?   I just don&#039;t know if I can get that cozy with it.  I just made a big batch of white bean chili this morning, so maybe when that&#039;s all gone I&#039;ll give this poached egg thing a try. :)  Also, Jill doesn&#039;t mention it, but a trick for poaching eggs: add a tablespoon of white vinegar to your pan of water.  It helps keeps the whites together.  

Thanks for sharing, Jill!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am also trying to work up the nerve to make my own roasted red pepper hummus. I&#039;ve been craving it, but have heard some recent horror stories about bacterial contamination in commercial varieties (not in the brand I typically buy, but as an expectant mother, you can see why I&#039;m apprehensive). I&#039;m glad your soup came out well!]]></description>
