I&#039;m pretty sure he is. The one they just shot is called &quot;Hellraiser: Revelations&quot; and they couldn&#039;t even get Doug Bradley to come back as Pinhead so they had to recast the role! I&#039;m sure the inevitable remake is on the way too...]]></description>

Is Pinhead even IN Hellseeker?]]></description>
