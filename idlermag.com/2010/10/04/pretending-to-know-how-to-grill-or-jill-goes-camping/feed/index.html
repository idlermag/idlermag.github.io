					<description><![CDATA[Pot pies sound suspicious like marijuana brownies. Other options can be ham and cheese or some mores(chocolate and marshmallow).
How about avocado and basil or artichoke and peppers or bananas and chocolate or pineapple and strawberry or mango and tuna or ???  Hamburger and maple syrup..now that is really going too far.]]></description>

Thanks Lindsey! &quot;Pot pie&quot; is probably a bit of a misnomer, since they are not pot pies in the traditional chicken, peas, and carrots sense. It&#039;s more like a grilled cheese than anything else. We used pie irons, which most people will use to make dessert versions with fruit filling (http://www.pieiron.com/what.htm). To make the pot pie, butter two pieces of bread and place one butter side down in each side of the pie iron. Then, add your desired fillings to one side (being careful not to overfill). I typically do a pizza version with pepperoni, mozzarella cheese, and pizza sauce, but you could add anything. I had thought it might be delicious with pesto, cooked chicken and mozzarella, too. Throw it on the coals, turn it, and you&#039;re done!

...Spelling it out like this makes it look much simpler and therefore less impressive, but they are delicious regardless.]]></description>
