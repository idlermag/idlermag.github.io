					<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I was freaked out by a massive amount of television shows as well... Are You Afraid of the Dark, Unsolved Mysteries, the Halloween episode of Empty Nest... I was a huge baby for the longest time. I don&#039;t think it was until Scream that I actually sought out a horror film for myself - and that was a couple years after it came out.

And Kevin, you should check out The Sentinel. It has the most amount of stars in the smallest of roles - look for Richard Dreyfuss in his memorable role: &quot;Man on sidewalk talking to girl in red sweater&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to have to check out this &quot;The Sentinel&quot; flick.  Looks fun.  Plus, I am extremely uncomfortable with not being familiar with EVERY FILM IN THE WORLD!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I love that these aren&#039;t your traditional &quot;horror&quot; movies--I&#039;m someone who didn&#039;t see her first horror movie until 8th grade, and was traumatized (by I Know What You Did Last Summer). Sometimes shows like Ghost Hunters or Unsolved Mysteries freak me out. My friends convinced me to watch Killer Klowns, and even though I recognized how ridiculous it was, I still had to leave the room.

Thanks for the read!]]></description>
