chapelle is less comedic and more satiric -- i think it would be infuriating, after so long, to be seen as chris rock instead of as a cultural critic. &quot;killing &#039;em softly&quot; is still, for me, the zenith of chapelle&#039;s catalog, because he was free to talk about what HE wanted to talk about, without the pressure to be &quot;funny.&quot; 

tho the black, blind KKK member sketch from season 1 was still pretty close to chapelle&#039;s best critical work.]]></description>
