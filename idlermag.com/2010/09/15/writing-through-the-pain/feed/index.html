Ico is worth whatever you pay for it (incidentally, there is a version for about $22 &lt;a href=&quot;http://glyde.com/products/7945375/ICO?utm_source=google_product&#038;utm_medium=cpc_shop&#038;utm_campaign=google_product&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on Glyde&lt;/a&gt;). And, if you are into the emulator thing, you are absolutely able to play ChronoTrigger on your computer.]]></description>

I&#039;ve been dying to try &lt;i&gt;Ico&lt;/i&gt;, and eying the DS version of &lt;i&gt;ChronoTrigger&lt;/i&gt;, but &lt;i&gt;Ico&lt;/i&gt; in particular is hard to find for cheap. &lt;i&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/i&gt; is hopeful as a rebound though.]]></description>

<p>I&#8217;ve been dying to try <i>Ico</i>, and eying the DS version of <i>ChronoTrigger</i>, but <i>Ico</i> in particular is hard to find for cheap. <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> is hopeful as a rebound though.</p>

No laughter here. I read &lt;i&gt;Deathly Hallows&lt;/i&gt; the day it came out, much of it while I was supposed to be watching the girls while Danielle was at work. I&#039;m not proud, but it was worth it.]]></description>
